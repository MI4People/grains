Political boundaries have broken down for the communities to survive in global economies. The breakdown of the Soviet Union into a number of new states; the mass emigration into the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; the emergence of India and China as new economic superpowers; and the movement of people to the Middle East for new job opportunities, make hard currencies, cultures, cuisines and customs more accessible to people. Technology has made both travel and communication quicker and easier. While air travel is fast and convenient, the web allows us to correspond anytime with anyone in the world.

      "content": "2\n\nBusiness Wealth: The  buzzword  nowadays  is  privatisation.  Large dinosaurian public undertakings are forced to privatise. Governments can no longer manage and fund these behemoths. Private enterprise has reached horizons never imagined before. Worldwide investments and access to big capital funds have encouraged big businesses. Giants like the aerospace industry, computer industry, courier services and credit cards have overtaken oil, automobiles or shipping industries. Individuals too have amassed incredible wealth. Software professionals have become millionaires overnight, by creating just one unique software programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe result of this wealth is that business executives and entrepreneurs expect high quality rooms and business services to make an impression of their financial strength on their clients. They expect  well-equipped  business  centres  in  the  hotel  and  facilities  such  as  secretarial  services, videoconferencing, and telecommunication services as never before. Business entertainment is part of business relations and hotels that provide an array of dining experiences and entertainment, have an advantage. Entertainment would include once in a lifetime experiences with hit stars and actors. In the room they expect facilities for easy worldwide communications and unobtrusive housekeeping services to keep their rooms clean and sanitised.\n\nEmotional Experiences: Guests have become adventurous. They want total experiences that will trigger emotions. A perfect experience is one that will appeal to all the senses of sight, hearing,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntouch, smell and taste. The eyes would like to see unique costumes, lighting, evidence of cleanliness and sanitation, aesthetic room presentations and décor. Guests want their hotel experience to touch their egos, creative tastes, need for adventure and mostly, their heart. They like to hear silence and touch the softness of bed and bath linen just as much as they want to smell freshness of the room. They may touch the underside of sinks or chest of drawers to ascertain whether there is dust or not. The way the housekeeping staff give the service, contributes largely to the touching experience sought\n\nby the guest. They expect staff to anticipate their needs and respond efficiently to them. Guests today are very demanding and will patronize hotels that recognize their special ways.\n\nTime-conscious: The new guest is time-conscious in a fast-paced world. They are willing to\n\nperform tasks themselves to cut time. Many are quite willing to go to the floor pantry for their needs for ice and cold snacks. They are willing to prepare their own morning tea or coffee in their rooms rather than depend on  a  slow-paced  room  service.  Guests  want  speedy  responses  to  their demands of additional blankets or cleaning services to move on with their fast-paced lives. Guests will want immediacy and will not tolerate delays in what they consider fair time. They will be intolerant to slow and inefficient service even if the hotel property is physically attractive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHealth-conscious: Guests are working hard at keeping fit and healthy. New research has made people aware of healthy living. Television has promoted that perfect figure and many expect to have health clubs and gyms in their premises. Many prefer to have a quick swim as the easiest exercise and those properties with swimming pools have an advantage. They are also nutritionally conscious. Health foods have crept into many menu offers designed by qualified dieticians. Health food is an essential requirement in most menus whether it is the T.V. menu or the gourmet restaurant menu. Food preferences extend to vegetarian and fat free dishes. Some want saltless food while others want cholesterolfree preparations. In the room they need the integrity of a non-smoking room or the sanitisation of drinking glasses or toilet bowls. Many may inspect their bed sheets for stains before sleeping\n\nin them or smell their pillow for freshness before laying their heads on them.\n\nValue-addition: This refers to the extras given for a particular price. For example, business executives may expect a free limousine service from the airport to the hotel, free business lounge services, free newspapers and even a free breakfast for the price they are paying for a hotel room. Women may want free admission to the sauna and Turkish baths. Families may want free babysitting services while on their vacations. In the room, they may want extra pillows or blankets, bathrobes and bath slippers and vanity supplies like shampoos, moisturizers, shaving creams and razors. Most quality hotels provide these in the room price itself.\n\nInformation: Curiosity has spurred guests to travel, made easy by quicker transportation and\n\neconomy holiday  packages.  They  are  exposed  to  international cultures and service styles and are extremely knowledgeable. Guests do expect the high and authentic standards of service and have no patience for fakes. They want information of the hotel facilities at their fingertips without having to ask anyone. They want access to their  room  bills  on  their  TV  sets  to  monitor  their  budgets  and expenditures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nD-I-Y competent: Guests are willing to do things themselves, (D-I-Y stands for Doit-yourself).  While  the  western  person  is  normally  manually  competent,  the  vast migration of oriental people to the west, where domestic help is not available, has forced  them  to  learn  to  help  themselves.  Rooms  are  now  fitted  with  mini-bars, microwave ovens and tea/coffee stations. Floor foyers or pantries have shoepolishing machines, vending machines for ice, hot and cold snacks. One of the benefits of selfhelp is that it reduces time for the guest on a fast track.\n\nTechno-savvy: In  addition  to  D-I-Y  competency,  guests  are comfortable in using the web and would like to take control of their living experience over the web and via phone. They want to make\n\ntheir room reservations from the comfort of their homes and expect it to be honored when they reach the hotel. They want to place their own wakeup calls in automated systems or have access to their bills in the room television monitor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nHygiene-conscious: Guests are very particular about hygiene, particularly in taking a note of how their rooms are prepared and those that serve them. They will  not  tolerate  soiled  uniforms,  bed  linen,  room  clothes  hangers, bathroom facilities  and  drinking  water.  They  are  willing  to  sue  hotels  for unhygienic conditions. Most governments give importance to healthy and hygienic conditions in hotel service areas. Litigations on this count have been expensive and have also led to bad publicity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLanguage Savvy: While English is still the popular language in the global economy, hotels with multi-lingual housekeeping staff will be able to attract and deal with multinational clientele. While French and German were the common alternate international languages before, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Hindi and Japanese have now become necessary in the new business communities.\n\nPoint Casting: The term relates to specialization in a very narrow field. Guests will patronize hotels, which have achieved consistent excellence and authority in a narrow field. This has created\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness hotels, convention hotels, casino hotels, group hotels, etc. each a specialist in providing that client segment for their particular needs. Business hotels will provide, for instance, business centres with meeting rooms, secretarial services, office processing equipment and worldwide telecommunication facilities. Rooms will be equipped with writing desks, telecommunication facilities, internet connections etc. Group hotels may provide group check-ins with minimum delay,\n\nbuffets, coach services, doctor services, handicapped facilities and multi-lingual staff for the demands of a group. Housekeeping staff must be aware of the market segment the hotel has positioned itself and serves e.g. casino, resort, business, convention, etc. segments\n\n",

The industrial cycle has now paved the way to a service society, where services, of any kind, are available to society, thanks to the web. The customer is the centrepiece of the service age. The key mission of cyberspace is to create value for the customer. Its credo is to offer the best and cheapest products and services from anywhere in the world. The four pillars on which this cyberspacedominatedage of globalisation stands are: 1) English as the primary language; 2) most transactions in future to be done by Visa/Master cards; 3) the US Dollar as the common currency, though seriously challenged in future by economic blocs like the European Common Market with the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEuro; possibly the Asean currency promoted by the Asian economic bloc with the exception of Japan, India and China who stand apart with powerful economies; the Middle East as an economic bloc with a common currency like the Dinar, and 4) An increase in the free trade between nations with the breaking down of political and trade barriers.

With multi-lingual skills, hotel professionals will greatly enhance their job opportunities globally.\n\nService-Oriented: The future frontline staff will genuinely enjoy serving people and develop it into an art. They would acquire all the technical, interpersonal, and management skills to give an excellent guest experience. They will use technology to assist them in the process. Guest Histories on common servers will help fine-tune their awareness of needs and preferences of the guests. Computers will help in delivering a mere speedy service to an ever impatient guest on a fast track.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCreative Problem-solvers: Frontline staff will be skilled in problemsolving and decision-making. Managements will empower them to make on-the- spot decisions to enhance the guest experience. For example, a room attendant may be able to provide a regular guest with an additional vanity set if requested or a second or third service as demanded. Such decisions were earlier only permitted by the supervisor.\n\nAction-oriented: Frontline staff of the future will support promises with actions. If a room attendant promises the front office agent a room cleared\n\nin twenty minutes, for a guest waiting to check in, she will be obliged to honor his promise within that time frame. If the floor supervisor promises to provide a babysitter to a guest by an allotted time in the evening, the promise has to be fulfilled to maintain quality service.\n\nTechno-savvy: Frontline personnel of the future will be comfortable with fast changing technologies and environments that affect them. Front office software like the Fidelio already exists. New recruits from hotel  schools  will  come  with  skills  in  such  softwares.  Training programmes for the housekeeping personnel will focus on adapting them to new changes in procedures and technologies. A room attendant will be able to deal with multiple tasks from changing fused bulbs in rooms to being able to resolve minor television problems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommission-oriented: Service staff will prefer to work on commissions as part of their compensation packages. They have the confidence to generate substantial secondary income through commissions and bonuses. Hotels will provide a salary to cover the cost of living together with incentive packages to motivate direct revenue generating personnel to bring in new customers or generate  additional  revenues  from  regular  clients  by  up-selling.  Among housekeeping  personnel,  many  housekeepers  may  be  having  their  own database of regular clients to whom they provide personalised service. Guests prefer to move their business to hotels who hire those professionals who already know their lifestyle and preferences rather than having to cultivate their relationships once again with a new housekeeping\n\nstaff. Service staff can get commissions for their repeat guests or they can get bonuses for the good feedback given by the guests and the number of times they return to the hotel.\n\nMulti-skilled: Service professionals will have management skills, technological skills, customer skills and reporting skills. This makes the erstwhile housekeeper a knowledge worker. The titles will also change to accommodate their new roles such as Hosts, Floor Relationship Executives, Customer Service Hostesses, etc.  Multi-skilling  is  a  strategy  to  reduce  staff,  pay  better  wages  to  those\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\nremaining, and have the flexibility to deploy them where there is a need. Housekeepers will learn to prepare guest rooms, take responsibilities in public areas, deal with laundry tasks, manage the control desk operations or manage floral decoration and landscaping. Housemen may double up as bellboys at resort properties or even the housekeeper man at the reception in smaller hotels.\n\nPhysical Fitness: Frontline staff will be physically fit. They will have to be energetic to  work  actively  and  enthusiastically  for  long  hours  on  their  feet.  The  new housekeeping professional will enroll into a gym and make daily exercise a way of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlife. They will be diet conscious and realise that their appearance is their fortune and that hotels and guests expect the smartest frontline staff.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrooming: While hotels have traditionally given importance to grooming as part of the hotel culture, frontline personnel will take their own initiatives to consult beauty consultants to advise the best way they can present themselves. The new frontline professional will visit salons regularly to be more presentable. Mens salons have also opened to give that perfect manicure and hair cut to their clients.\n\n",

      "content": "The housekeeping department in a hotel is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance and aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. Just as the nomenclature signifies, the role of housekeeping is to keep a clean, comfortable and a safe house. It is an extension of basic housekeeping enhanced into commercial proportions. Therefore, just as we enjoy keeping a sparkling home for ourselves and guests who visit us at home, the housekeeping department takes pride in keeping the hotel clean and comfortable, so as to create a home away from home. At home, the mantle of good housekeeping falls on the lady of the house. It is not surprising then that this tradition extends to the hotels as well, where the housekeeper is, in most cases, a woman.\n\nThe concept of housekeeping is simplistic but when one considers maintaining a house of several hundreds rooms and numerous public areas, the task becomes gigantic and more complex. It takes a wellorganised approach and technical understanding to enable housekeeping to cope with the volume of work.\n\nA hotel survives largely on the sale of rooms and food and beverage and to a smaller extent on other minor operating departments such as the laundry, health club, etc. Of these, the sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 50 percent. In other words, a hotels largest margin of profit comes from room sales because a room, once made, can be sold over and over again. A good hotel operation ensures optimal room sales to bring in the maximum profit.\n\nThe room sale is dependent on, apart from several other things, the quality of room décor, room facilities, cleanliness of the room and how safe it is. The criteria by which each guest decides whether a room is good or bad is strictly personal. Since their choices vary, the task of appealing to all kinds of guests becomes overwhelming. To make a room appealing to a guest is the task of housekeeping which has to ensure that the basic human needs of comfort and security are met. Therefore, the personal effort of the housekeeping department has a direct bearing on the guest experience in a hotel.\n\nHousekeeping, as was mentioned earlier, is an extension of the home where traditionally the mother keeps a sparkling house. She ensures it is clean; that all defective items in the house are repaired;  and  that  the  home  is  kept  attractive  with  choice  furnishings,  artefacts  and  floral arrangements. Housekeeping, in a commercial sense, is the same but with a greater volume of activities and challenges. It involves specialised equipment, tools, cleaning solutions, and the technical know-how in their applications. Housekeeping, as mentioned before, encompasses three major functions:\n\nLet us look at each to understand their full implications:\n\n",

Engineering support comes in the way of electrical, mechanical, civil, carpentry, plumbing and any masonry work. The housekeeping staff, for example, will identify corridor lights that are not working; bathroom taps that are leaking, lobby chairs that wobble or meeting room walls that show water seepage.

We have been growing with instructions, information and experiences from our parents, teachers and society. The brain has recorded it all. Unfortunately, what we remember is only 25% of all that we learn. Our awareness stems from our conscious brain. A great part of our experience lie in our subconscious which constitutes 75% of our brain capacity. The conscious and the subconscious parts of our mind drive our behaviour and we are sometimes aware but mostly unaware of those triggers that influence our behaviour. If we behave negatively, it is because of negative influences in our growing years that have come to stay in our subconscious. This means that we use only onefourth of our brain capacity to correct ourselves and define new ways of behaviour when threefourths lies undetected and therefore, uncorrected.\n\nThere are scientific ways to reach our subconscious through sensitivity training, hypnosis and regression analysis. These are outside the purview of this book. The best way, therefore, to overcome those negative influences that drive our behaviour is to develop conscious habits. What is a habit? A habit is a constant, often unconscious, inclination to perform some act acquired through its frequent repetition. This, then, influences our behaviour.\n\n",

When these beliefs are negative and clash, our behaviour becomes\n\nnegative, often resulting in violence. We need to change our beliefs about ourselves and others. How do we get to know our belief system and how they affect others? It is achieved simply by asking others of how they perceive your beliefs. Such a feedback should be received openly and not by defending them. Introspection of these beliefs is necessary to find out areas of improvement. The next step is to define a schedule of improvement by defining actions to be taken and the time period by which such behaviours would be rectified.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "What is a service? It is the total experience that a customer gets through people, when satisfying a need. Service touches all the senses of a discerning customer. Let us examine each component:\n\nSense of sight: Customers like to see a wellgroomed person. Grooming has been touched upon extensively in the next chapter (Lesson 2.4 entitled  Competencies of Housekeeping Staff ). The way the hotel is kept neat and orderly creates the service experience just as the décor and the artifacts that adorn it.\n\nSense of smell: A guest is influenced by how fresh a hotel smells. It gives him or her confidence of the hygiene standards of the establishment. The aroma of food in the dining industry is well known. Appetizing smells trigger hunger and want. The chef builds this into the total food preparation and presentation. We have known coffee shops to crush coffee beans to give that fresh coffee aroma to the passersby to attract them to the restaurant. Similarly, a guest evaluates a server on how s/he smells. A light perfume or cologne conjures up images of hygiene and freshness. A fresh smelling guest room is the first thing that greets him/her when entering the room.\n\nSense of hearing : There are things that should not be heard by the customer and things that should. A customer does not like to hear housekeeping personnel fighting among themselves, backoffice discussions, rude language, slang, technical jargon, etc. What they like to hear is the courtesy shown by the housekeeping staff; the use of their name; suggestions in case of doubt by the guest; low tones and words of etiquette like Thank you, Please, May I help you? etc.\n\nSense of taste: This is the one most applicable to the food industry. Taste defines the customers ultimate experience. Chefs have gone to the extent of providing the experience with innovative use of spices, cooking methods and beverages. It is common to find wine enhancing the flavours of sauces and extracts of herbs to marinate meat. The taste of meat cooked in earthen ovens is different from those cooked on charcoal spits. Taste is the distinctive signature of a cuisine offered by an establishment. The chefs skill provides the experience. Taste can be interpreted in another way as far as housekeeping staff is concernedthe taste of quality service! The investor has already built in taste in the aesthetics shown in the interior design and décor. Guests immediately recognize the quality of the property by the appointments, furnishings, carpeting etc. used in the physical product. They must now taste the quality of service.\n\nSense of touch: The temperature levels in the lobby and in the guest room, the softness of bed and bathroom linen, the fluffiness of the pillow are some examples that create the experience of touch. Housekeeping staff can enhance the sense of touch by providing crisp bedroom and bathroom linen; dust free table tops and counters; smooth face and toilet tissues; etc.\n\n",

      "title": "Understanding Customer Needs and Wants",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "We must first understand the difference between needs and wants. Needs are essential to human wellbeing. These could include those that are essential to human survival such as food, water, clothing and shelter at the basic level, to those that are essential for self-actualization. Wants are the cultural manifestation of those needs. An American needs food just as much as an Indian but he may prefer to have a burger rather than a dosa to satisfy his hunger. While an American may interpret his need to have a bath by wanting a bathtub, an Indian will be comfortable with a shower. An American interprets clothing in terms of a demand for jeans while the Indian the sari.\n\nAbraham Maslow, a social scientist,  explained  the  concept  of  needs  most  dramatically  by proclaiming that:\n\nThis was very well displayed in the famous Maslows Need Hierarchy as shown below.\n\nMaslows Need Hierarchy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe needs start from the bottom and we shall examine how they reflect in providing the perfect guest experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhysiological Needs: These are the basic needs for survival such as food, water, clothing, shelter, air and sex (for procreation of the human species). The hotel and restaurant industry recognizes basic needs and meets the need for food by offering a spread of cuisines, and shelter by providing a home away from home through its choice of rooms. Hotels provide potable water and proper air-circulation in guest rooms. To the employees, the industry provides free duty meals, uniforms, house rent allowance or staff accommodation and proper working conditions. The kitchens and laundry which are very humid and hot especially in hot climates are provided with proper exhausts and fresh air supply.\n\nSecurity Needs: As  seen  in  the  diagram  above,  the  security  need  is  both physical and emotional. The guests want to be sure that the property they are visiting is physically safe from anything that may endanger the body. They want to make sure that their rooms are safe to sleep in. Hotels provide locks, fire warning systems, sprinklers, fire-fighting equipment, latch chains, peep-holes etc. to satisfy this need of physical safety. Guests want to be warned of wet floors and the name of the callers before responding to a telephone. The same\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis true of the staff who should announce themselves when they knock on a door or ring the door bell. A welltrained security staff protects the safety of guests and employees.\n\nA guests need for emotional security comes in many ways. First is the need to be welcomed and recognized in an establishment. The guests want to make sure that the people who serve them welcome them with warmth and sincerity. The staff must be hygienically clean and free from\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndiseases. The guests notice this by the way the staff groom themselves. The guests want to make sure that the raw materials used in food preparation are fresh and that the cooking utensils are clean and sanitised. They also value their privacy as also the fact that they are being treated with courtesy and respect. The hospitality industry is concerned about this aspect for its employees too. They provide safe working conditions and give safety training, especially in the use of equipment and carrying heavy loads, to their  staff.  Emotional  security  is  provided  to  the  employees  through\n\norientation programmes so that they feel secure quickly in a new organisation. Providing job descriptions and training helps the employee realise what is expected of them and hope that they can perform to the best of standards. Grievance procedures, suggestion systems, performance evaluation are all organisational processes meant to give the employees emotional security.\n\nBelonging: Human beings are social animals. They prosper and grow when they interact with others. This behaviour was noticed even in the early cavemen who lived together to form tribes. Hotels are great social spots to meet this need. They have made human interaction into a fine art\n\nthey are the places where people meet and socialize. The popularity of the pubs and taverns called locals since the early days in Europe till today has been precisely to serve this purpose. Local people met at these pubs to learn about new developments in their community and the world. This has continued to date where people can meet here for business or pleasure. Business entertainment has become a part of the relationship building between business stakeholders. Hotels have responded well with ample opportunities for such liaisons. Employees are empowered with this need\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfor  belonging  by  means  of  their  identity  cards  which  identifies  them  with  the  organisation. Establishments provide social clubs where employees can meet for sport or social meetings.\n\nStatus and Self-esteem: While status is the way others perceive us, self-esteem is the way we perceive ourselves. Hotels provide the perfect platform to satisfy varying status needs. This shows in the rating system from one to five-star. Each is distinguished by the pricing, level of service and food offered based on the customers needs and wants. Self-Esteem is a bit tricky. Some people are diffident when they do not understand how to adjust the thermostat in the room. A room attendants intervention tactfully to explain how it functions helps in removing the discomfort without trampling on the guests self-esteem. Customers do not want to feel embarrassed in such public places and strive to put forth their best behaviour. Employees within the industry are given ranks, perquisites and uniforms to distinguish them within and without the organisation. Selfesteem is given by empowering the employees to act with authority. Suggestion Schemes also permit employees to participate in the progress of the organisation by acting on their views and ideas.\n\nSelf Actualisation: This is a state when human beings reach their potential and are able to control and contribute to the environment. The hotel industry has recognized this and has come up with innovative methods to meet this need. Hotels provide do-it-yourself opportunities by installing coffee stations in the room so that guests can prepare coffee at will. Hotels involve guests to help the establishment to respond to their needs. They invite guests to give their impressions of the total experience by filling guest comment forms. Guests now feel that they can contribute to the establishments prosperity.\n\n",

Housekeeping staff are in direct contact with guestseither face-to-face or through telephone. It is known that misunderstandings occur due to faulty interpersonal communication resulting in breakdown in relationships. The housekeeping staff cannot afford to have breakdowns in communication with guests, as it directly affects the image of the property and the resultant ill-will among the travelling public.\n\nThe reader will go through a series of slides developed by the author for presentations at various forums. Each slide will be explained in detail. While communications is a wide subject which covers internal  business  communication,  marketing  communication,  public  relations,  mass communications, etc, this chapter is restricted to basic interpersonal communication. Let us see the number of individuals the housekeeping staff talks to on a daily basis, if not on a moment-tomoment basis:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe diagram above gives ample evidence of the number of people, both internal and external, that the housekeeping employee is exposed to and communicates with as part of her daily routine.

The sender can  be  the  housekeeping  employee  speaking  to  the  guest  who  is  the  receiver.  The  sender communicates a message through various ways (medium). The receiver listens to the communication and responds (feedback) to the sender. Such responses can be in verbal communication, nonverbal communication (body language) or action (physical expression). Most worrisome are those responses that are not expressed immediately but withheld to express to others resulting in wordof-mouth anti-publicity.\n\nLets take each component of the basic communication system starting with the sender.\n\n",

      "title": "Sender",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "<!-- image -->\n\nA sender can communicate in verbal or non-verbal ways. Verbal communication brings in the aspect of language. If the housekeeping employee does not speak the language of the guest, then no communication can take place. The housekeeping employee will immediately call someone who speaks the same language to communicate effectively. If there is no employee who speaks the language then the housekeeping employee will use words to express the message. The word room may be understood by a travelling guest but the word policy may not. The guest may understand  it  as  police  and  get  agitated  thinking  why  the  police  is  being  mentioned!  The housekeeping employee will then try to use the non-verbal communication to supplement the word through gestures. She may use the word room showing a room in a brochure and reinforce the word policy by pointing to the rules and regulations book. This may be an improvement but does not guarantee that the communication has been understood.\n\nEven when language is perfectly understood, misunderstandings can still take place. If, for instance, the housekeeping employee does not acknowledge an arriving guest on the floor, the guest can assume that the housekeeping employee is rude, does not care, is too busy, does not welcome him, is ignoring him, etc. There can be as many number of possible interpretations of this gesture of ignoring as the number of guests. Even though no verbal communication has taken place, the gesture of not acknowledging is a communication that is subject to any number of responses. The best thing for a busy housekeeping employee to do is to smile and say, Good morning. The chances of misunderstandings are vastly reduced by this simple phrase.\n\nWe, therefore, come to the aspect of body language. It is alarming to know how much we communicate through body language whether we speak or not. The statistics below are ample proof of this:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile verbal communication is reinforced by such things as the accent, speed of sentence delivery, tone of voice and the passion with which we say things; body language can convey messages differently or can be made to reinforce the words. The hospitality industry, therefore, gives a lot of importance to the way the hotel employees look and groom themselves. Poise is essential to show professionalism. A room attendant may lean against the wall or slouch while talking. She may say anything but is portraying to the customer that she is lazy, indifferent, non-professional, etc. Our hands are a great giveaway. Left unlocked, hands express all sorts of emotions including anger, accusation, etc. Professional behaviour will insist that the hands are locked behind or clasped in front when idle. It may be used only to deliberately emphasize a word or sentence like in the example of a room and brochure. Body language is expressed in the following ways:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe value of eye-contact cannot be more emphasized. Eye contact indicates a range of positive impressions including, confidence, sincerity, honesty, reliability, etc. Nothing is more loathsome to a guest when a housekeeping employee speaks to a guest while looking elsewhere into her computer or some other object. Gestures like arms hugging the body can convey closed communication. The nod of the head can indicate attentiveness and also disapproval.\n\nFacial expressions are another way to communicate. The hospitality industry encourages its frontline employees to smile while talking. This immediately relaxes a guest and breaks down any negative barriers. Those who communicate on phone too are encouraged to smile while speaking. The tone of voice becomes cheerful. People have forgotten how they look when they smile. A front desk professional will make it a habit to look into the mirror and smile and make it a way of continuous behaviour.\n\nGestures are another giveaway. A shrug of the shoulder can show indifference. Pointing at a guest exhibits superiority and accusation. Doodling on paper while a guest is speaking can show boredom. The trick is to use gestures to enhance a guest experience. A handshake, a bow or the Indian namaste shows welcome.\n\nHow we stand reflects our poise, as discussed earlier. The housekeeping professional always stands erect.\n\nDistance and angle also conveys different images. Standing too close reflects familiarity. Most people like to maintain their personal boundaries. Standing too far gives the perception of distance and aloofness. A housekeeping employee who speaks to the guest while turning her body away from him shows indifference, inattentiveness or under-confidence. Housekeeping personnel must square up and present the full body to the guest.\n\nA lot has been spoken about appearance . It is desirable that public personnel are personable and attractive. The Human Resources department looks into this aspect when selecting them at the time of recruitment. Grooming is another imperative standard for housekeeping staff. Uniforms must be clean and wellpressed. All aspects of personal grooming like hair style, manicured nails, clean hands etc. are monitored in shift briefings.\n\n",

If s/he chooses the wrong medium, the message will not be received effectively. The different type of media available to the sender are:\n\nThe physical medium is the most effective at the work place. A simple pat of encouragement on the back has a tremendous impact on the recipient. Of course, the housekeeping employee is not going to pat a guest on the back as it would show familiarity! We have seen that professional behaviour requires the professional to keep a distance. However, a firm handshake is the most effective physical contact in welcoming a guest.\n\nThere are several modes of written communication . Some of them include printed material, hoardings, advertisements, etc. In housekeeping, the written documents that drive systems and procedures are very vital for communication. If a control desk attendant does not fill the maintenance order form to register a maintenance requirement, s/he will not be able to communicate to the rest of the team that a maintenance request that requires certain procedures by all to follow up on, has taken  place.  (Please  see  Lesson  3.4,  Business  Communication  for  details  on  written communication).\n\nWe have covered verbal medium which is also referred to as oral communication.\n\nMental communication goes into the realms of the mental telepathy and hypnosis which are not in the purview of this chapter. But we can extrapolate that emotions are a give away of thought processes. Therefore, a smile is emphasized to all guest contact personnel even if they are speaking on phone.\n\nAudio communication refers to the bells, telephone rings, car horns and alarms that we hear everyday. They communicate through sound precisely what it is intended for. A housekeeping employee knows that she has to answer the telephone when it rings. A guest knows that his attention is sought when the bell boy rings the bells of the paging board. The bell desk knows that a guest has arrived at the porch when the doorman rings the bell.\n\nCommunication gets more effective when we have combinations of these mediums. So we have audio-visual communication when business guests have a teleconference facility, where they can see each other and speak over long distances. A guest can identify the callers name or number when the phone rings in the room. The television is a strong example of this medium. Audio-oral communication goes into the realm of CDs, cassettes and radio. Music is an important part of communication when a hotel wants to create an ambience in the lobby. Coffee Shops are great at creating ambience when they change the type of music during the day from rock and roll songs to lounge music. The telephone instrument is the greatest invention in this genre. The wakeup call systems are good examples of audio-oral communication when the telephone rings to wake the guest and the operator announces the time.\n\nTechnology is making great strides in the area of communications. Computers, mobile phones, telecommunications etc hold great promises to the way we do things in the future.\n\n",

      "content": "This refers to the actual content of what is being communicated. One thing that readers must learn is to never assume what has been said has also been understood correctly. It takes years of a relationship to reach that perfect point of understanding. Guests who are casual acquaintances cannot reach that level of understanding. So communication has to be very carefully expressed. Let us see what distorts a message:\n\nWhile the points above are self-explanatory, one must understand that communication is best when it happens with people being face-to-face. The sender gets immediate feedback through words or body language whether the message has been understood or not. Fortunately, the housekeeping  employee  communicates  mostly  face-to-face  with  guests.  This  improves  the probability of a message being understood. Telephone communication becomes more difficult to pass a message because the sender cannot see the person at the other end of the line and vice versa. Likewise, passing verbal messages through another person also makes communication a bit tough. There is bound to be a distortion in the message as several experiments has proved. Written communication is better as long as the other person has access to the text. Modern software and common servers allow people to communicate directly to written information. This is a great stride in passing correct information. For example, the telephone operator, the room service ordertaker, concierge and reception have access to a common server that shows the latest arrivals and departures. There cannot be any distortion in the information. The earlier manual system had each party checking with the front desk on phone which had its own pitfalls in communication in spite of the best of efforts.\n\n",

      "title": "Receiver",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The receiver has the greatest challenge as there are too many barriers in his way to reach a perfect understanding. These barriers are:\n\nPerception is the selection of what one wants to see or hear from a total message. A housekeeping employee may say, I am sorry your room is being prepared according to your high standards. It shall be ready in ten minutes, would you kindly wait in the lobby and I shall call you as soon as it is\n\nready. The guest may perceive only the word wait and respond favorably or unfavorably. The guest has selected the worst word that will cause his inconvenience. The wonderful part of the message that the room is being prepared as per his high standards or that the wait is only for ten minutes is lost to the guest. This is unfortunate but a barrier in communication.\n\nProjection is the interpretation by the receiver of what s/he has perceived based on his or her past experiences. The word wait is now being given a meaning which can be interpreted as rudeness, indifference, inconvenience, poor professionalism or being sidelined for another guest. Naturally, the guest is now going to respond in a negative manner.\n\nLevel of abstraction is another great pitfall. Abstraction means vagueness or something that does  not  have  an  understandable  form.  For  example,  a  guest  may  want  a  baby-sitter.  The housekeeping employee can assign her any type of baby-sitter at any time. The housekeeping employee must reduce the level of abstraction by asking questions to further clarify the type of baby-sitter required. She may ask questions like:\n\nWith each question, the housekeeping employee is reducing the level of abstraction. Housekeeping staff are trained to ask pertinent questions to reduce the levels of communication. Sometimes forms and formats are so designed to reduce the level of abstraction of information received.\n\nThe role of  a  sender is also important when receiving messages. A role is the position or designation of the person who has to offer services. A guest may ask a room attendant for an extra blanket but may approach the lobby manager for special discounts or the General Manager for a complimentary stay. Each position has its own level of authority. The modern mantra in\n\nmanagement is empowerment. Managements are pushing greater authority down to guest interface positions like floor supervisors and room attendants. A housekeeping employee may well have the authority to give special discounts and complimentary stay.\n\nThe receiver is also influenced by the context of a message. So if a guest sees other guests being given priority treatment, it will naturally provoke a negative response from him.\n\nEmotions expressed by the sender are a great influence on a receiver. A pleasant and cheerful housekeeper will convey the same cheer to the guest, while a grouchy one will get the same response from the guest. Housekeeping staff irrespective of their personal circumstances have to always present a cheerful exterior and emotion. This is tough, but is the requirement of the professional attitude.\n\nA receiver likes to hear things based on his or her experiences. S/he likes to be wished as per the time of the day when entering the floor or approaching her room. S/he hears this throughout his or her travels worldwide. So when this is missed in any hotel, s/he interprets this negatively. Hotels do take great pains in scripting greetings for all the staff especially those in regular guest contact. This is to bring about conformity to global standards that guests are exposed to.\n\nLanguage is a great challenge to the global traveller. He cannot receive messages or understand them if there is an obvious language barrier. Hotels now make it a point to recruit multilingual staff to communicate with international guests. While English is the global language of communication, French, German and Spanish were credible alternatives because of the earlier economic situation of Europe, that encouraged travel. With globalisation, new alternative languages have cropped up such as Russian, Hindi, Japanese and Chinese. This is in response of the new economic zones that are developing rapidly, and people from these regions are travelling more frequently worldwide. This means that the housekeeping personnel must have skills in the new languages to be able to communicate effectively.\n\nDistractions can be a great barrier in communication. Nothing is more annoying to a guest than a housekeeping employee constantly interrupting conversation to answer telephone calls or to talk to other staff members. Distractions in communications can be caused by pre-occupations with work, loud noises or music, staff talking loudly in the course of their duties, arguments with other guests, etc. Professional hotels would ensure that these distractions are eliminated or kept to a minimum through staff training, scheduling and technology interventions.\n\nBias is a predisposition to a thought or idea. These biases are built through experience and cannot be avoided. A Frenchman may not like to speak in English, or any language other than French. You may call it national pride. This is, however, a predisposition. A guest may check and re-check his wake-up-call instructions to the point of being irritating. S/he apparently has had a bad experience of oversleeping before and is petrified of it recurring again.\n\nIf these are the number of barriers to receiving a message, communication becomes increasingly challenging. The question arises as to who is responsible to overcome these barriers? It is the sender.  S/he has to ensure through training, systems and procedures that these barriers are eliminated at the time of transmitting a message. One of the simplest methods employed to eliminate barriers in communication is to ask the receiver to repeat the message. So when a guest gives instructions, the housekeeping staff will repeat each and every word s/he says to confirm to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe sender that the message is understood and correct. This completes the loop of the basic communication system.\n\n",

      "content": "It is important for housekeeping professionals to know what it means to work in a hotel and the type of hotel they serve. The type of hotel determines the level of service desired and the facilities offered. The guest rooms of a deluxe hotel will naturally have superior furnishings and amenities than those in an economy hotel. Similarly, business hotels in downtown locations will have different housekeeping dynamics than a resort property. This lesson helps the reader to comprehensively understand and place the hotel they work for against several options available in the market.\n\nBritish Law defines a Hotel or Inn as a place where a bonafide traveller can receive food and shelter, provided s/he is in a position to pay for it and is in a fit condition to be received. Therefore, a hotel must provide food (and beverages) and lodging to travellers, on payment and has, in turn, the right to refuse admission if the traveller is drunk, disorderly, unkempt or is not in a position to pay for the services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy this  definition,  a  hotel  must  provide  rooms  and  meals.  The provision  of  beverages  is  subject  to  local  customs  and  practices. Therefore, in Europe and America, bars are an important part of the hotel  facilities  while  in  Islamic  countries  bars  may  be  considered  a taboo on religious grounds. One thing is certain that the rights of admission are reserved and many hotels display that sign prominently at  their  doorways  or  reception.  A  hotel  can  refuse  a  guest  (hotel customer) accommodation if s/he is not in a fit and orderly state. With this tradition, hotels have always been a place where visitors and guests dress  to  look  at  their  best.  The  guest  has  also  to  show  financial credibility. Earlier inns and hotels insisted on advance payment before guests were allocated the room. The credit card has made the issue of financial credibility easier.  Surprisingly, hotels do not accept personal\n\ncheques as a credible instrument of payment. Hotels worldwide also have credit limits as per house policy.  Once  those  limits  are  achieved  it  is  mandatory  for  the  guest  to  clear  the  limit reached even if he or she continues the stay. A hotel, in other words, has the full right to expel a guest for valid reasons of doubt.\n\n",

      "title": "Location",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Hotels may be categorised by their locations as follows:\n\nLet us examine the unique features of hotels, in detail, based on the locations:\n\nDowntown hotels are located at the centre of the city in busy commercial and shopping districts.\n\nEveryone likes to stay downtown within easy reach of the government  and  private  offices,  shopping  malls  and entertainment centres. However, since the price of land is expensive, the rates of rooms in these hotels are high to enable the investor to get a good return on his investment. Investors, therefore, believe in constructing quality hotels to cater  to  a  moneyed  clientele,  usually  the  business  and corporate community. The business community is the one that  owns  businesses  while  the  corporate  community comprises professionals who work for businesses at senior\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npositions. Up-market tourist groups may also find downtown hotels affordable. Usually downtown hotels will cater to guests on short visits which are upto a maximum of one week stay. Downtown hotels in Asia get their prestige from foreign guests as the exchange rate between the west and the east makes even seemingly expensive prices locally, quite affordable to the foreign guest. However, in the global economy room prices around the world are more or less equal. Premium brands of hotel chains and independent hotels of a very high quality are found in downtown locations.  Naturally,  these  hotels  will  also  boast  of  leading  restaurants,  bars  and  night  clubs. Downtown hotels are located in districts that have day and night shopping centres, eateries and entertainment. They may prune their costs by having only bars and an allpurpose coffee shop, off the lobby when guests can avail of a plethora of dining restaurants at a walking distance from the hotel. Nowadays, downtown hotels have built purpose-based shopping malls with food courts and Cineplexes along with their hotel for  the  benefit  of  their  guests.  Many  have  also  added residential apartments and commercial office buildings to create a captive community within their precincts. Because of the paucity of space, downtown hotels will be tower blocks and skyscrapers, building upwards to create space and business opportunities.\n\nThe challenge to housekeeping professionals will be to prepare rooms for sale at shorter time frames as the turnover of rooms is going to be high due to short stays. The rooms will have superlative furnishings and furniture. These will need special knowledge of how to maintain expensive fabrics. Guest amenities will also complement a moneyed clientele with bathrobes, bath slippers, vanity sets, etc. The public areas will include up-market restaurants and bars, banqueting and meeting facilities that are traditional features of a hotel. But now hotels also boast of shopping malls, entertainment centres, residential complexes, etc. that create new challenges for the housekeeping  personnel.\n\nSuburban hotels are located on the outskirts of a city where land is cheaper than downtown locations. Suburban hotels  are  sprawling  constructions  with  ample  parking spaces.  They  attract  clientele  that  are  costconscious, though  not  necessarily  budgettravellers.  Such  hotels promote  there  facilities  for  training  programmes, conferences and seminars. Participants like to get away from  the  hustle  and  bustle  of  the  city  and  find  the environment peaceful for learning opportunities. Suburban hotels have become quite lucrative to its investors as cities are growing outwards making them self-contained mini-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncities. A suburban hotel will soon find itself at the centre of a township that has grown away from the outskirts of the city. Quick and efficient local transportation has made travel to the city centre and back, easy and convenient. With outward growth, many residential townships have developed to make these hotels the centre of activity. Encouraged with these developments, investors have been able to create communities with shopping malls, Cineplexes, residential apartments and office blocks. Travel agents have found suburban hotels offer better room rates and facilities for groups. Suburban hotels, therefore, become ideal group hotels handling volume traffic. We all know that airports are mostly located out of the city for safety reasons. Many suburban hotels close to the airport also gain from the airline crew, passenger layover and transit stay.\n\nHousekeeping professionals will find a different challenge in handling group check-ins and check-outs. Groups are a minimum 15 persons who travel together . They may travel for sight seeing, training programmes, seminars, old boys reunions, etc. Room attendants will have to prepare rooms in volume at a time. In some cases, a group may be waiting in the lobby for the same set of rooms as another group that has just checked out. The pressure to prepare the rooms within strict time frames requires the highest productivity. The public areas may be fewer but the banquet facilities may be larger than the downtown properties.\n\nResort properties are located at natural and man-made sites. Resort hotels will be found at hill stations, seaside resorts, ski resorts, canyons, waterfalls, etc. Niagara falls, St. Moritz ski resort, Miami beach resort, Safari parks and the Grand Canyon are some good examples of resorts around natural resources.  Disney  Land,  Lego  Land,  Universal  Studios  in Hollywood and dam reservoirs are good examples of man made marvels. Historical monuments like the Taj Mahal in India, Pyramids of Egypt, etc. are other sites for resorts. A resort hotel will, therefore, cater specifically to the visitors of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthose sites. Many of these resorts are highly seasonal depending upon climates and holidays to get their clientele. Resort properties have to make most of those times and charge as per the season. They would give heavy off-season discounts to the budget-conscious. Such properties would be geared towards families and couples. They would have possibly one all purpose dining room and have meals that depend on local seasonal vegetables.\n\nHousekeeping will have to deal with a laidback style of the resort guests. Most of them come as vacationers and are not bothered with strict time schedules. Housekeepers will have to adjust to flexible timings of guests. For example, vacationers may like to awake late in the day. They may want additional bath towels to bath several times especially at beach resorts and after sightseeing tours. The resort may have independent chalets spread out over several acres bringing a new challenge of distance to the housekeepers. They have to transport linen and amenities over distances and provide a close touch to the isolated accommodation. The resort may have one all-purpose dining room that needs to be kept ready at all times, especially for the three main meals.\n\nAirport Hotels , as the name suggests, are located in the precincts of an airport. They cater mostly  to  transient  airline  passengers  who  may  be  catching  another  flight  to  complete  their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\njourney. Such guests need only a room to sleep before the next flight. They also cater to the passengers with cancelled or delayed flights.  Rather than wait at the airport, the airlines provide hotel facilities to them. Transient airline crews too find the airport hotel convenient between the flights. The airport hotels have a 24-hour coffee shop for quick meals. It is unlikely that these hotels will have gourmet restaurants and entertainment. They would however have large coffee shops to accommodate a full flight of transient passengers and crew. Airport hotels may provide an all-purpose drug store and a few emporiums with local arts and crafts for passengers who really do  not  have  time  for  city  shopping.  Airport  hotels  have  sound\n\nwake-up call services and perhaps, a cyber café. Airport hotels will be linked to airport air traffic schedules for passengers to check of the arrival and departure timings their flight. A shuttle coach service is essential to the airport and left luggage facilities should be provided for those who have a little more time to visit the city. Airport hotels are simple in structure, possibly two floors high and have the least frills.\n\nAirport hotels can pose a dual challenge to housekeepers of a quick turnover of the rooms as well as of cleaning rooms in volume at a given time. The first task is there because the passengers are staying for short durations before catching the next flight and the second task appears when a planeload of passengers are provided free accommodation due to a cancelled/delayed  flight.  While  the  hotel  management  may  predict  flight  arrivals  and departures, they are not sure of emergency requirements that arise, sometimes very often. This requires the housekeeping personnel to be alert to changes in occupancy at any given time. For busy airports which have a continuous stream of airline arrivals and departures, the airport hotel has to man the housekeeping in full for all 24 hours.\n\nMotels are located, in principle, by the highways and road junctions. It is a lodging facility with 15-100 rooms for the automobile traveller. Motels have independent entrance to their rooms which guests have access  to  after  they  have  registered  themselves  at  the  reception. Motels are low buildings maybe a story or two at the most. With ample parking spaces, guests can park their cars in front of their rooms. They do not have the tedium of unloading and reloading their transport with this facility. The rooms are equipped with tea/ coffee kettles, tea/coffee satchels, creamers and sugar to make their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nown hot beverages. The room also has a microwave oven for the guests to heat their own food. The motel may or may not have a diner and a bar at the most. They may supplement eating facilities with food and beverage dispensers at convenient spots on the floor. Earlier motels provided garage facilities for servicing and handling breakdowns of cars. This is not always possible these days. Rooms are simple and clean with hot and cold shower or bath facilities. Guests have an overnight stay at the most.\n\nMost motels are located in remote areas where qualified housekeepers are not easily available.  Because of this, the motels prune their level of services. They will train local inhabitants with basic skills to prepare a room. Such a staff comes at fixed hours in the morning and is not always available. Many motels are family businesses where the women of the house take up the housekeeping role or multi-skill the reception and housekeeping function. Some motels will contract their housekeeping services to a contracting company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfrom the neighbouring city or town. They may provide transportation for the daily visits of the housekeeping crew.\n\nCamps are located on trekking routes. Automobile travel has revolutionised the way people trek. Families hire caravans which are mobile homes and move from camp to camp, equipped to handle such travel. At each camp, the trekkers could take interior  routes  by  foot.  The  camps  have  large parking lots where caravans are parked. Each lot has a water\n\nhydrant connection and electricity plug-in point to service the caravans. The camp will have common toilet and bath facilities with hot and cold water and an all-purpose diner. Guests would sleep in their own caravans. The earlier camps had spaces to pitch tents with common toilet and bath facilities. Food was cooked around a campfire and people trekked on foot. Other variations are the forest lodges in remote locations that are fully equipped for self cooking, bed linen and water supply, though not necessarily hot water! Payment for the use of the lodge is done at the nearest village office. Some lodges may have a caretaker from the local village to meet the needs of the guests.\n\nCamps and lodges are usually sponsored by state governments who hire local caretakers to keep these facilities clean. It is unlikely that professional housekeepers will find themselves employed, however they could be part of a contracting company who is engaged to clean camps and lodges.\n\n",

Partnerships help in aspiring for medium to large hotels. A partnership is the relation that subsists between persons carrying on a business in common, with a view of profit(1890 Partnership Act of UK). Partners are limited  to  20 persons  only.  Partnerships  can  be  Limited  Companies  or  Unlimited  Companies.  In  Limited Companies the shareholders are liable for debts only to the extent of their investment. In Unlimited Companies the shareholders are liable for all debts of the company.\n\nPublic  Limited  Companies (PLC) are  those  companies  with  multiple  shareholders.  They finance mega hotels of 1000 rooms and above. Las Vegas is an example of mega projects where the number of rooms goes as high as 5000 rooms. Obviously, no entrepreneur can finance such a project single handedly and he will have to raise funds by having several shareholders interested in the project. Let us understand the features of Public Limited Companies.\n\nAt this stage, it is important to know that a shareholder becomes the owner of the firm by virtue of buying even one share of the company and has a voting right at the Annual General Body Meetings which are annual meetings of all the shareholders where the Chairman and Directors of the company give the shareholders a feedback on the performance of the company in the last financial year; explain the future plans and projects; and announce the dividends which are the percentage of profit which the company shares with the shareholders. At the meeting,\n\nseveral decisions are taken by the shareholders who agree or disagree based on the voting rights that  they  have.  Shareholders  become  owners  by  purchasing  shares  which  are  documents  of financial ownership and can be traded at the stock exchange. The company announces a share issue when shareholders can apply for ownership. There are different types of shares as given below:\n\nWorlds largest Hotels: The  chart  below  gives  the  magnitude  of  hotels  by  the  number  of rooms. It is significant that 17 hotels in the top twenty are from Las Vegas with large investments in properties. They are expected to have 40,000 rooms by 2010 rivaled only by hotels in Dubai which will be only 400 rooms short in the same period. Las Vegas rakes in $ 36.7 billion in tourism cash each year with 37 million annual guests. It also holds 22,000 conventions and tradeshows each year which alone bring 6 million visitors and delegates each year. It will be a long while before any other city on the planet will catch up with Las Vegas.\n\n",

Participants may prefer to concentrate on their study than be worried about where to get the next meal. The Modified American Plan is found in hotels that cater to tour groups who like to start the day with a hearty breakfast before proceeding on their sightseeing tours, only to return in the evening for a warm dinner. The Continental Plan is found in Europe mostly. It is suitable for European travellers visiting other countries, who are used to continental breakfasts. Bed and Breakfast meal option is offered by sole proprietors running small lodging places or city hotels where guests prefer the flexibility of eating out with friends and office colleagues.\n\nFor housekeeping professionals to understand, a Continental breakfast consists of a choice of breads, preserves like jam, honey and marmalade, tea or coffee.

The business traveller is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\none who owns a business while corporate travellers are paid professionals. Facilities in a business hotel  include  business  centres  that  provide  meeting  rooms,  secretarial  services  and  modern telecommunication facilities including the internet. The business centres are equipped with modern office automation. A business lounge allows executives to have private food and beverages and will  have  the  latest  newspapers  and  perhaps  a  library.  The  rooms  of  business  hotels  will  be equipped  with  high-speed  internet  facilities,  direct  dial  telecommunication  link-up  globally, ergonomic writing desks and chairs, a mini-bar, safety lockers, multi-channel television etc. Services could include limousine service to and from the airport, concierge service, same day laundry service, health club, access to golf courses, etc.\n\nGroup Hotels are geared for volume traffic at  any given time. Their lobbies are large to welcome  groups;  they  have  separate registration  counters;  they  also  have  a  lobby staff equipped to handle volume baggage; they have separate baggage elevators; rooms that are all twin-bedded; large dining halls to seat several groups at a time; and briefing rooms for tour groups. They may not have all the frills that are there in the rooms of a business hotel because  such  additional  facilities  could  be misused. The hotel will have facilities for the handicapped, medical services for the aged and infant care.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFamily  Hotels are  found  mostly  at  resorts  geared  specifically  for  families.  Rooms  will  be interconnected  with  perhaps  a  kitchenette  and  basic  cooking  facilities.  There  would  be entertainment lounges equipped with television, indoor games and childrens play area. Many would have outdoor children-parks, jogging-paths and independent barbeque areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConvention  Hotels would  firstly  have plenary  halls,  smaller  meeting  rooms, administration offices, large registration areas and  large  dining  halls  to  feed  upto  2000 people.  The  rooms  would  be  mostly  twinbedded  with  modern  telecommunication systems,  mini-bars,  safety  lockers,  etc.  The hotels will have shuttle coach services from the hotel to the airport and the city centre to transport delegates.\n\nYouth Hostels cater to travelling youth. The hostels will have dormitory style accommodation  and  maybe  some  single rooms for those who want to have a room all\n\nfor themselves. Hostels will have common toilets and shower areas, large dining halls with simple food, gymnasium, games courts and fields.

Downtown hotels, Motels and Airport hotels are good  examples  of  transient  hotels.  Guests  need  a comfortable  room  with  possibly  in-  room  tea/coffee facilities.\n\nResidential Hotels are those that are equipped for a longer stay of the guests. Hotel Apartments are a good example of this and are found in many community hotel complexes. The rooms will be suites consisting of two roomsone a living area and the other a bedroom. The  suites  are  fitted  with  kitchenettes  for  personal cooking.  The  rooms  are  cleaned  by  an  outsourced housekeeping service. The complex will have security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nservice with pass-keys to enter the building at night. Guests may lease this accommodation for any length of time upto a year. These hotels are convenient for long tenure business executives who do not want the hassle of running a home. These are ideal in university campus locations for mature students who have families.\n\nSuite Hotels are similar to residential hotels with shorter stay of perhaps six months or less. It is ideal for families who need a temporary accommodation before moving into their permanent abode. Professionals find it convenient to set up travelling offices in their living area without intruding into the bedroom. They would have all the facilities and amenities of the residential hotel except that they may have a coffee shop, bar and perhaps, one more specialty restaurant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMost  lodging  investors  nowadays  are  opting  for  Suite Hotels.\n\nFurnished Apartments are another variation of extended stay properties. The rooms are studio with open, fully equipped  kitchens.  Such  hotels  will  have  reception counters,  lobbies  for  meeting  visitors,  outsourced housekeeping  services  and  a  swimming  pool  and gymnasium. They may have Laundromats in the basement. They will not have eating facilities except for some vending machines. Furnished apartments would have close-circuit television for security. A receptionist acts as a caretaker, security guard, cleaner of public areas and guest relations person who rooms guests. The apartments would have a\n\n47\n\nplumber and an electrician in a full-time role.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Facilities offered by hotels are another way to classify them.\n\nStar Rating is one of the most definitive standards which guide travellers as to what to expect. The star ratings are organised by the State Tourism Department who puts together a team of representatives from the government, hospitality educationists, travel agents, airlines and the hotel industry. They are guided by a checklist of minimum requirements to achieve a certain star. The owner of the property will inform the tourism department of the star rating they aspire for and will set a date for the inspection. Star Ratings range from one to five-star though there are even six and seven stars which are outside the purview of this chapter as these properties are rare. A five-star rating, for instance, will specify that rooms are of certain minimum dimensions with attached bathrooms supplying hot and cold water. The bathrooms must have bathtubs. A five-star hotel will have a shopping arcade with a bank, post office, travel agency etc. They must have a coffee shop and other dining options. It is necessary for them to have a swimming pool, room service etc. From those high standards of investment the hotel rating reduces as hotels provide lesser facilities. Hotels are required to display their star rating at the main portal of the hotel so that the guest can know what standard to expect.\n\nDeluxe Hotels would  normally  have  a  minimum  five-star  rating.  These  hotels  are  rated  as deluxe as they would have décor and appointments of luxury. They would have every conceivable comfort built into the guest experience. Take Burj-al-Arab in Dubai where accommodations are suites that overlook the Persian Gulf. The rooms are fitted with remote control window shades, gold plated taps, etc. Guests are transported to the hotel from the airport by the hotel helicopter that lands on a helipad on the hotel rooftop.  It has a restaurant under the sea as well as one at the roof top that gives breathtaking aerial views. Deluxe hotels ooze opulence and are available only to those moneyed people who can afford the stay. Some deluxe business hotels provide individual\n\n48\n\nbutlers and specialised cuisines. Many older stand alone hotels like the Ambassador hotel or The Claridges in Delhi set standards of luxury. Many palaces, mansions and villas of the royalty of yore have been converted from lodgings into hotels which really cannot be given a star rating for their uniqueness but may certainly be classified as deluxe.\n\nPalace  Hotels are  really  an  Indian  concept  where ancient Indian maharajas converted their palaces into hotels  after  they  were  stripped  off  their  princely privileges. The palaces transport guests into old heritage, architecture  and  priceless  appointments.  The  Umaid Bhavan Palace in Jodhpur for example boasts of a crystal fountain in the lobby and an array of vintage cars in the private garage complex. The beds in which the guests sleep  are  those  where  actual  royalty  once  slept.  Of course, these palaces have been equipped with modern conveniences  such  as  television,  mini-fridges,  air-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconditioning and telephone connections though these things intrude into the original uniqueness of the property. Guests are exposed to rare art and artifacts that are not found anywhere else in the world. A similar concept may be found in Europe where manor houses of the royalty have been converted into luxury accommodation. They are also called Heritage Hotels nowadays.\n\nConvention Hotels are specially designed for such purposes. They have a plenary hall to seat 2000 people, breakout meeting rooms for smaller groups, administrative offices providing all the secretarial,  office  automation  facilities,  ample  registration  lobbies  and  large  dining  halls.  The plenary hall and meeting rooms have state-of-the-art projection and public communications systems required for conventions. Most of the rooms will be twin-bedded to be used as single and twin rooms for delegates.\n\nConference Hotels would have similar facilities as convention hotels but scaled down in size. Many hotels may have conference centres attached to their main hotel to have the flexibility for business, tourist and conference business. The conference annexes will have independent entrances and large parking lots. Some conference hotels may also include auditoriums that are leased out for public shows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCasino Hotels serve only one purposeto serve guests who want to gamble. Las Vegas in Nevada, U.S.A is the best example of the location of casino hotels each more dramatic than the other. The essential features of casino hotels are gaming halls sometimes the size of a football field with all possible gambling games including  banks  of  slot  machines,  Blackjack tables, roulettes tables, etc.\n\nEach hotel outdoes each other in terms of features and entertainment. Hotel New York boasts of a lobby that represents a New York street  with  street  cafes,  steam  from  sewers,\n\n",

With such funds, casino hotels are truly deluxe with the best facilities to meet practically every guests need. Most rooms\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare large and fitted with twin-queen-sized beds with bathrooms with separate bathing, shower and toilet areas. A bathroom would perhaps be the size of a guest room in a smaller property!\n\nBusiness Hotels are  specifically  built  in  structure  and  facilities  to  cater  to  the  business  and corporate clients. This type of hotels has been explained in detail earlier in the chapter.\n\nSports Hostels and Hotels may go back to the time of the Olympic Games in 776 B.C. when the Greek empire was at its height. The games started in Olympia about 18 kilometers from Pirgos, Greece. While Olympia was covered by earthquakes and floods, later excavations showed that the complex had a wrestling and boxing school, gymnasium and dormitories for athletes to stay. Olympic Games were held every four years. In recent times, these games have been split into  Winter  Olympics  (in  1994)  and  Summer  Olympics.  The  holding  of  the  Olympics  is  the responsibility of a state which provides them with funds for complex games villages that carefully segregates national teams and provides them with independent gymnasiums, practice fields and large dining halls to cater to different cuisines. The games villages have special security, medical rooms, dope-testing facilities including a number of administrative features. Rooms are dormitories with common bathrooms for athletes and individual rooms for officials. Nowadays, sport has become an industry that earns mega bucks from television rights, sponsorships and large gate money. Games like soccer, basketball, cricket, rugby, tennis, football etc. have become multimillion dollar industries pulling huge crowds. Events like World Cups and championships have made investment into these games a lucrative proposition. Purpose-built sports hostels and hotels are built  at  popular  stadiums  to  accommodate athletes and spectators of the sport. Essential features of these accommodations are gymnasiums, health clubs, swimming pools, large dining halls, facilities such as doctors specialised in sports medicine, special security to protect rampaging fans reaching their sports idols, dieticians for special diets for sportsmen and sportswomen, trainers etc.\n\nBudget hotels are relatively a new concept that makes travel inexpensive in a world that is getting more and more costly. Budget hotels strip rooms and services to the bare minimum and use automation to fulfil many guest needs. A room would have bunker beds with perhaps a sink in the room for washing purposes. There would be common toilets. A mini-television will be mounted on the wall to save space. Budget hotels will have dispensers for hot and cold foods, ice, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, toiletries etc. located at common areas on the floors or lobbies. Many motels have built these facilities into their way of operations.\n\nSuite Hotels cater to those who need more room. Such facilities are found in deluxe properties or family resort hotels. They would have all the other facilities of a modern hotel. Suite hotels have been discussed in detail earlier in the lesson.\n\nBed and Breakfast establishments are usually small family businesses. A family may have an extra set of rooms in their home that they let out to tourists. This is a typical concept from Europe which perhaps earlier did not have welldeveloped hotel facilities. Ireland and Scotland, for example, supplement hotel accommodation in  the  huge  tourist  season  with  bed  and breakfast  properties.  The  family  of  the establishment  takes  the  responsibility  of providing  comfortable  rooms  much  in  the home style with their dining rooms serving as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe breakfast venue. Breakfast would be sumptuous English breakfasts with a full array of cereals, meats, breads and tea and coffee. These breakfasts are legendary and many travellers could sustain a full day till the evening on this meal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTime-Share Hotels are relatively a new concept of ownership of holiday rooms or suites.  Each room or suite is owned by several people  who  will  schedule  their  visit  well  in  advance  with  the management office to ensure that the room or suite is available. Time-Share  properties  are  located  at  dream  sites  normally  at beaches, ski slopes, hill resorts, waterfalls, spas, etc. People book time for a week to a fortnight. Should they not be free to avail the room for any reason, they can rent their time slot to another person. Sometimes the management company can help in this process. One great advantage of time-share process is that time-share owners can become members of international time-share properties and exchange their  time  with  another  time-share  owner  at  another location.  Time-share  properties  have  fully-furnished  rooms  with kitchenettes. They may have a dining hall with a bar. They outsource\n\nrecreation expertise such as guides, boatmen, ski instructors, Para-gliding specialists, etc.\n\nCondominiums (or  Condos) are another type of accommodation. Here the owner of a unit, which is a room or apartment in a complex of  several  such  accommodations,  furnishes  it  to  his/her  taste  and informs  the  management  of  the  times  when  s/he  will  occupy  the apartment. S/he permits the management to rent out the apartment at other times and the rent goes to the owner. Condos have restricted entry. Owners have their own password to enter the premises. These passwords are given to lessees of their property. Owners pay a monthly or  annual maintenance fee that covers cleaning of common areas; central  air-conditioning/heating  maintenance;  landscaping  and gardening;  water  supply;  security  and  garbage  disposal.  Condo management which is appointed by the owners association may lease space to a grocery store in the basement to provide the basic needs of the residents of condos.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

They have tanks with fresh water and septic tanks for refuse. Some caravans have kitchenettes with basic heating facilities. As discussed before, caravans are moored at camping sites constructed just for this purpose.\n\nRotels are double-decker buses where passengers sit on ergo-planned seats on the ground deck and sleep on the upper deck. Such buses are used for long cross-country tours covering fifteen days or more. The second floor has tiered berths fitted with bed-side lamps, toilet shelf and privacy  curtains.  Buses  are  fitted  with  bathrooms  much  like  that  found  in  an  aeroplane  and kitchens have a chef to cook the food. The buses are fitted with heating and/or air-conditioning facility. Buses stop at vantage points enroute for meals and accommodation in a hotel for a hot bath. The greatest benefit of such a travel is that guests do not have the hassle of packing and unpacking. They are provided with cupboards on board. Rotels were introduced by Conti Hotel Bus Company of Germany.\n\nMatels are fully automated hotels which require minimum human contact. A guest books on-line and gets an immediate confirmation. On arrival, he punches in his reservation number and name in a machine which initiates a dialogue with a virtual receptionist who registers the guest through a close-circuit TV and issues a key to the room through a slot machine. Outsourced cleaning crews come during the day to clean the room and make it fresh and impeccably clean. This concept was started in Japan and is likely to be the future of hotels.\n\nSanatoria are found at spas and other health resorts. The rooms are specifically equipped for therapy including sauna, Turkish bath and Jacuzzi. Meals are peronalised diet regimes for each guest. These hotels have proper dieticians, doctors and medical arrangements. This is ideal for those recouping from surgeries and illnesses. It is also a place for attaining physical fitness.\n\nPalace on Wheels is a unique railway journey recreating the journeys of the maharajas of India. It is a tour from New Delhi, India to the historic sights in Rajasthan including forts, palaces and cultural attractions. The guests are fed traditional Indian food of royalty and served by liveried waiting staff.\n\nGovernment Houses are a composite name for Dak Bungalows, Circuit Houses, PWD Houses and Forest Lodges which are the legacy of the British Raj in India. These were primarily built for government officials during the administrative tours. Dak Bungalows were meant for the postal couriers to rest while circuit houses were for the higher ranked officials. Forest Lodges were built for those involved in Forestry and building the winter capitals of the Raj.  The PWD houses were for those officials involved in road building and laying electricity power lines. These establishments have caretakers drawn from local villages who are multi-skilled to cook, clean and provide security to the establishment. They are trained to give the standards required by the officials and are very capable. These establishments are still available to government personnel and authorised public.\n\nFloating Hotels are those found on passenger ships. Some are permanently docked at a port while  others  are  cruise  liners  taking  passengers  on  a  week  long  trip  around  famed  locations connected with water. The ships are five star hotels with every conceivable luxury including several restaurants with multi-cuisine, suites, ball rooms, shopping arcades etc. Guests are served by welltrained and talented personnel. A wonderful variation of this concept is the houseboat of Kashmir.\n\n52\n\nHouseboats are moored on the banks of the lakes and fitted with telephone connections, modern sanitation in bathrooms and the most luxurious appointments and décor. The roof acts as the sun deck while the boat within has a living room, a dining room and several bedrooms. The houseboat is staffed by the owner and his family, cook, clean and do small errands. Shikaras are smaller boats that sidle along the boat for transportation around the lake. Hawkers come alongside the houseboats in their shikaras , to sell their wares. Houseboats are fitted to suit all budgets from the economical to the ultra luxurious.\n\nHospices have been traditional lodgings in Europe for the Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem. Each religion have their own religious support groups running on charity. For example, the Hokke Club of Japan built specially designed and serviced facilities for the Buddhist pilgrims. They provide meditation centres and monks for prayers. Followers of Islam provide madrassas while Hindus have their Dharmshalas for the pilgrims of their faith.\n\n",

The culture and work dynamics in chain operations are quite different than those of independent hotel operators. One of the differences, to put it simply, is that housekeepers of a chain have to follow the systems and procedures of the principles while independent hotels evolve their own practices.\n\nA hotel chain is one that has several hotels under the same name located at different geographic locations both domestically and internationally. The concept of hotel chain operations is uniquely American, who built hotel brand names such as the Ramada, Holiday Inns, Sheraton, etc. providing worldwide quality service. The benefit of a strong brand name is that a traveller can expect a certain minimum standard of service from the hotel, under that name, anywhere in the world. International chain operations spread into all continents. Individual entrepreneurs were crushed in  the  race  of  this  multidimensional,  multinational  industry.  International  chains  provided  the expertise, technology, and marketing thrust that individual hotels cannot.\n\n",

By adding popular foods like hamburgers, hotdogs and sandwiches, he created the first Howard Johnson Restaurant which expanded to 400 restaurants through franchise. The first hotel was commissioned as the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge in Savannah, Georgia, that expanded into many hotels. The hotel chain was acquired by Prime Motor Inns of Fairfield, New Jersey. The restaurant chain which includes the famous Big Boy is now owned by Hardees.\n\nAnother famous hotelier, Willard Marriott, started as a restaurateur with A&W fast food restaurant chain in 1928. He entered into the hotel industry in 1940s expanding it into a $5.3 billion Marriott Corporation with segmented hotel chains such as Marriot Hotels, Residence Inns and Courtyard hotels.\n\nIn late 1950s another new concept emergedbudget hotels. The budget hotel bought cheap land and offered lodging only. Budget hotels stripped all services like food and beverage, laundry, uniformed housekeeping services to be able to offer a cheap rate. The rooms had no televisions and telephones. The guests sometimes had to rent the bed, linen and blankets for their rooms. The first budget hotel was the Travelodge , Tacoma Washington and it grew into a successful chain throughout North America. Travelodge now has added amenities such as TV and telephones and bed linen as essential to stay in business. Travelodge is now a subsidiary of Trusthouse Forte, a luxury chain in the U.K.\n\n",

In such cases, both become owners of the property and bring to the table their individual expertise and talents. They share in the profits and liabilities on an equal basis.\n\nAnother arrangement that is popular nowadays is the straight lease agreement. A hotel chain reviews a property built by an investor who then leases the property to the chain on an annual lease  bases.  The  owner  becomes  a  landlord  and  does  not  interfere  in  the  operations  of  the property. The chain becomes the tenant and is responsible for all the taxes and recurring municipal fees paid from the operations.\n\nAnother arrangement is the sale of a property by a chain and then the chain leases it back from the new owner under a lease basis, management contract or franchise arrangement. Chains opt for  this  when  they  want  capital  funds  for  other  projects  or  when  they  want  to  reduce  direct investment as a strategy.\n\nThe professional housekeeper has to understand the arrangements between the partners. What has to be known is the role of each partner especially the one accountable for day-today operations. The General Manager provides such clarifications. It is also important to know the systems and procedures adopted by the hotel as also the standards to be maintained. Many a time the Executive Housekeeper has also to advise the owners on the best practice and convince them about budgetary expenditure.\n\n",

      "content": "A franchise is a license given by a franchisor to a franchisee who can be an individual, partners, a small corporation or a group of investors.  The question arises why an organisation would like to take a franchise. Firstly, a franchise is given by an organisation that has over the years developed a worldwide brand name of consistent quality. A guest will know exactly what to expect from a brand name. Especially in a foreign travel, the guests are circumspect of the standards of the unknown properties. A known brand name immediately gives comfort to the guest. Secondly, a franchise generates large revenues through referral business. For example, all Holiday Inns in the world  become  sales  persons  for  the  franchisee  in  a  location.  Thirdly,  franchisors  have  their established central reservation systems to give leads to travellers worldwide about a franchised hotel.\n\nA similar question can be posed of the Franchisor. Why does he give a franchise? Doesnt the organisation run the risk of losing its reputation? The truth is that a franchise is the fastest way to expand overseas. Captive investments are expensive for any individual corporation to finance. Secondly, any new franchisee becomes a new salesperson in a location for the other franchised\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproperties of the chain. Thirdly, Franchise fees demanded by the franchisor from the franchisee generate big sums of revenue without direct investments.\n\nThe franchisee  is  given  a  license  to  use  the  franchisors  concept  of  business,  methods  of operations and name. Both parties sign a franchise agreement which is a contract that spells out the obligations of both parties. One important aspect of the agreement is that the franchisee is required to maintain the qualitystandards of the franchisor. Quality-standards include:\n\n",

Most  establishments  follow  a  traditional  hierarchal organisation structure that has evolved over the ages. We have management at the top, supervisors in the middle and operational staff at the bottom as shown in Fig. 1.1.\n\nManagers are responsible for the effective utilization of the traditional resources of men (human resources), materials (operating supplies), money (budgets and finances) and machines (equipment), etc. to achieve organisational goals. (Please see Lesson 1.5  What is Management?  for greater details on resources) Managers are categorised as:\n\nTop Management: They are responsible for the long term and perspective plans (5-10 years), funding and strategic objectives of the organisation. They would typically be the Owner, Board of Directors of a public limited company, Functional Directors and the General Manager. It would be pertinent that the Corporate Housekeeper and the Director, Housekeeping will fall under this category.\n\nMiddle Management: They lead specific functions in an operation like, the Food and Beverage Manager, Front-Office Manager, Chef, Executive Housekeeper, etc. They make the Short-term and annual plans (1-3 years) for their respective departments.\n\nJunior Management: lead the day-to-day activities of the operations relying on their management and  technical  skills.

They are the face of the management to the guest who recognizes him/her as the team leader. They are the Floor Supervisor, Public Area Supervisor, Control Desk Supervisor and the Linen and Uniform Room Supervisor.\n\nOperations personnel are  the  frontline  and  back  office  performers  of  operations  and  rely heavily on technical and customer service skills.

Incidentally, restaurant cashiers who come under this department may be considered as line staff as they are right there in the middle of operations.\n\nLawyers give legal advice on operations especially when laws are different in many countries. For example, Middle-East may have strict rules against the service of alcoholic beverages, while Europe may have strict laws on smoking and environment.

The Front Office Supervisor overseas the front desk operations as well as lobby activities. The Dining Room Supervisor oversees the kitchen and dining room operations. The housekeeper takes on the roles of the floor supervisors or the housekeeping control desk supervisor. It is significant that small operations would have limited  restaurant  options,  possibly  only  a  dining  room  that  serves  meals  at  all  times.  The housekeeper would then have limited public areas to clean. The Accountant takes over the income and payable responsibilities in addition to producing the statutory requirements such as Profit and Loss statements and Balance Sheets. He is assisted by the Purchase Clerk who doubles the receiving  and  store  function.  Though  this  is  strictly  not  ideal  in  terms  of  food  and  beverage control, the operations is small enough for direct supervision and control of the Accountant. The Food and Beverage Cost Clerk will do all the costing functions. It is possible that the dining room has a dispensing bar to provide drinks eliminating the need for a formal bar. The engineering supervisor is multi-skilled to troubleshoot engineering problems. However, any operation requires specialists like air-conditioning and heating mechanics and plumbers.

In addition, there are staff departments like Finance, Human Resources, Sales and Marketing, and Information Technology. We need to make another distinction between divisions and departments. Simply put, a division is a grouping of related departments. A department is an independent activity within a division. We, therefore, have the Accommodations division which would typically have front office, lobby, housekeeping, laundry, business centre, health club, etc. departments. The Food and Beverage Division would have restaurants, bars, room service, banquets, kitchens, kitchen stewarding, etc. A department can be stand alone also like Human Resources.

Restaurant personnel coordinate closely with kitchens for the supply of guest food orders.\n\nButchery: In  this  section,  raw  meats  are  cut  from  wholesale  cuts  and carcasses into smaller portions of given weight, ready for cooking. This section is also responsible for curing meats like bacon, sausages and hams by  having  curing  chambers.  In  modern  hotels,  the  butchery  function  is outsourced to external butchers who supply pre-cut portions as per the specifications of the hotel.\n\nGarde Manger : It is the section where cold dishes such as hors doeuvres, cold meat cuts, salads, galantines and pates are made. This section would be kept cool to deal with perishable items as also ice carving for buffets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section supplies items for public sale to the in-house delicatessen of the hotel.\n\nPantry: It is the source for sandwiches, fruit platters, juices and shakes. Some pantries undertake light hot snacks like burgers, club sandwiches, grilled sandwiches, etc.\n\nBakery and Confectionary: This  section  prepares  various  breads,  bread  rolls,  croissants, brioches, cakes, pastries, muffins, cookies, flans, tarts, and ice creams. While the temperature in a bakery is hot with industrial ovens, the confectionary is kept cool, as most pastry items have to be kept fresh. Modern hotels have found it convenient and economical to outsource this activity as well. A hotel with a captive bakery and confectionary shop may receive from this section supplies for public sale.\n\nHot Range: It  is  the  main  cooking  range where hot foods are prepared. They have a wide variety of equipment from ranges, which are coal, gas and electric fire and griddles, deep fat fryers  and  steamers.  An  essential  part  of  the  hot  range  is  a  counter  with  hot  cases  to  keep prepared food warm. It becomes the nodal point for controlling all guest food orders. The hot range is where sauces are prepared for various continental dishes.\n\nGrill: Provides grilled items like kebabs, sizzlers, tandooris and other grilled meats and vegetables.\n\nVegetable preparation: Processes raw vegetables into smaller cuts for cooking. There are modern automatic machines for peeling, slicing and cutting.\n\nStill Room: Tea and Coffee are brewed here. A still is a chamber in which water continuously boils. For tea or coffee service, a waiter may insert the teapot with tea leaves or tea bags, according to the portions required, and fill the teapot with boiling water from the still. In operations where there are quick turnovers of tea or coffee, the stills can actually keeping brewing tea or coffee at low temperatures. In coffee stills, ground coffee is brewed and supplied instantly.\n\nSoups Section: Huge stock kettles prepare quantity stock used as the base for various soups.\n\nSatellite Kitchens: These kitchens are located away from the main kitchen to supply food to scattered restaurants in a hotel. Often these kitchens are attached to specialty restaurants with their specialised cuisine preparation methods, equipment and service. Figure 1.9 gives a typical organisation chart of a kitchen operation.\n\nChef-de-Cuisine is the head of the kitchen responsible for planning, organising and controlling the kitchen operations. It is a management position.\n\nFig. 1.9 Organisation Chart of a Kitchen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSous Chef is  the deputy chef who shares some of the Chef-de-cuisines responsibilities. He directs the kitchen operation in his absence.\n\nChef-de-parties are supervisors responsible for a section of the kitchen. S/he translates the managements policies and procedures into the section. A chef-de-partie is  skilled  enough to head a small kitchen operation.\n\nSpecialist Chef-de-parties are those who have developed skills in a specific field of a kitchen. The Chef Tournant is a reliever chef who can replace any of the regular chef-de-parties in their absence. Therefore, this specialist has to have a wide variety of cooking skills. The Chef Saucier is a specialist in sauces. He becomes a key person in continental cuisine, which relies heavily on sauces. The Chef Pâtissier is specialised in confectionary items especially cakes and pastries. The Chef Rotisseur is skilled in roasts and grills and is assisted by the Grillardin , the grill cook and the Savourier , the savoury cook.. The Aboyeur is the announcer of dishes for preparation to various sections, once orders come in from the restaurant. He is also known as a barker who coordinates the restaurant orders with the kitchen. Chef Garde Manger is responsible for the cold  kitchen  preparations. Chef Bouchier is  the  expert  in  butchery  and  meat  cuts.  Another variation  to  the  butcher  is  the Chef Charcutier who is  the  expert  on  pork  based  items  like sausages, ham, etc. Chef Poissonier specialises in fish preparations. Chef Potager is responsible for the Soups section. He becomes another key person in continental cuisine. Chef Communar is responsible for staff cafeteria meals.  Other specialists not found on the chart but are in large food production operations are the Chef Entremetier who prepares vegetables while the Chef Volailler is the poultryman specialised in chicken items and game birds. The Breakfast Cook, Chef de Banquets and Chef de Nuit (the night cook) are all specialists in their own way.\n\nCommis are general cooks who make the food items. They may be given titles of Commis I, Commis II and Commis III based on their experience and skill level.\n\n81\n\nFuture Perspectives: Hotels of the future will prefer to lease out restaurant and kitchen space to branded restaurants than be involved in running them. The leasers will be responsible for running their own kitchens and food service. Hotels may maintain an all-purpose coffee shop, room service and banqueting. The volume of kitchen activity would be certainly curtailed by outsourcing the butchery, vegetable preparation, bakery, confectionary and cold kitchens. Many hotel kitchen and service professionals will find meaningful careers in franchise and outsourced operations in addition to hotels.\n\n",

He is ably assisted by the Financial Analysts who are educated and trained in funds management. 2) The accounts section monitors the revenues and expenditures of the hotel. They ensure that cash flows are available for daily operations by controlling the bank accounts and making cash available through the General Cashier. The accounts section will prepare the statutory balance sheets and profit and loss statements for the investors of the hotel.\n\nThe accounts section has important professionals like the Income Accountant who monitors all  the  cash and credit receivables from guests for services rendered. He is assisted by a City Ledger Clerk who monitors all credit receivables. The Accounts Payable Clerk pays all creditors including contractors and suppliers. The Salaries and Wages Clerk computes salaries and staff deductions on a monthly basis to ensure that employees get their salaries on time. The Food & Beverage Controller takes case of the costs of all food and beverages consumed in restaurants, bars, rooms, service, banquets, and outside catering. He is responsible for the inventory maintained in all the stores and gives independent reports of goods received and issued. The Financial Controller supervises the purchase and receiving which are the parts of the control chain. Figure 1.12 gives the organisation chart of the department.\n\nFuture Perspectives: Routine accounting like payroll, collections, revenue accounts is likely to be given to Back Processing Offices (BPOs) units leaving the department to concentrate on financial management. The Finance function will try to leverage earned capital with investments that will raise further capital for future operations and growth. Accounting software are available that integrate accounting information from various revenue generating centres into financial statements for decision making. Guests will be able to keep a tab on their bills through the room television screens.\n\n84\n\nFig. 1.12 Organisation Chart of the Finance and Accounts Department\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "title": "Objectives",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Objectives are goals (on a long term basis) or targets (on a short-term basis) to aspire for and achieve within given time frames. There are some generic objectives that all enterprises would generally like to strive for:\n\nProfitability: This is different from profit. Profit is the getting of money at all  costs  even  if  it  has  to  harm  the  reputation  of  the  establishment  or shortchanging the customer. Profitability believes that the customer deserves his or her basic due, having paid for the lodging and services. Profitability is a good objective to have for any investor in hotel business otherwise he should not be in business at all. It encourages customers to come back.\n\nGrowth: The next valuable objective of a commercial enterprise is growth. Hotels  would  like  to  see  growth  in  the  number  of  services,  growth  in customers, growth in revenue, growth in rooms and the growth of employees. Growth is essential to be healthy and prosperous. Stagnation will lead to the demise of the property.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSurvival: This is an important objective. Any enterprise is subject to competition, which is trying to woo the customers and employees away from it. Today, the customer has so many choices and tastes to try out something new. An employee today has no loyalties to an organisation as before. They will offer their services to the highest bidder. The survival against competition is an important objective. Enterprises have to survive government laws and conditions of business. For example, if a state is to bring in new taxes the revenue targets would be severely hit. The decision then would be whether to increase room rates or bear the impact of taxes giving the guest the benefit, to survive the new law.\n\nImage: The reputation of the establishment is very important for it to survive. Image in the service industry is very fragile and can be broken with one bad incident. Hotels are influenced by\n\nthe word of mouth and bad publicity diminishes the confidence of guests in the property. Hotels are a popular topic of conversation in social gatherings because they are the social spots of a city and very personal to guests. It is here that guests sleep and eat when away from home. They trust the establishment to give them safe and healthy environments and products and will talk about it to others.\n\nInnovation: This has become the buzzword of all modern enterprises. Customers today are always looking for something new. Very few products and services remain the same. The mobile telephone industry and the camera industry, for instance, are innovating every six months. The hotel industry is not far behind. The turnaround time for service is reducing with technology and guests get instant service. People get experience fatigue too and want something new to challenge their experiences. Hotels offer specialty restaurants offering unique cuisines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHotels  must  try  to  bring  innovation  through  food  and  beverage  offering,  entertainment, promotions and décor. Traditional hotels have given way to floating hotels, rotels, matels, etc. (see Lesson 1.1 Types of Hotels and their Categorisation for more details), each coming forward with innovations to meet guest requirements as well as give them new experiences. In this industry, the saying goes, Innovate or die!\n\nInnovation also has made giant strides in the information technology industry. New software is able to process any possible information speedily and accurately. Some innovations in software are accounting packages, guest history, reservations, F&B controls etc.\n\nAnother expression of innovation is continuous improvement. Employees are now required to give suggestion constantly to improve products and services.\n\nCustomer Service: The customer is the king. Unless an establishment places the customer as its central focus of business, it is going to die in the present global competition. Hotels must meet the changing needs and wants of the customer. Organisations have gone to great lengths to provide customer service. They have created standardised greetings on the telephone; standardised smiles like Disney World who paint a smile on the staff mirror for them to copy. Restaurants have set delivery times like five minutes for beverage orders and twenty minutes for food orders. They have found ways to address guests by name as seen in hotel room service order taking software.\n\nTeamwork: Organisations have given emphasis to teamwork. Not only have they empowered frontline staff but have held teams accountable for performance. They recognize that a hitch in the service chain can affect the ultimate guest satisfaction.\n\nWhile these are some generic objectives of organisations, each have their own set of objectives based on their current circumstances.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The next key word in the definition of management is resource. Every manager has several resources, some of which are traditional and some new because of the changing times. Lets take a look at what Peter Drucker, the management guru, called the Ms.\n\nMen : It is an archaic term for human resources. Women have come in a big way into the regular workforce, especially in the hospitality industry, and have justified this resource to be titled as the\n\nhuman resource. The modern world has brought into the working community other resources like those with different sexual orientation or handicapped people. The human resource is the key to hotel operations and provides the cutting edge to it. The difference between physical products and facilities, have narrowed down. One hotel is just as good as the other in décor, space, entertainment, etc.  The distinguishing feature is the service experience provided by the employees of the hotel. As a critical resource, hotel managers are challenged to get the right employees with the right skills and competencies. Some countries have an acute shortage of skilled  hotel  work  forces  and  have  to  resort  to  non-traditional  sources  of  housewives;  senior citizens; college students; etc. to man their services. Training to bring them upto international standards becomes a huge task. Then there is the challenge of fair wages.  While most countries stipulate minimum wages, these may not be enough to attract the best talent.\n\nMaterials: These are the capital and operational supplies that are essential to running a hotel. Capital supplies in the hotel industry include linen, cutlery, crockery, glassware, etc. Operational supplies  would  include  stationery,  commodities,  perishable  goods,  guest  amenities,  cleaning supplies, etc. The software in computerised operations would come under this category. These items incur a cost and managers have to work under strict budgets.\n\nMachines: These are the equipment required to fulfil the objectives of business. The engineering equipment, fire equipment, vacuum cleaners, carpet shampoo machines, maid carts, trolleys, etc. come under this category. These are expensive and come under capital items that require big budgets.\n\nMoney: Refers  to  the  capital  budgets  and  operational  cash  flows  required  to  fulfil  the  basic purpose of business i.e. to make money. The promoter of the establishment puts in the equity to start the operation in order that it may earn him a return on investment. Money also covers the operating funds to run the business on a day-to-day basis. It ensures funds flow for the purchase of supplies to do business.\n\nWhile the above have been the traditional M-factors of the industrial age, new concerns have risen with the service age. These new concerns, also represented in M-factors are:\n\nMetres: Refers to physical space to carry out the operation. We all know that land and building space are prohibitively expensive these days. It becomes a critical component of a balance sheet. Decisions whether to purchase or lease is critical. Space in the downtown is more expensive than in suburbs. Important decisions have to be made as to where to locate the operation and the probability of recovering the investment in space. In future, hotels are going to lease space to branded restaurants and other facilities. Leases are going to become a way of life for outlets. The\n\nchallenge for all the managers is the effective utilisation of space. Shrinking space has done away with elaborate office cabins and the introduction of work stations. Downtown hotels have managed space by building upwards into skyscrapers. Shortage of space for parking has made hoteliers build downwards into basement parking. The fast food industry has been ingenious in the use of space to provide  cooking  and  service  facilities  in  confined  spaces. Housekeeping has to innovate to manage with less space for floor pantries, linen and uniform rooms and housekeeping stores.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMinutes: This underlines the significance of the time. Time has become an important factor for both businesses and guests. Wonderful windows of opportunities of investment and ideas are opening up and if  the timing of response of the business to those opportunities is apt then that business will profit and be successful. Guests too have become time conscious and want products and services to be delivered on time. We have seen the success of fast-food operations and food courts just for this reason. They recognized that the modern consumer on the fast lane and needs immediate service. Hotels have built in-room tea service to eliminate morning tea service rush of the room service. Housekeeping is conscious of time by adhering to standard times to prepare a room.\n\nMinds: Peter Drucker had said that the only true thing that matters is knowledge. Harnessing the minds of the existing staff and attracting good talent is a big challenge. Organisations have given impetus to learning, and  encourage  their  staff  to  give  new  ideas.  Recruitment  firms  are challenged to get the right minds. We may think that there is a surfeit of unemployed people available. However, establishments do not want just warm bodies as before, but those who have the right knowledge and skills. If innovation is the key to survival, then having a pool of creative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nminds is essential. This is the information age and knowledge has a premium attached to it.\n\nMethods: This is how things are done. Some of the key criteria in determining methods to deliver results are: timing, standardization, quality, customer service and consistency. Another aspect of methodology is to remove bureaucracy in decision-making. It is for this reason that organisations have adopted flatter structures. The systems and procedures must be so designed as to respond to business environments quickly. Adaptation to changing scenarios is a challenge and can be achieved by flexible systems. Establishments have employed computers to fulfil a lot of information and process requirements. Fast food chains have mastered standardisation of products and services.\n\nMeasurement: There is a new challenge to measure quality and performance. Guests have become used to quality due to the technological revolution and expect the same from services. Just as the consumer expects a faultless car, television or washing machine, they expect a faultless service.  How  can  service  establishments  ensure  this?  They  adopt  those  processes  which  are encouraged by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) based in Switzerland. The ISO movement ensures to the customers a basic standard of service performance. Other establishments have adopted Total Quality Management enveloping everyone in the organisation towards quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe earlier concepts of quality control or quality assurance is a passé. The measurement of performance, whether it is human performance, financial performance or equipment performance, ensures  achievement  of  objectives  on  a  consistent  basis. Organisations now adopt methods such as the Management by Objectives, Balance Score Card or 360 degrees evaluation (see Lesson 3.7 entitled Performance Appraisal for details) to bring about better people performance. Performance of finance against the  opportunity  costs  of  investment  pose  another  challenge. Finance must bring good returns to the investor who can close shop and use the money in other lucrative avenues such as real\n\nestate or money markets. Equipment too has to show results in terms of low maintenance costs, longevity and consistent performance.\n\n",

Motivation is achieved through fair wages, proper working conditions and by addressing their personal handicaps.\n\nThe Marketing function: The marketing team provides professional expertise in understanding the market and the consumer segments. They identify the target segment/s and develop plans and actions to reach them, attract them and ensure they continue to return to do business. They also project the establishment as a responsible citizen of the society they operate in.\n\nThe Information Technology (IT) function: IT is expected to introduce the transformation of processes from manual to computerised systems. IT department maintains those systems and help users to effectively utilize those systems for their own benefit as well as the benefit of the organisation.\n\nThe Operations function: Operations is a joint term for the actual execution of what the business offers. Factory production of goods can be considered as operations while the organising and delivery of services in the service industry is considered operations.\n\nThe Maintenance function: A team of professional engineers keep the entire physical premises in working condition to do business. This is through various services which include carpentry, mechanical, civil, electrical, plumbing and water. They also ensure that essential utility services like energy and water is available to do business.\n\nThe Research & Development function: It is understood by now that an establishment has to always innovate to get a cutting edge over competitors.

A claim of the establishment that it has high standards of hygiene and sanitation is not good enough until the customers see the physical evidence of this. Claims without evidence are just empty words. A room attendant who is wellgroomed and wears a clean uniform is something that the customer can see as a proof of hygiene. A clean room and bathroom is another proof. A drinking goblet that is stainless in a guest room is a proof of hygiene. Freshness is another intangible, which a customer can experience by the air of the establishment, by the food they eat in the restaurant or by the freshness of bed and bath linen. These are all examples of physical evidence. How often have we been attracted to the smell of a freshly brewed coffee or hot breads? Sanitation signs across toilet seats or water goblets in rooms are examples of giving physical evidence of a concern for sanitation.

With the prediction of the futurist Alvin Toffler in his book The Third Wave , that society is moving into the service age, we need to look at people who are fundamental to services such as those offered by hotels. So far,  a  lot  of  original  good  work  has  been  done  in  the  hotel  industry  to  develop  such  human resource systems whereby people are motivated and developed for higher potential. However, such efforts have always been confined within each hotel or hotel chain. Todays hotels tend to market their physical product, facilities and services promoting their features to the consumer. The purpose of this article is to stimulate some thought on looking at people as the marketing roposition to the customer.\n\nThe traditional marketing mix have been the four Ps i.e. Product, Pricing, Promotion and Place, in which packaging and selling are also included. Marketing pundits have brought out three additional Ps exclusive to the service industry. Which are People, Processes and Physical Evidence?

Therefore, while Avon lipsticks are marketing a fashionable product, the intangible\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat is marketed is Hope. Similarly, the Lux soap while marketing a well designed scented and packaged cleaner, the intangible that is purchased is Beauty. What we are seeing is that the tangible aspect of a product highlights features while the intangible highlights benefits. Transporting this idea to people as a product there are tangible and intangibles we need to consider. The tangibles are the physical attributes and features that appeal to the senses, such as grooming, personal hygiene, skills, etc. The intangibles, and, therefore the benefits that are offered are efficiency, security, etc. My recommendation is that progressive hotels could consider promoting the people intangibles.\n\nAdvertising slogans could read, Come to our hotel, our staff will take care of your needs, or our business staff are most efficient.\n\nWe all know that in marketing one must take care of customers needs and wants. These are amply researched in terms of the physical product. Have we ever researched into the customer needs and wants regarding the tangible and intangible aspects of hotel staff? To achieve a customer orientation one needs training and development approach from pure mechanistic skill orientation to human sensitivity. For example, a lady executive once arrived by a late flight and checked into the hotel and had an important meeting next morning. She needed a hair dryer. The answer she got from the receptionist was, I am sorry madam, and the beauty parlor has closed at 6 p.m. The receptionist response was not wrong from a mechanistic trained response. If the receptionist was trained in a human sensitivity point of view, she would have been sensitive to the guests need and found ways to provide her with a dryer. Futuristic training should also include creative training for frontline staff to generate several alternatives to solve a guest problem. On spot customer research through feedback could give cues into the psyche of customers so that we can provide them the intangibles they are looking for.\n\n",

      "content": "When we see advertisements and promotions of hotels, what comes upfront to the customer are special cuisines, golfing facilities, renovated rooms, business centres, etc. Most hotels offer similar services and the quality of such services are marginally different. What could be a deciding factor to a customer is the kind of people that are bringing such facilities alive. The customer does not find the answer about the people that serve him He learns through trail and error which can have a long lasting effect on his future decisions. What he would like is some evidence of the quality of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhuman resources that will serve him before he actually experiences them. Here is the opportunity for hotel and restaurants to promote their people.\n\nThe New York Sheraton permitted its Executive Housekeeper to send letters on her own personal letterhead to all the regular clients inviting them to try out the newly renovated rooms and expressed her desire to personally welcome them. The hotel had put her upfront with the customers giving them the impression that the hotel had full confidence in their staff and did not mind a personal rapport of the non-marketing employees to interact with the customer. Similarly some hotels promote their Chef as a marketing proposition rather than the food. Hotels earlier displayed their best employees of the month on the staff notice board at the back of the house. Today many hotels have brought their staff achievers photographs into their lobbies for all guests to see. This gives the guest the confidence in the people that are serving them.\n\nPackaging is an independent field of study and often considered the fifth P in marketing. A lot of money has been spent on packaging of traditional goods and customers are barraged with attractive packages on shelves of supermarkets and shops. Employees too can be packaged in a manner that makes them the unique proposition for the hotel. While uniforms, grooming and personal hygiene are physical elements of people packaging there are other intangibles that can be  packaged  into  physical  evidence  of  intent.  The  Sheraton  Management  Corporation  had developed a multi-million dollar peronalisation programmed which highlighted three attributes:\n\nTherefore, a maintenance engineer working on a bulb in the corridor would respond to a customer query about bar timings and if he did not know, would find out the timings or lead the guest to someone who would know the timings.\n\nThe employees in the Sheraton experience were all packaged to respond consistently on the belief that this would be their cutting edge proposition in service.\n\n",

The restaurant management would then have ensured that a hostess was always available at the door. Perhaps reservationists can be positioned at source markets or airports?

The layout differs from hotel to hotel and depends upon its size and the limitations of physical space. However, a housekeeper must be told the number of rooms, function rooms, public area facilities and the anticipated volume of business so as to plan and budget her operations. She will also determine whether to outsource some services like landscaping, flower arrangements, tailoring, upholstery, laundry etc. to be able to optimally utilize space. Hotel space is valuable and only that much space is utilised which is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of operations. It must be remembered that the investor has to make decisions whether to convert valuable space into revenue generating areas or submit to non-revenue activities such as housekeeping, which in an indirect way contributes to room sales. It is for this reason that the housekeeping department is located in the basement or ground floors, areas which are unsuitable for revenue facilities and termed as backhouse areas. There are a few considerations to be made when planning the housekeeping facilities:\n\n",

Facility Planning is the activity of designing the layout of the operational service areas such as restaurants, kitchens, stewarding, laundry, housekeeping, etc. The design must take full advantage of space in creating the convenience of operations and a return on investment to the owner. This requires knowledge of preparing blueprints; service equipment and staff roles and skills. For example, housekeeping would like to have laundry operations in close proximity to its linen and uniform rooms. Facility planning will ensure that this is made possible. Facility planning ensures that the conditions required for various operations are met. All storage areas cannot have steam and hot water pipes running through them, while the laundry requires steam and hot water supplies. These considerations are meticulously looked into by the facility planner.\n\nIn  view  of  this  the  facility  planner  works  against  certain  objectives  when  planning  the housekeeping layout:\n\n",

It is normally a womans role and part of the middle-management team. She represents the department at the General Managers meetings and ensures that all resources made available to her are effectively utilized.\n\nAssistant Housekeepers: Head a shift as the housekeeping provides twenty-four hour service. They translate the Executive Housekeepers policies, procedures and standards into practice by communicating them to all the housekeeping supervisors and ensure that they actualise them at the grass root level of operations. They substitute the housekeeper in her absence and complete some administrative functions.\n\nFloor Supervisors: Direct the cleaning and maintenance of guest rooms on allotted floors. They control the assets on the floor which include room attendants and housemen; bed and bath linen; guest and room amenities; and cleaning equipment and detergents. They are responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of guest rooms as per policies, procedures and standards set by the Executive Housekeeper. They supervise the exchange of floor linen with the laundry as well as ensure their proper storage in floor pantries. They give feedback to the front office on the occupancy status of guest rooms in each shift as a measure of controlling room sales and availability.\n\nControl  Desk  Supervisor: This  is  a  vital  position  that  coordinates  communication  with housekeeping personnel spread to all parts of the hotel. Her major role is the coordination with the maintenance department to ensure that all maintenance requests are attended to. The desk is manned in all shifts as it is the lifeline for all staff.

They are the eyes and ears of the security team to report any untoward incidents. Room attendants ensure the privacy of guests at all times.\n\nHousemen: They are the male cleaning personnel allotted to rooms and public areas to manage heavy cleaning duties. They move heavy furniture or vacuum long corridors of carpet. They help in the exchange of linen from floors because the sheer volume requires strong hands.\n\nLinen Room Supervisor: Coordinates the exchange of soiled linen for fresh ones with a team of linen attendants. She is the custodian of the linen asset and ensures their security. She maintains proper storage conditions to minimise loss due to damage and loss. She works closely with the Laundry for the supply of clean linen.\n\nUniform Room Supervisor: Responsible  for  keeping  uniforms  in  safe  storage  conditions. Issues laundered uniforms to hotel staff against soiled ones, with a team of Uniform Room attendants and tailors. She too coordinates closely with Laundry for washing and dry cleaning schedules and maintains proper storage conditions.\n\nTailors/Upholsterers: They mend uniforms, linen and upholstery to give them longer life. Some hotels may have the tailors to stitch uniforms in-house. Smaller properties may outsource this activity.\n\nPublic Area Supervisor: Ensures the cleanliness, maintenance and aesthetic upkeep of all public areas like lobbies, restaurants, banquets space etc. with a team of housemen. Her area of control is very large and she has to be energetic to keep it under her close supervision.\n\nHorticulturist: Is  responsible  for  the  upkeep  of  all  landscapes  and  gardens  with  a  team  of gardeners  based  on  the  area.  The  task  becomes  more  challenging  when  landscapes  include waterways, fountains, waterfalls, rockeries, etc.\n\nFlorist: She is responsible for all internal flower arrangements for guest rooms, public areas, banquet buffets, etc. She may be given an additional charge of maintaining a florist shop for sale of flowers and bouquets to resident guests and the public.\n\nGardener: Responsible for the upkeep of an allotted area of a landscape. He may be required to maintain internal plants and roof gardens also where required.\n\nLaundry Manager: Normally a male has a large brigade of washer men, drycleaners, ironers, etc which are discussed in detail in Lesson 10 entitled Laundry Services .\n\nFuture Perspectives: Future hotels are likely to outsource the housekeeping function to professional housekeeping companies who would have certified themselves with a high quality of service. The hotel may keep a skeleton staff for linen and uniform room activity, emergency checkouts and check-ins and lost & found activity. Hotels have already begun to outsource public area cleaning and horticultural activities.\n\n",

A  poor  team  performance  can  severely  damage  the establishments reputation, while superior team performance directly  enhances  it.  Teamwork  is  one  of  the  essential competencies  at  the  time  of  recruitment.  Results  are  the responsibility of the entire team and not the team leader alone. Team dynamics have changed over the years. Let us understand the anatomy of teamwork.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat is a team? A team is a small interdependent group of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.\n\nThe key words are interdependence, complementary skills and accountability. No one person can deliver any goal. It takes a team to deliver results with complementary specialisations and the desire to accomplish objectives and taking responsibility for a success or failure.\n\nWhy should we have teams? Teams can meet significant performance challenges. They have a  common purpose and are able to assist  when  a  team  member  is  slow.  They  harness  the complimentary skills of other team members and have trust in their competency. They can influence each other to be ethical, disciplined and motivating.\n\nWho is the team in a housekeeping operation? The direct teams are the floor supervisors with their coterie of room attendants and housemen; the public area supervisor with her team of housemen. The indirect teams are the head gardener with his team of gardeners; the linen/ uniform supervisor with her team of attendants and helpers; maintenance personnel who rectify engineering problems; and the laundry who supplies fresh linen and uniforms, etc.\n\nWhat is the team leaders role? The team leaders role is to build commitment to the common purpose. He or she fills in gaps in competencies; delegates leadership; is a hands-on performer with the team; makes key decisions and manages external relationships including the management, guests, and suppliers.\n\nWhat are the qualities of the team members?

Associate with winners.\n\nCultivate good habits.\n\nDistinguish  between  innovation  and  taking  short  cuts. Innovations do not harm the organisation, while short cuts do.\n\nClarify problems and doubts openly with the superiors and if not satisfied seek alternate employment.\n\nRebels are those who bring about change. Change can be instituted through dialogue and cooperation with superiors and not by rebellion.\n\nSometimes there are sickness or pressing domestic demandsthis  is  normally  excused  provided  this  is  not  too  regular. Inform the superior in advance for her to make alternative arrangements. Remember your team needs you.\n\nThe desire to be different can be converted into challenges at the work place. Ask the supervisor for additional tasks.\n\nSelf-regulation is one of the empowerment tools given to modern professionals.\n\nIt is important to update oneself constantly with the current rules and regulations. Clarify rules during briefing. Ignorance of rules is a crime.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

This is a critical factor as ad hoc recruitment could result in an excess work force and high wage bills. The number of people would depend upon the structure of the hotel, i.e. block construction or clusters of rooms, number of floors and the number of rooms per floor, number of public areas, size of landscape etc. However, as a guide to housekeepers, given below are certain common norms to aid in determining the manning strength.\n\n( Contd. )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n( Contd. )\n\n( Contd. )\n\n( Contd. )\n\nThe key strategy for the Housekeeper is to multi-task resources. Supervisors must be rotated among public areas, control desk and night duties; housemen must be rotated between floors and public areas; all press operators in the laundry must be rotated to all the types of presses and preferably, to the tasks of the washer man and drycleaners as well; Linen and uniform room supervisors must interchange with each other. This strategy gives the housekeeper to deploy her human resources at pressure points in daily operations. It helps her staff to enlarge their skills and experience.  Multi-tasking helps in filling leave vacancies and her dependency on any resource is reduced. There are some roles that are strictly specialist like that of the horticulturist, florist and the Laundry Manager. Such positions have capable deputies in supervisory positions to fill in absences of the positions.\n\n",

Properties compare equally in terms of architecture, décor and product offered in the same price range and market segment. Investors have spent millions in vying to outdo each other in the physical aspects of building hotels that look almost similar. The basic requirements in the hotel business are the same, i.e.  rooms,  bathrooms,  telephone  services, engineering services etc. of a certain standard. The question that arises then is how does an investor achieve a cutting edge over its nearest competitor? It is achieved by the people who work in it and the standards of service they provide to the customer. It is universally acknowledged that the employees of a service-oriented industry are the difference between a good and bad experience.\n\nReaders may claim that the labour market is full of people then why should the availability of the human resources pose a challenge? The truth is that the problem is not the number of people in the market, but getting the right people. In many parts of the world like Europe, North America and Japan, the birth rate has fallen to the extent that it is not keeping pace with the replacement requirements. This is the problem in those countries where demand is more than supply even in numbers. In regions with large working populations like South Asia, South America and Africa, the shortage lies in the availability of qualified personnel. Though the hospitality sector attracts the largest share of the job market, such people are mostly casual workers, primarily students who work in their school breaks to finance their education. Most would not continue in the hospitality sector after their education. The hospitality sector does face the challenge to attract the best talent of the society who may opt for engineering, medicine and business management. Though there is an appreciable shift in the attitude of people towards the service sector, getting the right people is still a challenge.\n\nIn  Lesson  2.4  entitled   Competencies of a Housekeeping Professional, we  saw  the competencies required of the human resources that work in the hospitality industry. Getting those competencies is not easy because it takes very special people who have the flair and desire to serve people and enjoy it. Skills may be taught but attitude is inborn in any individual as we saw in the Part of Introduction entitled  Understanding Guest Service . It requires professional human resource practices to get the right people for the right job and thereafter maintain them at a high level of motivation to serve the guest well, and retain them. With the result, owners compete to get  the  few  talented  people  available  thereby  skewing  salary  scales  and  creating  ill  will  with competitors. The hiring process starts in the planning stages, well before a person is even contacted in the labour market. Let us examine those steps in human resource planning that make a difference in the hiring process.\n\n",

Some servers are paid wages by the hour while others may be paid a monthly salary. The amount of salary is related to attendance or the persons presence at work converted to their contribution to the operation.\n\nThe Executive Housekeeper must maintain three attendance registers:\n\nModern technology has introduced the time card system that does away with tedious registers. The moment an employ is hired, the Human Resources department issues a time card that is maintained at the time office located at the employee entrance at the back of the hotel. This is a single door through which all employees enter and exit the building. The time office (as the name suggests) is where employees register their time in and time out. The time office is manned 24 hours of the day by timekeepers in three shifts. The system consists of specially designed cards that have columns for the dates, time-in and time-out, and are maintained in racks at the time office. The time-keeper punches the time through a time punch machine each time an employee enters or exits the hotel. This is a fool proof method as machines do not lie. Modern technology has introduced electronic time punch machines that send the data directly to terminals in the Accounts, Human Resources and the Housekeeping Control Desk. Each can monitor when an employee has clocked in and out.\n\nThe registers or time cards are legal documents maintained as per labor laws and are carefully controlled. While registers are used for a year, time cards are issued each month. The payroll section, located either in the Human Resources Department or the Accounts Department, as per policy, calculates the salaries and wages at the end of each month. Some establishments may pay salaries every fortnight to help their employees maintain their personal cash flows. Salary payment schedules are also determined by the labour law. The Executive Housekeeper must ensure some norms while maintaining the attendance of staff:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Imagine room attendants with soiled uniforms? (e) There is discipline in the way employees communicate with guests. A lack of courtesy, etiquettes and manners can spoil the entire experience for a guest; (f) Displine involves following systems and procedures to avoid chaos during busy operations. Shortcuts to service invariably affect standards; (g) Displine entails coordination with other departments and fellowmembers to get their cooperation. If the kitchen decides to slow down\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nits service, the restaurant brigade will be faced with the wrath of the guests as they are in the front line; (h) discipline is required the punctuality and attendance of the staff. If there are no warm bodies the restaurant cannot give the desired standards of service.\n\nIndiscipline happens for several reasons. The table below gives the reasons for indiscipline and how they can be addresses by the Executive Housekeeper:\n\nWhile the above are some reasons for indiscipline and how to deal with them, the following are some general guidelines to maintain a disciplined team:\n\n",

      "content": "The scheduling  of  employees  of  a  housekeeping  department  is  very demanding and critical  as  it  has  a  large  workforce  and  the  greatest proportion of employee hours to cover. Moreover unlike the restaurant and  bar,  which  generate  revenues  that  cover  employee  costs, housekeeping  is  a  cost  centre.  Revenue  centres  can  afford  to  add employees as the potential for revenue increases. Housekeeping does not have this flexibility. Each employee added has to meticulously justify the cost of such addition. The housekeeping department is very visible to customers and any deficiency in standards of housekeeping is immediately noticed. The Executive Housekeeper is challenged to ensure the right\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmix of employees that uphold the tasks of keeping a clean house to the highest standards.\n\nThe Housekeeping Department can have an elaborate employee structure depending on the size of hotel. The Housekeeping Department has many positions like the housekeeper and assistant housekeepers, room attendants, housemen, cleaners for employees locker rooms, cloakroom attendants, valets, uniform and linen keeper, etc. The employee hours depend on the hotel and type of customer, business people require different time schedules than people on holiday with children. The employee needs to be scheduled accordingly and in a ratio to the number of guests staying in the hotel. Fortunately, most people book ahead and the workload is known well in advance, especially during peak periods.\n\nThe scheduling of employees ensures that the demands during the business hours are met. The schedule must show a human face in taking into account each employees special requests for leave as far as possible without affecting service. Employees must be rotated equitably through shifts and holidays. Hotel business is a 7-day business and not all employees can get leave on the same day. Guests stay  in  the  hotel  even  on  weekends  and  national  holidays.  Housekeeping employees have to be on duty to give the guests their service. The off-days have to be distributed fairly on a round-robin basis as given in the schedule below. The schedule must be made at least three  or  four  days  before  it  becomes  effective  to  enable  employees  to  plan  their  personal commitments to meet their duty hours. Every schedule is authorized by the Executive Housekeeper who is responsible for the human resources and their deployment. The schedule must ensure optimal deployment to ensure that peak hours are fully serviced with competent employees. Busy hotels like downtown hotels, business hotels or airport hotels run a 24 ¥ 7 operation have morning, afternoon, and night shifts. The simplest way to schedule employees is given on next page.\n\nOne observes that each employee gets a day off in the week. A relievers position is created to substitute the employee on leave on a particular day.\n\n",

      "title": "Considerations while Scheduling",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "However, employees scheduling may not be as simple when it comes to large busy hotels. Employee requirements will depend on the occupancy of  the  hotel.  The  numbers  change  appreciably during  peak  season  and  off  season.  The  challenge  to  a  housekeeper  is  whether  to  man housekeeping at 100% occupancy and carry the cost over low occupancy periods or man the housekeeping to the yearly average occupancy and manage peak periods with part-timers during full occupancy. While this may appear the best solution, the Executive Housekeeper is faced with\n\nother  challenges  such  as  the  ready  availability  of  part-timers  when  needed;  the  standards  of productivity and quality provided by part-timers; the higher costs of wages in season; the time required to train them before they are made operational; whether part-timers can be relied upon or not to reveal confidential information to competitors; and whether they can readily become part of the housekeeping team.\n\nScheduling takes into account productivity standards . It is possible to get quite good estimates of employee numbers based on average times to do tasks, such as cleaning a room. Then we can allocate 10, or 15, or even 20 rooms to each room attendant based on how busy the hotel is. A standard practice is to allot 16 rooms to a room attendant. It is quite easy to estimate the total number of employees needed in a year by dividing the total man hours required by the productivity standard. For example, cleaning an occupied room takes 30mins, en-suite bathroom 6mins and then 4 minutes are taken for loading carts and tea breaks, all this amounts to 40 minutes for every departure room. Then in an eight hour of 480 minutes, a room attendant can complete 12 occupied rooms. A hotel with 100 rooms (all occupied) needs 8 room attendants per shift. Then we can sum this up for a year of 365 days, which comes to 2900 room attendant days per year. We can then divide this by the number of days a room attendant works per year, say 240, and arrive at a figure of 12 full time room attendants. Hence we can recruit 12 room attendants and start using them on the rooms. This hasnt taken into account the average occupancy, sickness rates, and a lot of other things which readily come to mind, because at this point, the difficult thing is to find a way of sharing the yearly workload on a day by day basis. This is the difficult part, just how to allocate the room attendants so that there are just the right number on every day.\n\nA lot also depends on where the hotel is at the moment. Scheduling for an existing hotel is different to a new hotel. While existing hotels have past records to rely on, new hotels will have to depend on data such as average occupancy expected, mix of guests, e.g. individuals or families etc. from competing hotels or published materials.\n\nInnovative software is  available  in  the  market  like  Visual  Rota  which  can  plan  the  entire complexities involved in a moment. However, such software does require realistic input. Software for new hotels will start with the daily hour totals to tell how many employees are needed each day. If this is fed into the software, it will calculate a schedule for a 13-14 week period by naming non-existent  employees,  as  RM1,  RM2,  etc.  It  will  allocate  shifts  according  to  the  expected occupancy anticipated. One can factor in full-time or part-time employees, working full shifts, half shifts and split shifts. It calculates the employee days off, usually in the ratio of 1 day for every 6 days. In view of the critical nature of housekeeping operations, it is advisable to use full-time employees as much as possible if they are cheaper, and fill in odd days in the calculations with parttime employees. The Executive Housekeeper can recruit the employees in accordance with her requirements and allocate shifts to the employees weeks in advance, possibly months.\n\nAt some stage the Executive Housekeeper will need to deal with holidays and  employee turnover. All employees take annual holidays but it is difficult to know in advance when this is going to be. Therefore, the Executive Housekeeper must take out an Annual Leave Plan at the beginning of the year and fill in employee requests for leave. Employees, in other words, have to plan in advance their leave in conjunction with work requirements. Employees are required to give their first and second choices of leave dates. The housekeeper normally will grant first choice of annual leave dates. However, if there is a clash of dates with others, she will opt for the second choice. Busy hotels may require a third choice as well. The advantage of advance planning is that both  the  Executive  Housekeeper  and  the  employee  are  synchronized  in  leave  dates.  The housekeeper also knows the dates when to make alternative arrangements.\n\nAs regards staff turnover ,  the  Executive Housekeeper has to depend on past records of turnover and use it as a guideline. New hotels may have a problem and one can only make a guess. Past records provided by the Human Resource Department of existing hotels will also show the pattern of absenteeism, sickness and holidays. This pattern can be fed into scheduling software which makes some predictions. It makes a lot of sense for an Executive Housekeeper to budget scheduling software into the housekeeping capital budget. The housekeepers budget can then include hiring costs and recruitment plans.\n\nScheduling also has to factor in training days of employees in addition to sickness, absenteeism, lateness, frequency of requests and holidays.\n\nScheduling can be improved by improvements in work practices . Scheduling software can help existing hotels to analyse work practices and recommend improvements.  Savings made on improvements in work practices can be routed as incentives to employees to increase motivation and reduce turnover.\n\nSchedules must move employees around to minimize the effects of peaks and troughs in occupancy levels. The housekeeper can bring in more employees when needed and give them days off during slack periods. A good work schedule keeps track of employee hours and shifts, so that everyone gets exactly the right number of hours to work at the least cost for the hotel.\n\nThere is always a compromise between the number of employees doing a particular job and the cover they provide. If there is only one housekeeper, then the maximum cover would be 48\n\n",

Being informal, the note can be torn and disposed with the result that there is no record. The housekeeper leaves informal notes as she is busy and does not want to forget an instruction that she intends to give. It is a good practice for a professional to note down ideas that flash through mind or to take action when a telephone call is made. For example, a housekeeper may receive a request for baby-sitting services from a guest on phone. Before she proceeds on to her next task she will like to note the request and hand it over to the Control Desk. It is a good practice for professionals to keep a jotter pad in the pocket to note down thoughts in the course of their busy schedules.\n\nMemorandums are very important written communications in any organisation. Memos are written for internal communication and replaces tedious letters. Memos are accepted as formal communication and have all the advantages and disadvantages of written communication. The diagram below gives the format of a typical memorandum.

Today we see the use of computers in every aspect of  business  life.  New  software  makes  processing  of information  easier.  Changes  like  these  require  new knowledge and skills. Technology has made vast strides in our daily lives. It is not surprising that technology has crept into the hospitality industry, which has traditionally been a hands-on industry. We see micros in food operations, networked reporting systems, wake-up call software, Mini bars, Food dispensers in hotel floors, etc. Obsolescence is becoming a word much feared these days. Technology is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngetting outdated every eighteen months. Camera and mobile telephone industries are changing technology every six months. Housekeeping students and professionals need to keep up to date in their careers, to survive. Progressive hotels must build training into their way of life.\n\nTo start with, we need to distinguish between training, development and education.\n\nTraining is the learning process in which an employee acquires the knowledge, skills and attitudes that lead to changes in behaviour to meet some performance objectives. Therefore, training is performance driven and used in work environments.\n\nDevelopment is the continuous improvement of the human capital. Employees with experience need to develop for higher positions as their jobs enlarge and enrich.\n\nEducation is  learning that contributes to total life growth. The time we went to school and college was indeed boring because we wondered how trigonometry, history or social science would help us in our career. Education is not performance driven, but a system to help us adjust to the environment around us and assimilate it better. The new buzzword in the work context is continuous education. Unless we update ourselves in the way life is unfolding we are soon to become outdated in our thinking. As a matter of fact, continuous education is not a luxury but a means of survival nowadays.\n\n",

The conferences have a plenary session that includes  everybody  followed  by  smaller  groups  who discuss issues to solve specific problems.\n\nField Trips are used to expose learners to locations, which cannot be reproduced in a classroom.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The much used term a born leader comes from the pre-industrial age of kings when leadership roles were hereditary. A prince was born into a leadership role whether he was intrinsically a leader or not. This led social scientists of the day to list traits that suited a king and the princes were cajoled or beaten into those traits. A leader, therefore, had to have traits like self-discipline; power command; decision-making; good communication, etc. This was the thumb rule for good rulers. As situations changed social scientists found it difficult to reach agreement on a common set of leadership traits.\n\nThis led to an approach of defining styles. The styles were based on who made decisions. From this emerged the following styles:\n\nAutocratic style\n\nleader asks others but makes the final decision\n\nDictatorial style\n\nleader makes all decisions\n\nPersuasive style\n\nleader sells ideas of decisions already made\n\nDemocratic style\n\nleader involves all and goes by the majority vote\n\nAuthoritarian style\n\nleader defines scope of authority and monitors it\n\nBureaucratic style\n\nleader makes decisions by the rule book\n\nCharismatic style\n\nleader makes decisions by his sheer personality\n\nDelegative style\n\nleader gives broad parameters within which people make their own decisions.\n\nThis approach believed that leaders could effectively control the behaviour of their subordinates. They adopted a style that they were most comfortable with based on their own personality. There has been no consensus as to which style is the best. In fact, later studies showed that styles can be the best in certain situations. For example, a dictatorial style would fit in well in a fire emergency, while communicating a change in policy will require a persuasive style. There is no leadership style that is a success in all situations. Situations, therefore, dictate the best style for the occasion.\n\nIt was well into the industrial revolution that organisations started thinking about leadership and motivation when organisations were concerned about productivity to produce as many goods in a shift. They turned their attention to social scientists for help. One of the forerunners of those times was Douglas McGregor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who discovered that managers tended to create situations at the workplace that they are most comfortable with. He detected two distinct leadership styles which he termed Theory X style and Theory Y style. His study found that the attitude of the leader was crucial to success and productivity. Theory X leaders believed that people do not like to work; that they have to be cajoled to work; that they should rather be told what to do than left to think for themselves. In other words, the leaders were dictatorial and authoritarian. This seemed to be a rather archaic style of leadership that outlived its time because workers were educated and intelligent now. The other end of the pendulum was the Theory Y leader who believed: people do not like or dislike work but develop an attitude towards work based on experiences; while authoritarian methods get things done, they have severe side effects. There are other kinds of styles to employ; people set goals for themselves if they see some possibility of a reward, either material or psychological; and finally if people are\n\ngiven the right circumstances they do not shun responsibility. While Theory Y did not achieve dramatic  results  and  transformation  as  Theory  X  did,  the  people  were  more  psychologically secure and work went on even in the absence of the leader. Theory Y was a great step in thinking, perfected over the years.\n\nBlake and Mouton made another great frog leap in leadership study. They were able to define leadership on a bi-dimensional grid that had 81 situations, as shown below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn this grid leadership style is based on two factorstask and people.\n\nPeople low, Task high (9.1): Here the leader gives task the highest importance at the cost of people considerations. Team leaders prioritise work and determine outputs desired. They are comfortable with systems and rules and can set high standards. They lead with close supervision. The people are likely to be low on commitment. They will work steadily when the leader is present but will slacken when the leader is absent. This is much the Theory X leader. At a positive level this may be appropriate to crisis situations where the best shall command and people feel secure.\n\nPeople high, task low (1.9): This is more like a country club where the leader gives concern to people issues and sacrifices the task. Such leadership style is bound to fail because the tasks and objectives are not achieved. People can take advantage of the leader. At another level, a\n\n",

He concentrates on encouraging them to better results.\n\nPeople low, Task low (1.1): In a worst scenario this shows an impoverished situation where the leader abdicates his responsibility to people or the task. The leader is concerned with maintaining his leadership position and concentrates on external powers that can make this happen. The organisation is bound to decay and die. At a positive level, the leader is so confident that his team are mature and capable to achieve results on their own that he delegates the internal running of operations to them.\n\nMedium/people, Medium/task (5.5): This is the middle of the road where people and tasks are moderately balanced but not enough to bring outstanding results. Such leaders will get average performance only. A leader may adopt this style when he is new to the organisation and needs time to understand the task requirements and people.\n\nPeople High, task high (9.9): High priority is given to both people and task. The leader takes a participative approach through which he achieves high performance. The people are highly motivated  and  conflicts  are  low.  Quality  of  work  is  good  and  both  employee  and  customer satisfaction is achieved. This is claimed to be the ideal situation in which both the organisation and the people prosper.\n\nKieth Blanchard brought in another revolutionary study where he narrowed the 81 situations in the managerial grid to only four situations that leaders need to worry about. The situations are caused by what he called the maturity of the team or individual. Maturity was defined as the ability (or competence) and willingness (or motivation). He worked on the bi-dimensional grid and proposed four styles:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDirective Style: Is when the leader makes decisions with little input from employees who merely act on instructions. This style is used in situations where work is done by beginners like apprentices and trainees who are unable to do a job and unwilling to perform them because of their nervousness. They need close supervision and guidance.\n\nPersuasive Style: Is when the leader makes the decisions but at the same time encourages the individual or team to support his decision instead of forcing his decision on the team. The employees have low ability at this stage but are willing to perform tasks as the leader encourages them. The leader sets higher standards and gives the individual or team the confidence to perform.\n\nConsultative Style: Is when the individual or team is high in competence but unwilling. These are mature experienced groups who may not have the managerial qualities to reach leadership positions. They are normally old timers.\n\nThe leader would take them into confidence and consult with them on how to proceed in a situation. Their willingness to help improves because they are made part of the decisionmaking process.\n\nDelegative Style: Is  when  the  individual  or  team  has  high  competence  and  are  also  well motivated. They can be left to perform without supervision. These employees need broad directions and are empowered with decisionmaking authority. They are also given deadlines and milestones when work is reviewed.\n\nWhat do all these studies mean to the Executive Housekeeper? How can she interpret them into an effective leadership approach?\n\n",

In 1927 A.D, Hawthorne Works of Western Electric Company in Chicago hired Elton Mayo of Harvard Business School to provide a solution to a very demoralized work force. He created an informal test group who were subjected to various conditionslight, tea-breaks, working conditions etc. In spite of different conditions ranging from good to bad, this test group displayed incredible productivity.\n\nHe made a startling discovery that workers tended to cluster together into informal groups in order to fill a void in their lives (alienation) and this void resulted from a basic need for cooperation and comradeship which modern industrial organisations had ignored. Further, these informal groups could exert a far stronger pull on the workers motivation than the combined strength of money, discipline, and even job security itself. The test group were an informal group who decided to break all records!\n\nHe told  managers  and  supervisors  to  improve  communications  so  that  all  would  have  a sympathetic insight into the minds of each other and to put supervision into the hands of men to whom a respect for their fellowmen came naturally. Alienation was a demon and people needed the touch of humanness in a mechanistic world. Managers and supervisors were to be trained in the skills of listening, understanding and eliciting cooperationquite a departure from the classical\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimage of an iron boss. He also found that workers liked to participate in managing their own work which informal groups provided. This re-enforces the belief that motivation must come from within and not externally.

They concentrated on the behaviour and attitudes of frontline supervisors. They discovered that supervisors that led high performing groups were characterized as employee centred and those leading low performing groups were production centred (or task centred). Employee Centred supervisors were task oriented too but gave more emphasis to its workers. Their supervisory tactic was to give their people a general outline of how the work was to be accomplished leaving the details up to the workers themselves. They assumed that  their  people  were  responsible  enough and capable to get things done without someone peering  over  their  shoulders.  The  employees  were  in  control.  The  task  oriented  supervisor considered his main job was to get the work done and looked at his people as pure instruments. He interfered with all decisions and provided close supervision. The study showed that the emphasis on productivity at the expense the dignity of workers was self-defeating.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Abraham Maslow, a social scientist, brought the concept of human needs that changed the concept of motivation most dramatically by claiming that:\n\nNeeds are essential to human well-being. These could include those that are essential to human survival such as food, water, clothing and shelter at the basic level, to those that are essential for social survival like belonging and status.\n\nThis was lucidly displayed in the famous Maslows Need Hierarchy as shown on next page.\n\nMaslows Need Hierarchy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe needs start from the bottom and we shall examine how they impact on human beings.\n\nPhysiological Needs: These are the basic needs for survival such as food, water, clothing, shelter, air and sex (for procreation of the human species). The hotel industry recognizes this need and meets them by providing free duty meals that satisfies the need for food; uniforms for clothing needs; housing or an allowance for housing to meet the need for shelter; potable water in staff cafeterias; fresh air through climate control mechanismsfor example the kitchens and laundry which are very humid and hot especially in hot climates are provided with proper exhausts and fresh air supply; and a salary to start and propagate a family.\n\nSecurity Needs: When survival is no longer an ever present danger there is a tendency to become more concerned with preserving this good fortune. The security need is both physical and emotional. The employees want to be sure that the organisation they are working in is physically safe from anything that may endanger the body. Hotels provide locks, fire warning systems, sprinklers, fire-fighting equipment, etc. to satisfy this need of physical safety. Employees want to be warned of wet floors and know the name of callers before responding to a telephone. A welltrained security staff protects the safety of guests and employees.\n\nA workers need for emotional security comes in many ways. First is the need to be welcomed into the organisation and inducted well when they join; Then they want to know what is expected of them through job descriptions; they want to be treated with courtesy and respect; they want see that the property provides safe working conditions and safety training, especially in the use of equipment and carrying heavy loads. Grievance procedures, suggestion systems, performance evaluation are all organisational processes meant to give the employees emotional security.\n\nBelonging: Human beings are social animals. They prosper and grow when interacting with others. This behaviour was noticed right from the early caveman who lived together to form tribes. We have seen in the Hawthorne studies that in the absence of attention and loneliness people formed informal groups to provide that sense of belonging. Membership to a group was a powerful motivator. Employees are given identity cards to identify them with the organisation. Establishments take welfare measures and provide social clubs where employees can meet for sport or social meetings.\n\nStatus and Self-Esteem: While status is the way others perceive us, self-esteem is the way we perceive ourselves. Employees within the industry are given ranks, perquisites and uniforms to distinguish them within and without the organisation. Hotels do have a hierarchy that sets a chain of command. People can aspire for higher positions in the organisation to improve their status. Self-Esteem is a bit tricky. The first step towards is to give employee respect and dignity. Selfesteem is also given by bestowing authority and empowering employees. Suggestion Schemes also permit employees to participate in the progress of the organisation by acting on their views and ideas.\n\nSelf Actualisation: This is a state where human beings reach their potential and are able to control  and  contribute  to  the  environment.  This  is  the  main  motivator  of  the  modern  age. Organisations provide the conditions for people to attain their full potential through delegation; training and development; accountability; job rotation; challenging tasks; etc. Employees want to feel  that  they  have  a  say  in  the  prosperity  of  the  organisation.  Personal  growth  by  attaining mastery over ones environment is potentially the most powerful motivator of all because unlike other motivators it can never be satiated.\n\n",

      "content": "One of the most sophisticated studies on work motivation came from Fredrick Herzberg and his colleagues at the Psychological Service of Pittsburgh. It is for this reason the study is called Pittsburgh Studies. They studied a more sophisticated group of 200 engineers and accountants. They were asked to recall specific incidents in their recent experience which made them feel either  good or bad. They found that good feelings were felt in the nature of work that they performed rather than background factors like money, security or working conditions. This led the researchers to classify those that they called motivators and those that they called hygiene factors. A motivator had an uplifting effect on attitudes or performance whereas hygiene factors provided no improvements but those that prevented loss of morale and efficiency.\n\nThe hygiene factors were things like pay, security, working conditions, and supervisory style. These were dissatisfiers. When they were inadequate, they had a significant negative effect on worker attitudes, but they had no important positive effect when they were properly administered. This showed that these factors, especially pay, did not motivate.\n\nMotivators were satisfiers that left an uplifting impact such as recognition, growth, achievement, and challenge in the job. For this cadre of professionals, sustained motivation lay in assignments that pushed their capabilities to their limits.\n\n",

Those that believe in a similar thing will seek each other out with urgency. They go through an excited process of comparing notes, speculating about the event, and seeking explanations. They get relief in exchanging notes. Misery certainly does love company. The informal group was an antidote for dull working environments and oppressive bosses. Groups provide pride, importance and security to the individual.\n\nDavid C. McClelland from Harvard University led a group of psychologists on a research and discovered the achievement motive . They found that the achievement motive played a very vigorous role in the lives of people. This motive makes accomplishment an end in itself. People with this motive enjoy winning, in competing successfully with a difficult standard; this means more than money or recognition. The higher this motivation was in people, the higher was their rise in positions of greater power and responsibility.

The housekeeper should follow the steps below to enliven the MBO approach:\n\nStep 1: Decide the performance year: Earlier organisations coincided the performance year with the financial year. While some organisations follow January to December as there financial year, others follow April to March. The financial year also builds in budgetary provisions for the ensuing year. The problem of aligning the performance year to the financial year is that appraisals are done much after the financial year and miss the annual budget to put in the recommendations for increments and bonuses. Organisations altered this situation by delinking the two periods. So if the budgeting year was April to May they made the performance year January to March giving ample time for recommendations and rewards to be factored into the next years budget. Earlier appraisals were used solely for the purpose of giving out increments and bonuses. Now organisations use it also as a powerful developmental tool, where weaknesses are looked upon as a training opportunity.\n\n",

The housekeeper must always seek to measure performance. Measures dont lie and are accepted by both the assessor and assessee.\n\nStep 3: Set objectives and targets with the subordinate at the beginning of the performance year. Objectives must be realistic and measurable and follow the SMART principle discussed in Lesson 1.3. Some objectives that can be set for a room attendant are:\n\nMost important aspect of objective setting is that the employee must understand them and believe that they can be achieved. The housekeeper must listen to any doubts or apprehensions in achieving them. The objectives must be realistic and attainable.\n\nStep 4: Review performance mid-year. An employee likes to know how s/he is doing. Feedback is a strong motivator and the employee has time to correct his/her performance if there are any weaknesses. Sometimes objectives will need to be altered as situations change. For example, an unplanned convention booked can introduce a set of new performance objectives.\n\nStep 5 : Approach the system as a developmental tool. The housekeeper must be perceived as a mentor and coach. She must discuss weaknesses as opportunity for training. The employee may need inputs of knowledge, skills and attitudes which have different methodologies from the simple to the sophisticated. Such inputs become the individual development plan which dovetails into a larger departmental training and development plan.\n\nStep 6: Conduct an appraisal interview in a relaxed atmosphere and with an open exchange of ideas. Earlier, appraisals were down behind the back of the employee. Employees did not get an opportunity to express themselves, and received surprises at the time of increments and rewards. This closed door system is obsolete. An employee must be given an opportunity to discuss his/ her performance jointly and plan a way to overcome weaknesses if any. The employee must be given enough time to prepare for an interview. The interview must be held in a quiet and relaxed place and the housekeeper must guard against any distractions. It is an important time for the employee and s/he must get the full respect that the occasion demands. Strictly concentrate on the individuals performance and not the personality, unless the personality is essential to service such as grooming and hygiene.\n\nGive the subordinate an opportunity to explain himself or herself. Help the subordinate to identify deficiencies and chalk out action plans for improvement. Recognise and praise a job welldone. Show the subordinate the path for future growth. Encourage the employee to higher standards. Let the employee know the increment s/he will get for that performance and note\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndown any objections. Such objections can be discussed with the superior or the Human Resource Manager.\n\nStep 7 : Document an individual development plan that is acceptable to the employee and receive a joint signature of agreement. Include the individual development plan in the Department Training and Development Plan that goes to the training department that will advise or organise appropriate training programmes.\n\nStep 8: Send in writing the recommendations for rewards to the superior.\n\n",

It is a process of setting goals that are attainable and comparing them to the financial performance of a previous similar period. The key to successful budgeting is the planning process where long-term and short-term objectives are in place, supported by sound policies and procedures. A budget serves the following purposes:\n\nA budget is a management tool and not an accounting tool. However, it uses the accounting process established for a business. An understanding of accounting reports is essential to prepare a budget. The person making the budget must know the components of a profit and loss statement and how it is presented. It differs from pure accounting only by noting predictions while accounting records actual facts. The housekeeping budget must cover a period that is controllable. Most hotels prepare an annual budget as a reasonable period for control.\n\nThe question arises why do we budget? Budgeting is a management control function and improves the process of control. A budget works on the basis that business plans go according to the schedule. Unfortunately, this is not always so. Plans are influenced by unanticipated factors internally or externally. An employee strike can affect plans just as much as a new sales tax can have an impact on plans and budgets. Plans must include remedial steps for the times when things go out of control. Budgets have to be altered accordingly. Sometimes plans have to be altered due to deficiencies thrown up in the budgeting process. For example, a plan may include room renovations for a set of rooms but the budget reveals that present cash flows cannot afford the renovation costs due to predicted business trends.\n\n",

So if he has invested $20 million in the hotel project he may say that he wants a 15% return on that investment each year. That figure translates into $ 3 million a year. This contribution comes from all revenue departments. The return on investment was set in year one by the investor. This figure increases year by year to factor in the present value of the investment. Sometimes the investor is reasonable and takes the product life-cycle into account. He may lower his return on investment in the introductory stage of the property but get more aggressive in the growth stages and then ease out at the mature and decline stage.\n\nWorking backwards (see fig. 3.12) the accountant will add the prevalent income tax percentage. He will then add fixed charges like depreciation, insurance and interest on loans taken. The budget would then arrive at the gross operating profit (GOP). The GOP reflects the efficiency of the operations in controlling expenditure. It represents the operating costs to run the business. Hotels consider a 30% GOP as healthy. Each department is concerned with GOP as a measure of their performance while the accountant will be concerned with figures relating to tax, insurance, interest and depreciation. After all, the costs to run the business are added on, like salaries and wages, heat, light and power, stationery costs, etc. to arrive at the gross profit. This may vary based on the unique circumstances of the hotel. If we add the cost of goods derived from a historical percentage of direct costs like guest amenities, raw food materials, etc, we arrive at the desired  sales  figure.  The  rooms  division  sees  its  contribution  to  sales  as  a  ratio  to  food  and beverage sales. In large hotels, a healthy ratio of room sales to food and beverage sales is 50:50, and then the room contribution is 50% of the total sales desired.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "In Lesson 1.5 entitled, What is Management?, we have seen the role of the manager which reflects the role of the Executive Housekeeper. We have also seen the duties of the Executive Housekeeper in Lesson 3. The question arises whether supervisory skills are very different? The answer is, Most definitely, but somewhat related. Supervisors are the lowest rung of management but the critical link with the operational workers. Many organisations put them in an officer cadre which relies heavily on their technical skills but introduces them to human and conceptual skills. Most supervisors rise from the worker level, based on their technical achievements and potential for management. Figure 4.1 below gives an idea of the relationship of roles between managers and supervisors.\n\nFig. 4.1 Relationship of Roles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe diagram indicates three types of skills: conceptual, human and technical. These are common in varying degrees in all types of management and therein lies the relationship of supervision with management.\n\nConceptual skills: This relates to vision and ability to imagine and anticipate events and ideas. The top management has the major portion of this requirement for it is they who plan on a perspective and long term basis. They are expected to anticipate events and commit resources to meet them. Take, for example, renovation of rooms. The top management will visualise when it will happen, what funds will be required and the time by which it will be completed. Middle Management is given boundaries in which to conceive their operations and do annual planning. They can visualise till the extent of a year. The supervisors have to visualise too but on a weekly and daily basis. They should be able to anticipate events and emergencies on their daily routine and make tactical decisions to meet eventualities. Conceptualisation is not only to visualise but also comprehend. Top management are so qualified and experienced to comprehend a larger variety  of  subjects  and  issues  to  give  strategic  directions.  Middle  management  has  narrower spectrums  to  comprehend  based  on  their  experience  and  responsibilities.  Supervisors  must comprehend the instructions given to them by management.\n\nHuman Skills: This seems to be the largest chunk of skills required for both management and supervisors. To be a manager or supervisor means leading people to achieve given objectives. The supervisor is the first line of contact with the rest of the staff. S/he is the sandwich filling between the management and staff. The filling makes the sandwich meaningful! Besides this a supervisor has a number of other people to deal with on a daily basis. Figure 4.2 below gives an illustration of the people with whom a supervisor has to interact:\n\nFig. 4.2 The Supervisory Interface\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe see in the diagram above, that the supervisor has many interfaces. The floor supervisor, for example, is subordinate to management and receives objectives and instructions. Her relationship with her boss is critical. She has to have trusting relationship where she can clarify doubts or seek\n\nhelp freely. She bears the burden of the superiors expectations that all duties and responsibilities will  be  carried  to  standards.  The  supervisor  leads  and  motivates  her  team  (see  Lesson  3.6 Leadership and Motivation for more details). The team expects the supervisor to lead from the front and make tactical decisions at the operational level. The team also expects the leader to understand their individual competencies and skills and to put them together towards contributing to the team. They also want him or her to understand their limitations and problems and be a problem solver to help them through their handicaps. The supervisor deals with guests in handling complaints and needs and translating them into action. This requires guest handling skills (see the part, Understanding Guest Service in  Introduction for more details). Finally the supervisor deals with other departments and brings to the team their cooperation and coordination for the success of the operation. We know by now that housekeeping coordinates with maintenance, laundry, stores, and the front office on a daily basis. Periodically, they coordinate with other departments as well.\n\nTechnical Skills: Supervisors are expected to have the technical skills better than the team members. Workers like the comfort of going to the supervisor to resolve technical problems. Team members expect the supervisor to train and coach them on the job on various aspects of the job, as well as translate management policies, procedures and standards at the work place.\n\n",

      "title": "Supervisory Competencies",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "While the generic skills of a supervisor are given above, it is important to identify those specific skills and competencies that make him succeed:\n\nCommunicators: The supervisors are expected to communicate well both orally and in writing. This  is  because  they  are  constantly  interacting  with  management,  workers,  guests  and  other departments. They have to be persuasive yet empathetic and be good listeners. Supervisors are required to generate several reports at the operational level for management to make decisions. They are also required to give verbal feedback to the management. At the same time, they are required to communicate management policies, plans, and standards in a manner that is easily understood at the worker level.\n\nProblem Solvers and Decision makers: Supervisors are expected to solve problems at the operational level. They are hired to do exactly that and not let the operational issues bog the management down. This requires them to make tactical decisions within their boundaries of authority. This also requires them to achieve objectives with given resources which are always in short supply.\n\nLeaders: Supervisors are expected to lead. This means taking full responsibility of actions taken at the ground level. They are expected to be enthusiastic and encourage the team to achieve results in spite of heavy odds. They must see their team members as individuals with their talents and handicaps. They must improve on talents and help overcome handicaps. Team building is an important aspect of the supervisor who is expected to gel the varied talents and personalities as a cohesive whole. Workers expect the supervisor to be their friend, philosopher and guide and reliable to keep their confidences.\n\nSelfDisciplined: Workers look to the supervisor as a role model. This is a big expectation, which can only be fulfilled by being self-disciplined. Discipline for a  supervisor translates as being on time for duty; well-groomed; respecting seniors; following instructions; meeting deadlines; not\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshirking responsibilities; being polite and courteous; putting management before self; following rules and regulations; following standards; and leading from the front.\n\nContinuous improvement: Supervisors sometimes fall into the trap that they know it all. A good supervisor will continuously upgrade herself through self learning and see ways to bring the new knowledge into the workplace. They will encourage their team also to give feedback on how things can be done better. Management value suggestions for improvement from the grass root levels as well.\n\n",

The original is meant for the front office, the duplicate for the auditor who calculates expected revenues, and the triplicate for the housekeeping record. The Floor Supervisor may delegate this task to a room attendant. She then sends the report to the Housekeeping Control Desk Supervisor who prepares a consolidated list of all the floors. She sends it to the front office receptionist who tallies the consolidated report with the room rack. This procedure is followed as a check on unauthorised room occupancies or inadvertent mistakes in recording room occupancies.\n\nFig. 4.8 Occupancy Codes\n\nThe Housekeeping Room Report is basically a list of room numbers against which the Floor Supervisor indicates the occupancy status by prescribed occupancy codes (fig. 4.8). The codes may vary from hotel to hotel but the basic information and intention is the same. The Floor Supervisor physically enters each room on the floor with her master key following the entry procedure of knocking the door and announcing Housekeeping. This she does again after an interval of thirty seconds to give time to the occupant to open the door. Once in the room she ascertains the number of guests by three methods: 1) by noticing the number of beds used; 2) by seeing the number of bath towels used; and 3) by observing the types of guest clothes hung in the wardrobe. The first check normally confirms the occupancy. She will obviously not enter rooms with a Do-not-Disturb sign.\n\nAn explanation of the codes will be useful here:\n\nOccupied: This is a status that shows that a guest has checked into the room and is staying in the hotel. The signs of occupancy are beds that have been used, baggage on the baggage rack, clothes in the wardrobe, room service trays not cleared, bath towels that have been used and personal effects lying in the room and bathroom.\n\nVacant: This is evident when a room is ready for sale and has no guest belongings.\n\nDND: This is a sign displayed either by a door knob card or a lit DND light beside the door. Obviously the guest cannot be disturbed.\n\nLuggage in Room but not Used: This code may seem odd. There are guests who may lease a room but stay with friends and relatives in the city. The luggage is not opened. The danger of such a status is that the guest may have skipped without paying the room bill but leaving the baggage behind as a decoy.\n\nUnder Repair: This code indicates that the room been declared unsuitable for occupancy till the maintenance has corrected the fault in the room. This is a temporary situation where the room can be released in a short time.\n\nOccupied, but no Luggage: These rooms show that the beds and bath linen have been used in spite of no guest luggage; there are several possibilities in such rooms: (1) it is a departure\n\n",

This can be a potential skipper or a person who may depart without paying the bill.\n\nOut-of-Order: This  is  a  status  that  places  a  room  for  a  longer  period  of  maintenance  and therefore, cannot be expected to be on sale.\n\nDouble Lock: A hotel provides a double locking facility to guests as a security measure. The Floor Supervisors master key may not be able to open a door with a double lock.

The wardrobe is the prime storage space in the room for guest belongings and additional blankets and pillows. It would have a section to hang long clothes like dresses and gowns; shelves for extra pillows and blankets and drawers for clothing accessories. Most hotels that provide room safety boxes have them installed in the wardrobe for additional security. The wardrobe normally has a full length mirror for guests to use just as they leave the room. The guest will find the following amenities inside the wardrobe: laundry lists; bath slippers; shoeshine tag; hangers; bathrobe; extra pillows and blankets. Some wardrobes have internal lighting to see clearly the articles in the cupboard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe dresser is a multi-purpose piece of furniture. It has a base that acts as a dresser as well as the writing desk. Above it is mounted a mirror. The dresser has drawers where the guest will find guest stationery and sewing kits. On the top, the dresser will display menu cards, guest comment forms and other internal advertisement material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe room gets complete with a coffee table and two chairs . This is where magazines are displayed and where the guest can eat his meals ordered from the room service. It is the place where the guest can seat his/her visitors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe cannot overlook the fact that many hotels have balconies, terrace gardens and patios. They may provide garden furniture for these areas that can resist external temperatures. A room attendant will have to maintain them as well. Chalet type of structures may provide verandas that will have seating appropriate for outdoor purposes. With this feature, guests may want to eat their room service meals outdoors and enjoy the views and ambience that is provided.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Deluxe hotels may provide shower trays as well while economy hotels will do away with bath tubs due to space  restrictions  and  provide  shower  trays  instead.  Some  budget  hotels  may  just  provide  a\n\nshower with a shower curtain. At this point, it is important for the room attendant to know the difference in terms for bathing: a bath is when a bath tub is provided; a shower tray facility is when an enclosed cubicle is provided for showers; and a shower is an alcove where a person bathes with shower from a shower fountain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis completes the guest room.

This is possible only if the room is available to the front office agent to sell. Departure rooms are required to be cleaned for sale at the soonest possible time. The productivity standard ranges from 20 minutes to 40 minutes based on the size of rooms. It is the responsibility of the front desk to inform the housekeeping control desk the moment the room is released by the guest. The desk attendant must immediately inform the Floor Supervisor about such departures. Likewise, the Floor Supervisor must immediately inform the housekeeping control desk once the room is cleared for sale. There is immediacy about this crucial  communication  on  which  room  revenues  are  based.  The  front  desk  also  advises  the housekeeping control desk about group arrivals and crew arrivals. We have already read about the importance of such volume arrivals. The front desk also depends on the housekeeping for the Housekeeping Room Report in each shift.

These  are  consolidated  by  the  desk  control  attendant  who  forwards  the second and third copies of all requisitions to the Executive Housekeeper for approval. She will examine the requisitions and approve them or call the concerned supervisor for explanations if she is in doubt. We know by now that the Executive Housekeeper has to be careful when approving supplies as they cost and impact on her budget. Once approved the concerned supervisor is ready to withdraw the supplies from the general store. The General Store stocks items of daily consumption for the whole hotel. The store is manned by a qualified storekeeper and assisted by a helper to draw items from various shelves. Due to the heavy demand on the store, they allot days to each department for their respective withdrawals. On the allotted day, the housekeeping control  desk  attendant  will  inform  the  concerned  supervisor  to  come  personally  or  send  a representative from her department to withdraw their supplies from the store. The storekeeper verifies the approval of the Executive Housekeeper on each requisition before issuing the items. He will mention items that are out of stock on the requisition form for delivery on the next issue day. The storekeeper retains the second copy of the requisition form after receiving the signature of the person withdrawing items and returns the third copy with his signature to the withdrawer.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The Linen Room usually serves as the base of operations for most housekeeping departments. It is usually under the control of a supervisor who has the responsibilities to issue fresh linen and receive soiled linen. A linen room could have a dedicated linen store which keeps a stock of new linen  to  replenish  those  in  circulation  when  they  are  lost  or  damaged.  The  amount  of  linen maintained is based on the size of the property. Linen is very expensive and when one considers the amount of linen used for a hotel the investment is enormous. The amount of linen is based on the total number of linen required to equip all rooms and restaurants at one time. This is considered as linen in circulation. This par is multiplied keeping in mind the time to wash soiled linen. An inhouse laundry should take 24 hours to launder a set of linen while outsourced laundries may take 48 hours. Keeping this in mind progressive hotels will maintain a turnaround par stock of five:\n\nIt is quite normal to have a round of four. Anything less may pose a challenge to the housekeeper. Every hotel will have a policy regarding the change of bed linen. Deluxe properties may want to change used bed linen everyday. Economy properties may change linen every alternate day or every three days. In any case, a room cleared for sale to a new guest will always have fresh linen. The Floor Supervisor will ensure that the hotel policy is met. The challenge for the Linen Supervisor increases if the property uses different coloured linen for each restaurant outlet. Each colour will need its own par stocks. While it is prudent for all hotels to have white, interior design concepts may insist on coloured linen.\n\nLinen rooms are of two types: 1) centralised ones where all linen is controlled at a central point.  Such  linen  rooms  are  found  at  resorts  which  may  have  a  few  rooms  only  to  justify centralisation. 2) The other type of linen room operation is one which is decentralised where the main linen room feeds floor pantries which maintain linen par stocks to service a given number of\n\nFigure 7.1 gives a typical layout of a linen room. It will be observed that the linen room has only one entrance for security reasons. It adjoins the in-house laundry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrooms on the floor or a set of floors. This system is ideal for large buildings, especially high rise ones, which have several floors and covers a considerable distance from the linen room to justify decentralisation  to  encourage  productivity.  It  is  useful  for  expanded  resorts  that  have  chalets spread over large acreage that requires feeder linen rooms to reach the remote locales. The floor pantries are controlled by floor supervisors.\n\nFig. 7.1 Layout of a Linen Room\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

We must understand that a hotel is open to  resident    guests  and  the  local  public  that  visits  it. Hotels have always been the centre of social activity for the local populace and the number of people that they can attract, adds to the stature of the property, as well as  the  revenue  that  they  generate.  To  the  investors, each space accessible to the public is a potential revenue area  and  therefore,  they  like  to  exploit  it  to  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmaximum. Investors have dug below the ground to create space as well as used rooftops to make them money spinners. The larger the hotel, in terms of the number of rooms, the larger is the public area required. Larger number of arrivals and departures will require greater lobbies; larger swimming pool; more elevators; larger food and beverage facilities; etc.\n\n",

      "content": "The boundaries of public areas do not stop indoors. It extends to external areas too. There is the challenge of parking. If the hotel is frequented by local populace they will need large car parks. This can pose a problem in downtown locations where space is dear. Investors are forced to go underground to create multi-layered parking areas. The local building authorities also insist on a minimum ratio of empty space outside in relation to building space. This space translates into driveways; landscaped gardens; and utility areas. Then there is the huge responsibility of staff facilities. Hotel personnel need their own parking areas as well as entry and exit points. Purchase and Receiving departments need their own aprons for supplier trucks. There could well be a\n\nsteady stream of these trucks throughout the day when one considers the number of items required by the hotel.\n\nIn remote places such as resorts that do not have welldeveloped local towns to house their employees, hotels will be forced to have captive staff accommodation, especially when qualified personnel are imported. For example, it is mandatory for hotels in the Gulf States to provide staff accommodation since all the staff is hired from other parts of the world. Hotels in these countries have massive staff complexes that not only provide accommodation but also dining halls, recreation centres, staff laundries, drug stores, etc.\n\nThe complexity of hotel public areas increases if the hotel has its own private beach or independent chalets spread over large acreages. All surfaces have their own unique properties that need technical understanding to maintainthe roads  and car parks are made of tar; beaches of sand; pathways of stones; landscapes, golf courses,  tennis  courts  have  lawns;  swimming  pools, waterfalls,  rockeries  and  fountains  have  their  own cleaning challenges due to the presence of water; and hotel facades that are becoming more difficult to clean and  manage  as  the  architecture  is  getting  more complex.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

The hotel could have a lower lobby that accesses the revenue areas like the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhealth club, upper car parks and restaurants. Discotheques and speciality restaurants could be positioned here. This is also the ideal spot for indoor recreation like squash courts, gymnasiums and swimming pools. Externally, a hotel would have the main landscapes with walkways leading to beaches and water sports. It is ideal for a lower level of shopping arcade.\n\nLobby Level: The entrance to the hotel is a floor up. It is here that the main reception and lobby is located. Many restaurants could lead the residents and local public to different places off the lobby. Of the restaurants, the coffee shop and the dining room are a must. Most groups would eat here, so the design permits easy access to these places through the lobby and not through the floors. The back office of the front office will be in the lobby as also the left  luggage  rooms,  security  deposit  rooms  and  telecommunications.  The shopping arcade extends off the lobby.

Shopping\n\n<!-- image -->\n\narcades will also have the travel agency; beauty salons; barber shops; money exchange; bank; post office; drug store; etc. This level could also have the accesses to the banquet halls and meeting rooms. These places assume importance because of the volume traffic that arrives during a short period. Meeting and function rooms are busy throughout the day for corporate functions while the night is busy for social functions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMezzanine Floor: This is where the executive offices of the General Manager, sales and marketing, accounts, food and beverage manager, etc are located.

      "content": "Vacuum cleaners are the greatest friends of housekeeping cleaning staff. They come with nozzles and attachments for all types of surfaces. They are handy equipment for daily maintenance and find their way onto maid carts. Vacuum cleaners are recommended where there is a large amount of carpeted area in the hotel. There are many types of vacuum cleaners. The upright models work on a combined suction and beating process; and the floor modelscylindrical or spherical operate solely on suction. There are many kinds of upright vacuum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncleaners. The beater-bars vacuums agitate carpet piles and loosen dirt; brush vacuums agitate carpets glued to the floor; pile lifter vacuums have a strong suction capacity and a separate brush motor that restores crushed carpet piles. There are canister models with tanks that are mounted on castors and some that are held on the operators back. Canister models are preferred to reach difficult corners and edges. The value of the vacuum cleaner comes from the fact that it is quicker, requies less labour and raises no dust thus preventing dust from being deposited elsewhere in the room. When using the vacuum cleaner it must be checked for its functionality. When using it over carpets it should be done crossways over the carpet to ensure that suction has time to draw out the dust and the grit. A regular movement is most effective and can be judged by feeling the pull against the carpet. The wire connecting the power socket should be straight as the coiling of wire could lead to unmanageable knots which may even fall under the suction. Small objects such as pins and needles that are sharp should be picked by hand otherwise the nozzle or suction tube could get damaged and the effectiveness of the suction could reduce. The dust bags of the vacuum cleaner must be cleaned daily or more depending upon the frequency of its usage. A vacuum cleaner with an empty bag provides greater suction than the one whose bag is full of dust. The bag may be emptied out into a newspaper or paper sack and kept with the rubbish. All brush attachments should be kept free from dust, bits of cotton and hair that are picked up in the course of cleaning.\n\nA dustette is a small, light vacuum cleaner used for cleaning curtains, upholstery and mattresses. It cleans by brush and suction and is very easy to handle.\n\nWet Vacuums: This is a kind of vacuum that can suck water from floors or can have both suction and water sprayer to rinse the soiled area. Squeegee attachments on wet vacuums can make floor clean-up, stripping and scrubbing more efficient. Conventional vacuum cleaners must never be used to clean wet floors.  Wet vacuums come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some canister models can be dragged on castors while others can be strapped on the back of the cleaner. These vacuums have collection tanks that store the water that has\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbeen sucked up from the floors. This equipment can be used on wet carpets as well. Some wet vacuums may be pushed like a cart and are heavier for large water suction needs off floors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWet Extractors: While  wet  vacuum  cleaners  have  a  suction  feature,  wet extractors  have  suction  and  water  injection  features.  With  this  they simultaneously rinse and suck water from the surface. They are best for both carpets and floors. The basic principle of operation is that the extractor sprays water and detergent onto the surface and then uses suction to extract the water into tanks built into the wet extractor. Some machines have agitators to loosen the dirt from the carpet before spraying. They have other attachments for draperies and upholstery as well. Wet extractors come in various shapes and sizes. They come in lighter portable tank versions, as well as the heavy\n\nduty push-cart variety. They can be used for both floors and carpets. Some extractors can also have a feature for dry pick-up like normal vacuum cleaners.\n\nRotary Floor Machines: Rotary machines have several applications: to shampoo, polish and scrub. They can be used for both carpets and floors just by the change of an attachment. For example, the machine can be used for carpets by changing the bonnet block to bonnet brush.\n\n",

Mechanical scrubbers are used on large uncarpeted floors after they have been washed with water and detergent. Scrubbers are used to clean any sticky grit on the floors. Mechanical polishers are used on large polished wood or vinyl floor surfaces. The floor must be swept clear of dust and mud marks. Polish is lightly rubbed onto the floor surface for the best results.\n\nThe machine has a feed-in tray for detergent solutions and tanks for water supply and water extraction.

      "title": "Floors",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Floors in this section refer to those other than carpets, which will be discussed in detail in a later section. Floors have their advantages and disadvantages. They are more durable, sanitary and do not create static electricity. They are ideal where one can expect heavy traffic of people, equipment and vehicles. They are less vulnerable to moisture and do not breed micro organisms like carpets do. They are, therefore, preferred in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmoisture prone areas like bathrooms, kitchens and laundries. However, their disadvantages are many. They are nosier and cannot be used where one expects sound absorption like guest rooms or meeting rooms. Wet surfaces can be slippery and therefore, a hazard to guests and personnel. It may appear that they are easier to maintain than carpets. This is not so. They require constant mopping, sweeping and occasionally buffing and waxing.\n\nBasically, there are three types of floors:\n\nHard Floors\n\nWood Floors\n\nResilient Floors\n\nHard Floors are made from stone or clay. They include concrete, marble, granite, terrazzo, ceramic tiles and natural stone. They are the most durable of all floors. Hotels will use concrete in drive ways, porches, car parks, stewarding, laundry, etc where heavy traffic is expected. Marble,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nterrazzo and granite come in many colours and give a grand finish to surfaces. They are, therefore, preferred for counter tops, decorative walls, and select lobby floors. They come in glossy finish or mat finish to suit the décor style. They do not care to retain their gloss. They are, however, expensive as they  have  to  be  quarried  and  finished  in  size  and  face,  for commercial use. Terrazzo is made from small chips of marble\n\nand bound together to give an attractive look. Ceramic tile is made from a combination of marble, clay, slate, glass or flint. It is very durable and easy to maintain. Slate comprises the natural stone and comes in slices. It is used for roofing and heavy flooring.\n\nWood floors are differentiated between hard woods and soft woods. Teak, ebony, and maple are hard woods that are very expensive. They are used for furniture mostly and for exclusive floors. Oak wood is cheaper and therefore, chosen for wooden flooring. Soft woods such as pine and cork are used where a springy tread is preferred; but they create dents and scratches. Other variants of wood flooring are parquets floors that are wood tiles of maple and oak usually. Wood\n\nblocks resemble butcher cutting blocks but come in tiles. They are used where heavy wear and tear is expected. Wooden planks come in varying sizes and can be used for flooring. The chopping of wood has been controlled in many states because of fears of deforestation and therefore, it is difficult to get wood for large scale use. Care must be taken to purchase them from legitimate sources. Wood flooring is, therefore, used only for decorative purposes as in bars and lounges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResilient floors are  springy  and  therefore,  used  extensively.  They  include vinyl, asphalt, rubber and linoleum. Vinyl surfaces can be protected with wax for heavy use and therefore, used extensively. Since they are non-porous and sound absorbent, they are the preferred flooring. Vinayl floors come in many\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncolours.  Asphalt  flooring  is  resistant  to  decay  and mildew and is fire resistant. They are used on driveways and  rooftops.  Rubber  flooring  is  used  in  areas  that require sound absorption. They act as good underlay to conference halls and restaurants. Rubber is, however,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpensive  and  since  they  are  susceptible  to  fire  they  are  least  used. Linoleum flooring is the most popular in this category. Linoleum floors are cheap in cost and come in many colours. Linoleum is made from linseed oil, ground cork or wood, mineral fillers and resins. They may have a felt backing for extra spring. While linoleum is easy to maintain, it  cannot  take  heavy  traffic  and  wears  easily.  It  is  not  used  in  luxury settings.\n\nThe chart below gives the cleaning methods employed for each type of surface:\n\n",

There are alternatives nowadays\n\nin glass, metal, plastic and other materials shown in the chart below. Most hotels opt for wooden furniture that last longer than any other type.

      "content": "Nowadays, there is a variety of ceiling and wall surface finishes. They include wood, carpet, wall paper, fabric, stone, marble, granite, ceramic tiles and the most commonpaint. Wood comes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the form of plyboard for partitions and wood panels. This is used for offices, function rooms and wood specific log chalets. Wood gives a cosy and exclusive ambience. Their upkeep is done by polishing the wood; applying varnish when stains arise; or just by plain dusting with a cloth or feather duster. Luxury hotels have gone extensively into stone, granite and marble wall finishes especially for exterior surfaces and lobbies. They are more durable and give a rich look to a  property.  They  can  be  washed,  mopped  and  scrubbed  to  maintain  the\n\nfreshness. Ceramic tiles are extensively used in bathrooms, kitchens, receiving areas, laundries and pool sides. They are most effective where surfaces are exposed to water. Tiles can be washed with soap solutions and mopped dry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nas the cheapest and most durable surface finish. Painted surfaces can be touched up or re-painted\n\nWe will find wall paper in smaller traditional properties especially the bed and breakfast variety. They come in many designs and colours. Wall paper can be dusted daily with a feather duster. They have the danger of staining or guests leaving dirty imprints. Wall paper in rooms in busy hotels will require constant changing. The challenge is whether the particular design is available all the time or not. Paint by far is the most popular surface finish. With the advance of technology, there are paints to suit every kind of environment and budget. There is the plastic emulsion paint that can be washed easily and is resistant to wind, air and dust. Most guest rooms and public areas are painted whenever the need arises.\n\nVinyl manufacturers have introduced revolutionary ceiling and wall finishes. They come in attractive colours and designs. They are a viable alternative to paint. The product is made by laminating vinyl to  a  cotton  or  polycotton  backing.  Polycotton  backing  is  less flammable  and  more  durable  than  cotton;  it  is,  therefore,  most preferred. Vinyl comes in rolls and pasted onto the wall with a special adhesive.  It  is  mounted  on  ceilings  and  walls  by  specialists.  The challenge to housekeepers is the growth of mildew in wet climates. Mildew loosens the vinyl from the adhesive creating ripples in the vinyl. Vinyl can be scrubbed with brushes and soap solutions and even stronger detergents. The manufacturers are the best to suggest\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe appropriate cleaning agent for the particular vinyl chosen. Fabric surfaces naturally are the most luxurious looking but they are difficult to install, hard to maintain and easily damaged. They are also very expensive. Fabric surface finishes come in cotton, wool and silks. Sometimes two or more materials are combined to give it a unique appearance. Fabric wall coverings may be paper or acrylic backed. Acrylic backed fabric backing is preferred as it wrinkles less and easier to install. Fabric surfaces are vacuumed regularly and stains and spots removed by conventional methods used on fabrics.\n\nBasic principles of cleaning ceilings and walls are:\n\n",

Today there are reliable glass cleaning detergents  found  in  the  supermarket  that  can  be  sprayed  and cleaned  with  hand  held  squeegees.  Exterior  cleaning  of  glaze windows is a specialist job often given to contractors. It involves suspending carriages from the roof by cables for cleaners to access the windows from the outside. It is a hazardous job and the specialists know the precautions required for a safe operation.\n\nWindows are incomplete without the shades to give privacy and protect interiors from sunlight. Window shades come in different materials including vinyl blinds to fabric curtains. Window coverings attract dust and pollutants like cigarette smoke. Vinyl blinds must be dusted daily with a feather duster. They can also be washed with soap solutions. Vinyl blinds are used in offices and low cost guest rooms. Drapes are preferred in hotels because they are sound absorbent and give a luxurious look. Drapes can be cleaned with special drape vacuum cleaners. All curtains in the hotel must be listed for period dry-cleaning and washing. This poses a challenge for the housekeeper as she has to make that area unavailable for use. If the area is revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngenerating, like guest rooms, food outlets and function rooms, the task gets more critical. The housekeeper will either have a spare set to hang or choose those lean times in a week or year to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nclose  down those areas for spring cleaning. The housekeeper must make sure at the time of purchase that the window fabrics can be maintained easily and inexpensively. Some fabrics do not respond well to washing, spotting or vacuuming.  These  need  to  be  tested  before  they  are  subjected  to  such treatment. Drapes can fade, lose colour, or shrink. The best fabrics chosen for hotels are those that can be washed. Nowadays windows are lined with cotton fabric to save them from exposure to sunlight resulting in the fabric becoming brittle or losing colour. Linings must be pre-shrunk before they are sewn onto curtains. It is prudent to dry clean such curtains to prevent further shrinkage.\n\nThe manner in which windows are hung or opened poses a problem to housekeepers. They are either hung on curtain rings along curtain rods or by curtain hooks that move along channels. Daily cleaners need to check that these are secure and send a maintenance request for defective ones. A window shade that cannot open prevents daily guest room cleaning that requires the room attendant to open it for airing the room.\n\nUpmarket hotels  also  provide  sheer  curtains  as  a  back-up  to  heavy curtains. These curtains are meant to let the sunlight in during the day, while heavy drapery is drawn for the night, mainly to give privacy to the room occupants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "Carpets serve many purposes: (a) They give the area a plush look; (b) they are sound absorbent and so ideal for guest rooms, meeting rooms and offices; (c) they keep rooms warm and are valuable in cold climates; and (d) They prevent slipping and therefore, are preferred in corridors and stairs apart from rooms.\n\nPrimarily carpets have three considerations: the pile, the material it is mounted on and the base that supports the woven structure.\n\nThe pile is the main finish of the carpet which gives the carpet its distinction and also determines the type of carpet. It is the surface which is visible and what we walk on. The carpets pile is judged by its density (how close the fibres are knitted); height of the pile (how thick the pile is); twist (the strength of each pile fibre) and weave of the pile (how it is knitted together). This determines its durability, look and maintenance standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHeight of the pile indicates the luxury of the carpet. The greater the height of the pile, the more plush it will look.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe density of the carpet gives its durability. Carpets with good density are less likely to be crushed under foot pressure. A good density of the carpets prevents soil and stains from lodging deep inside the pile by retaining them on the surface. The density is determined by seeing the back of the carpet and ascertaining the tightness with which the fibres are knitted together. The more closer the knitting, the denser is the pile. Another way to check density is to determine the weight of pile per square yard of carpet. The greater the weight, the more durable is the carpet.\n\nThe twist of fibres determines the quality of the carpet. The tighter the twist, the more resilient the carpet will be.\n\nThe weave is determined by how the fibres are mounted on the primary surface. This surface can be jute or synthetic material such as polypropylene. Jute backings are durable but catch mildew under damp conditions. Polypropylene has the same properties as jute but is mildew resistant. The primary backing is laced below with a bonding material such as rubber, latex or plastic that prevents the knots of the fibres from getting loose in transportation and installation.\n\nBasically there are four categories of carpets:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nterms of cleaning, they are picky, therefore, strong detergents like ammonia, salts, alkaline soaps and chlorine bleach must be avoided.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwell. They can be dyed well into other colours. They absorb sound. In terms of cleaning, they are resistant to stains and soil than wool. They resist micro organisms and therefore, can be treated for moulds, mildew, bacteria, etc. Synthetic category of carpets include nylon, which cleans easily and is less expensive; acrylic, which may look like wool but is less easy to clean and less resilient; polypropylene, which is more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsturdy and resistant to strong cleaning solutions, however wears easily; polyesters that look like wool and are durable, clean easily and come in endless rolls and therefore, have the advantage of being fitted to any room size, however, they wear easily; Acetate, which is a cost-effective silky fibre that fast in colour and resistant  to mildew, but wears easily and can get damaged with strong detergents; and Rayon, which has poor resistance to soil and abrasion but has colour retention and resistance to mildew.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "The main objective of carpet cleaning is to give carpets a long life. Since this one item is so expensive, it is treated as an asset that deserves a special care. Housekeepers are advised to have an annual carpet maintenance programme. Such a programme will have the following elements:\n\nin the last 24 hours. The spots and stains must be attended to immediately so that they do not become permanent.\n\nCarpet cleaning is done by several methods:\n\nDry Vacuuming Method: The vacuum cleaner is the main machine in this category. It has the advantage of sucking dust from between piles. It also lifts piles, levels them in one movement, and removes dust completely. Some modern vacuum cleaners have a combination floor nozzle that give the advantage of cleaning floors as well as carpets at the drop of a switch. Whenever one uses the nozzle for carpets, he has to move against the pile first and then along the pile  to  remove  hidden soil  lodged  inside  the  carpet  piles.  Use  smooth  brisk movements with downward pressure for smoothening and positioning the piles. Care must be taken to empty out the vacuum cleaner dust bag every time the cleaning  of  a  few  rooms  is  completed  to  avoid  dust  congestion  in  the  bag. Congestion stops the suction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHot Water Extraction: Hot water extraction is sometimes referred to as steam cleaning. Actually this is a misnomer as real steam on carpets is too dry and hot to clean the carpet properly. In this method, hot cleaning solution is sprayed under pressure onto the carpet and is immediately extracted with a vacuum source. The dirty solution is collected in a recovery tank and is flushed into the waste water system of the hotel. The advantage of this method is that it has the ability to flush large amounts of contaminants out of the carpet. It is the most preferred method and has the deepest cleaning action most suited to carpets with thick piles.\n\nShampooing: This method involves wetting the carpet and shampooing it. The equipment used is a motorized circular brush that injects cleaning solution at pressure into carpets that loosens and seeks the dirt out. The resultant dirt solution may be sucked from the surface. This method relies on vacuuming after the shampoo dries. This method is quick but does not clean all the dirt lodged deep inside piles. It is, therefore, not recommended for thick piled carpets. This method provides very good agitation and is best suited for low commercial carpets or low cut pile carpets that are highly soiled.\n\n",

      "content": "Bonnet Method (Dry Cleaning): This method is another wet cleaning method with a difference. It injects the cleaning solution mist into the carpet in the form of a spray and allows the carpet to soak the solution for a short while. It is then buffed with a rotary machine with absorbent pad that agitates the surface of the pile. Pads are made of synthetic or natural fibres and can be laundered and reused. The method has the advantage of drying very quickly because of the small amount of moisture used. It generally does a good job of cleaning of the top one third of the carpet visible to the naked eye. But it does very little to the grit and sand lodged deep in the pile that damage the carpet over time. Because there is no flushing action or extraction, there is very little deep cleaning involved. This method may be considered as an interim cleaning between more effective cleanings.\n\nDry  Foam  Method: This  method  is  very  similar  to  shampooing  in  that  it  relies  on  the aggressiveness of the brushing action, which is done by counter rotating cylindrical brushes. The method uses a high foam shampoo detergent with less liquid. It is applied by a rotary machine with a brush that suspends soils and emulsifies oils. The resultant liquid on the carpet is sucked out by a wet vacuum cleaner. Like shampooing it is not a suitable method for thick pile carpets.\n\nManual Method: This is a method using the carpet brush and dust pan. It is recommended to brush against the piles to make stand. This gives a springy feeling when one treads on the carpet. Use brisk movements between piles to scoop out dust. Collect the dust in dustpans and empty it in garbage bags after cleaning the carpets in every room. Carpet brushing is preferred to noisy vacuum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncleaners to avoid disturbance to sleeping guests especially in the night and early mornings.\n\nDry Powder Cleaning Method: In this method dry powder or crystals are sprinkled on the carpet and worked into the pile with a hand brush. The powder absorbs soils and is later removed by vacuuming the carpet surface. This method is ideal for high traffic areas that cannot be obstructed for long periods of time.\n\n",

Precaution must be taken to change dirty water with fresh water because it could leave a film of dirt instead of removing it. Warm water dissolves soap more readily than cold water; hence it must be used to remove dirty soap lather.  Water is of two types, hard water and soft water. Soft water is best for cleaning. Hardness in water is caused by the presence of mineral salts  mostly calcium (Ca) and magnesium (mg), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). The mineral salts react with soap to form an insoluble precipitate known as soap film or scum. The result is that the soap film does not rinse away easily. It tends to remain behind and produces visible deposits on clothing making it stiff. It attaches to the insides of bathtubs and sinks. Caution must be taken that the water is soft as no detergent is effective with hard water. Moreover, hard water does not wet the surface well as a precondition for good cleaning action.\n\n",

Liquid cleaning agents can either be diluted in a little water or used directly with a dry cloth.\n\nAmmonia is an alkali made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen. It is highly soluble and forms a solution called ammonium hydroxide (liquid ammonia). It is not too active when dry, but reacts with many chemicals in liquid form. It softens hard water and emulsifies grease.\n\nMethylated spirits are derived from methanol, a type of alcohol used for industrial purposes. It is also called methyl alcohol or wood alcohol. It is flammable and highly poisonous.  It has to be handled with extreme care. It reacts with various substances and is effective against grease stains.\n\nParaffin is a white, partly clear, waxy solid that has no odour or taste. Paraffin forms a moisture proof film on surfaces.  It is also grease solvent.\n\nTurpentine is a colourless with a strong odour. It is highly inflammable. It is used as a thinner for paints and varnishes. As a cleaning agent, it is grease and paint solvent which means that it ideal for removing paint and grease stains.\n\nVinegar is a sour liquid derived from wine-making. The French call it sour wine . While vinegars use  in  food  preservation  and  salads  is  wellknown,  its  commercial  use  has  found  its  way  to housekeeping cleaning chores.

Insecticides are used in hotels to control such pests as ants, flies, moths, cockroaches and termites.\n\nHerbicides: These chemicals are used to control weeds or other unwanted plants. Herbicides are used by hotel gardeners to reduce weeds, crab grass and dandelions among their plants. Herbicides are also used in recreational areas like gardens, ponds and lakes.\n\nFungicides: Certain fungus are pathogenic (disease causing) and may infect plants, animals and human beings. Fungicides are sprayed or dusted to kill fungal growths like rusts, mildew, smuts and molds. Fabrics are treated with fungicides to prevent rotting. Most disinfectants used in hotels use fungicides.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRodenticides: these chemicals are used chiefly in areas infested with rats and other rodents which are a health hazard.  Rats carry diseases such as rabies, rat bite fever,  tularemia and typhus. Rats also destroy food and grain in hotel dry stores. Rodenticides help in eliminating such pests in prone areas of the hotel like kitchens and stores.\n\n",

They cause little or no harm to other organisms. However, non-selective pesticides can harmor even killorganisms that are not considered pests. Non-selective pesticides should be used only when no other method of control is available.\n\nOver time certain pests like rats and mosquitoes have developed a resistance to pesticides. Manufacturers are producing new chemicals and methods to control them. For example, cockroach eradicators know the exact point where\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncockroaches breed and are able to apply sprays and pastes at those points to get rid of them. No longer does a hotel have to cover the entire area in a pest control programme.\n\nThe most effective and safe method of executing a pest control programme is by employing well-qualified professional exterminators on a contract basis. However pest control contractors cannot be expected to maintain the premises absolutely insect-free without the supplemental support and assistance of hotel personnel. For this reason, it is recommended that all maids should carry insecticide sprays on their carts and use them routinely when cleaning guest rooms and terraces. Recommended insecticides are harmless to human beings and animals, but it should be kept away from food stuff. These insecticides do not have a residual life and are, therefore, effective against a great many crawling insects, cockroaches in particular, on direct contact.\n\nThe residual insecticides necessary for a successful campaign against these insects are relatively toxic and must be handled with great care. It is recommended that they must be used only by professional  exterminators  unless  the  hotel  has  in  its  employment  an  individual  who  can  be trained in their use. They must also be stored in special areas away from human contact and food.\n\nCleanliness and constant vigilance, particularly in handling food, refuse and garbage is the best defense against rodents. All containers of these items should be clean and tightly covered and should be in metal. Wire enclosures should be used for dry food stuff in cartons and bags. This procedure plus periodic campaigns by the contract exterminators should keep the hotel free of rats and mice.\n\n",

The inner drum carries the fabrics while the outer drum does the extraction function. The perforation helps in extracting the excess water from the clothes. Care must be taken that perforations are away to prevent damage to the fabrics. The perforations also feed water and detergent into the drum. The drum carries the fabrics and rotates at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nspeed to enable detergents to agitate the fabrics and dislodge the soil from them. The amount of detergent added must be just right to have the best results. Today, there are automated washing machines that feed and control the water and detergents electronically. Water too has to be fed at temperatures suitable for the wash. Electronic equipment determines the right temperatures. The washer man then has many options of water flow, temperatures and detergent feed for different types of cleaning cycles. Automatic washing machines also have rinsing facility that rinses out excess water. They also have driers that prepare fabrics with the right moisture content for pressing. Industrial washing machines must be kept busy as idle time costs as well as reduces the life of the machine.\n\n",

      "content": "The relationship between housekeeping and Laundry is very significant for the smooth functioning of housekeeping services. The importance of laundry is inevitable as it processes soiled linen and uniforms and supplies housekeeping with clean stocks on a daily basis to keep hotel services running. It is, therefore, important for housekeeping personnel to know something of the operations of the laundry to fully understand its importance and contribution. The diagram below gives the reader an understanding of the laundry process flow:\n\nFig. 10.3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGuest Cycle\n\nLet us take each step at a time in the process above:\n\nGuest Calls: The process is initiated by the guest who has a desire to get his clothes washed, dried, cleaned or pressed. She takes the laundry list from the wardrobe and chooses the appropriate one (there are two lists one for washing and the other for dry cleaning and pressing). She fills the column Guest Count mentioning the number of each item and the expected cost of each set of items. She puts the soiled garments and laundry list in a laundry bag found in the wardrobe of the room. She calls for valet service by dialing the extension number found in the house service directory.\n\nLaundry Desk Attendant: Receives the call and notes the name of the guest and room number. He alerts the valet.\n\nValet: The valet is the term given in hotels for those who collect and deliver laundry from guest rooms. He proceeds to the guest room and after announcing himself as per procedure. He then tallies the guest count with his own physical count and notes the numbers in the column House Count. He makes sure that the laundry list has the guests name, room number, date, urgency of service and his/her signature.\n\n",

      "content": "Sorter/Marker: The valet hands over the laundry bag to the sorter/marker who checks the clothes for spots and stains before it is sent for washing or dry- cleaning. He does not want those spots and stains to spread or become permanent in the laundering process. He first labels the garment with indelible ink to identify them in future processes.\n\nSpotter: The spotter is a specialist who removes spots and stains. The spotter will return the garment to the sorter/marker who then sorts the garment by its texture and colour. He then sends it to the Washerman/ Dry Cleaner or Pressman for their necessary attention.\n\nWasher man or Dry Cleaner: They will sort the garments and put them in similar batches. They will load the washing machine or dry cleaning machine for washing or dry cleaning and follow procedures. While the washer man uses water as the medium of cleaning, the dry cleaner will use a dry cleaning solvent. Washed garments contain water twice their weight. The water  is  squeezed  out  in hydro-extractors .  The  clothes  are  removed  when  the  cloth  has approximately 25% water left. This is recommended for effective ironing.\n\nPressman: After  washing  or  dry  cleaning  the  garments  go  for  pressing.  There  are  various presses that serve different purposes. Hot-head presses have two surfaces one iron hot and the other padded for semiwet garments. Steam presses adopt the same principle as the hot head press except that the top surface has perforations through which steam passes. This is used for clothes that are wrinkled and need steam to iron them out. Shirt presses are special presses to give mens shirts their proper contours and creases  especially sleeves, shoulders and collars. Hand presses are like domestic presses used for light garments. Laundries can have heavy duty hand presses for stubborn creases and materials.\n\nPackers: Once the laundering process is completed the garments are sent in batches to the packer who tallies the garment labels with their respective laundry lists. He then proceeds to pack them as per procedure or hang them on hangers as requested by the guest.\n\nValet: The valet is handed over the packed garments with the original laundry list stapled onto the package. The valet proceeds to the desk attendant to raise an invoice.\n\nDesk Attendant: He checks the package and contents with the laundry list and creates an invoice which is often a tear away slip at the end of the laundry list.\n\nGuest: the valet proceeds to the guest room to deliver the laundry to the guest. At the room, he receives the guests signature to hand over to the front office cashier to post in the guests room account. Generally, cash is not encouraged as payment in the room but outsourced laundries may do so as they have separate billing processes.\n\n",

The soiled linen and uniforms are sent to the laundry following certain procedures (see Lesson 7 The Linen and Uniform Room).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFloor Linen: The floor linen is sent directly by chutes from floor pantries or deposited manually in linen hampers by the floor personnel. The linen is counted at the laundry floor by both the floor representative and laundry representative. To facilitate easy flow, each floor is given certain times to send their linen to the laundry. Going by this schedule, they can both plan their work accordingly.\n\nWashing & Dry cleaning: The piles of linen and uniform are sorted by the washer man and dry cleaner and placed in batches matching the fabric texture and colour. At this point, it is significant to have some additional knowledge of washing processes.\n\n",

It, therefore, becomes slightly acidic in nature. The acid rain may dissolve some minerals from the earth. Water from springs and wells carry many compounds dissolved in it.\n\nThe most important impurities in water from the laundering point of view are the compounds of calcium and magnesium and in certain cases, iron.\n\nWhen soap is added to hard water, the calcium and magnesium compounds react with soap to form insoluble lime soaps which are precipitated in the form of a sticky paste that traps dirt and re-deposits it on the fabric. Therefore, instead of becoming white, fabrics become dull and grayish.\n\nThe hardness of water (power to kill the soap) again can be divided into two parts:\n\nTemporary hardness (bicarbonates  of  calcium  and  magnesium)  which  can  be  removed  by chemical treatment known as water softening\n\nPermanent hardness (sulphates  of  calcium  and  magnesium)  can  be  removed  by  chemical treatment known as water softening.\n\n",

The pH scale has fourteen main divisions from 1-14. Pure water has a pH value of 7 and is a natural point.\n\nAn alkaline solution has a pH value more than 7; the farthest from 7, the stronger will be the alkaline solution. A solution which is acidic has a pH value below 7. The farther away in the value from 7, the more acidic will be the solution. The pH value denotes the nature of alkali and not the amount of alkali present in the solution.\n\nA strong alkali can only be used on cotton where as a mild alkali on wool and silk.\n\nThe following is the list of alkalis used in the laundry: a) sodium metasilicate b) trisedium phosphate also known as soda ash and sodium carbonate and c) sodium silicate also known as water glass and borax. Sodium metasilicate is preferred in laundering where the hardness of water is not more than 4 degrees otherwise soda ash recommended.\n\nA 0.2% solution of metasilicate has the right amount of active alkalinity to convert the acid soap to soap, rapidly and effectively. Active alkalinity is measured according to the pH scale. A 0.2% solution of metasilicate has pH value of 11.2.\n\nAlso sodium metasilicate does not set stains and thereby has the power to suspend dirt.\n\n",

The first soaps came into being somewhere around 2800 B.C. A soap-type substance was found accumulated in cylinders in ancient Babylon during excavations. It was a mixture of fats boiled with ash. Historians, therefore, attribute the beginning of detergents to that era. The next known use of detergents came from papyruses of the Egyptian civilization dated around 1500 B.C. The document showed a recipe of vegetable and animal oils blended together for washing and even skin ailments. Greeks introduced clay and sand as abrasives that were used with blends of ashes and oils. While this is the only knowledge of detergents in pre-historic times, it is the Romans who introduced the term soap derived from the sacrifice of animals at Mount Sapo. The residual fats and ashes of these sacrifices was found to clean effectively. By the middle ages, cleaning mixtures became commonplace around the world. The Germans in 1916 are credited for developing the first synthetic detergent as a requirement due to soap shortage in World War I. The synthetic detergents reached America in the 1930s. Ever since then manufacturers have been researching and developing innovative detergent blends, to get the near perfect cleansing of even stubborn stains. The housekeeper today has a variety of these products to choose from.\n\n",

      "content": "<!-- image -->\n\nStains are one of the greatest challenges to a housekeeper and laundry manager. Stains are inevitable in any operations and the expertise of the housekeeping department is judged by their ability to remove stains of varying types. The process of removing stains is called spotting. Good spotting equipment ( see picture alongside ) can be obtained at a moderate outlay and it will amply repay its cost in speeding up spotting operations in addition to creating an excellent standard of work. The advent of the steam gun and steam spotting table has done much to simplify the spotters task. The steam gun supported by a portable steamer (see picture below)\n\nhas proven to be an excellent piece of equipment for the removal of the majority of food stains, especially those of a sugary nature. The steam gun also accomplishes the removal of quite a large number of stains without using chemicals.\n\nThe steam gun must be carefully chosen as its design greatly influences the class of work which it will handle. The nozzle should be of the fish tail type as this is not so prone to blowing holes into fabrics. The handle should, if possible, be of the air insulated type as a handle which becomes hot during spotting slows down the work. In using the steam gun, the spotter should remember to spray with a continuous circular motion, holding the nozzle at an angle of 45 degrees in relation to the fabric. Brushes play an important part in spotting stain. Brushes with white bristles are ideal for use on white fabric, as should any soiling matter be picked up it is easily detected and the brush can be cleaned before a garment becomes soiled.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBrushes for woollens should be long-about 1 1/2 inch. Silk spotting brushes are usually smaller about 1 1/4 inches. The bristles are longer so as to avoid chafing the fabrics. All brushes must have a face which is perfectly flat as uneven bristles give a rough surface and damage the fabric. Brushes should be wellrinsed and left for drying each evening.\n\nFor the purpose of absorbing excess water, there is nothing finer than good chamois which should be large and thick. It should be rinsed in clean water and spread to dry. This will lengthen the life of the leather and prevent it from going old. Always use the chamois with a tamping action.\n\nIt is necessary during spotting operations to use an absorbent pad under stains which are being spotted, to soak up chemicals and solvents and the dissolved matter which they carry out, and so prevent the spreading of the stain.\n\nA drying cabinet is ideal to dry garments after spotting operations.\n\nA magnifying glass is most useful in spotting stains which are difficult to recognize with the naked eye.\n\n",

Beverages of all types, i.e. beer, tea, coffee, cola and medicines such as cough mixtures are few of the causes of this type of stain.\n\nBuilt up stains are caused by liquids which fail to penetrate the fabric and lie on the fabric surface. Stains of this nature are diverse such as paint, distemper, tar, sealing wax, lacquers, glues and resinous compounds.\n\nCompound stains are  a  combination of the previous two types as they both penetrate the fabric and leave a built-up residue on the surface of the material.

      "content": "As soon as the guest dials the number, the laundry desk attendant takes down the name and room number of the guest. Automated systems will give the guests name as soon as the room number is announced. The desk attendant can then continue the conversation using the guests name. The desk attendant may keep a running log of requests for valet service. He notes the time so as to monitor how soon the valet has attended to the call. He alerts the valet who proceeds to the guest room.\n\nAt the room, the valet knocks on the door announcing, Valet Service. This he does twice if required. The guest may invite the valet to collect the laundry. The hotel provides laundry bags found in the wardrobe. In the wardrobe are also two laundry lists, one for washing (Fig. 10.4), and the other for dry cleaning and pressing (Fig. 10.5) below. The lists are colour coded for easy identification. The guest should count the items and fill the Guest Count column. The valet proceeds to tally the garments with the laundry list by physically counting them. This figure he puts in the column Hotel Count. In case there is a discrepancy with the column Guest Count he brings it to the notice of the guest. He also checks each garment for tears, stains and spots to avoid any complaint by the guest when clothes are received after laundering. He may even offer to darn small tears as part of the service.\n\nWhile filling the laundry lists the valet also prices each item and writes the total sum payable. It is also important to record the type of service required, whether normal, urgent or express. Each hotel may term the urgency of service according to their local practice. Should the guest require a service other than normal service, the valet must inform the guest when he can expect the clothes and what additional charges that will be levied for such a service. It is the valets responsibility to keep the guest informed completely informed. Many foreign travels may not know the customs and practices of laundry services of that country. They will appreciate clarifications of the same.\n\nThis may not be possible for guests who leave the laundry in the room before they leave the room for their business. They may sometimes call the laundry desk and inform them about this. In such cases, the valet will request the floor room attendant to open the room to collect the laundry. In such cases, he will again tally the clothes with the guest count. In case of discrepancy, he must call the guest later and inform him or her of the discrepancy.\n\nFig. 10.4 Laundry List for Washing\n\n__ Hanger __ Folded                                                              |    || Gentlemen                   | Guest Count | Hotel Count                             | Price Total $ Amount     | General Instructions                                         |    || Shirt                       |             |                                         |                          |                                                              |    ||                             |             |                                         | 3.00                     | Please tick the desired service.                             |    || Suit (2 Pcs.)               |             |                                         | 8.00 3.00                |                                                              |    || Bush shirt                  |             |                                         | 5.00                     | Normal Service:                                              |    || Jacket                      |             |                                         |                          | Laundry  collected  before  10  a.m.  will  be               |    || Trouser                     |             |                                         | 5.00                     | returned on the same day after 6 p.m. at no                  |    || Vest                        |             |                                         | 2.00                     | additional  charge.

Archeologists have found Egyptian mummies dated 2500 B.C. shrouded in linen as good as what we have today. By 3000 B.C. cotton was grown in the Indus Valley, now in Pakistan and Western India. The Chinese began to cultivate silkworms about 2700 B.C. They developed special looms to weave silk. The ancient Greeks mainly used woolen textiles. They also used some linen. In 300 B.C. Alexander brought cotton goods from Taxila in now Pakistan to Europe. The ancient Romans developed a thriving trade in textiles. They imported woolen garments from Britain, Gaul and Spain; linen from Egypt; cotton from India; and silk from China and Persia.\n\nFrom 400 A.D. to the early 1500s, the textile industry prospered in Europe. Woolen production centered in England, northern Italy and Flanders. They even had weavers guilds to protect and promote the textile industry. The spinning wheel was developed by 1200 A.D. and Italy became the silk centre of Europe. They invented a machine to unwind silk from cocoons.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution in late 1700 A.D. was considered to be the Textile Revolution. A flood of inventions brought great advancement to the production of yarn and fabrics. Some of these inventions were:\n\n",

By the 1960s textile companies began making double knit fabrics of textured polyester yarns. These fabric were lighter in weight and more comfortable than double knits of other materials.

      "content": "Textile has traditionally meant a woven fabric. The term comes from the Latin word texere , meaning to weave. Many fabrics are still made by weaving yarn on a loom. But today all fabrics come under the generic name of textiles. Most textiles are produced by twisting fibres into yarns and knitting or weaving the yarns into fabric. While traditionally the process was done by hand, today machines do the job at incredible speeds rolling out rolls and rolls of fabric.\n\nThere are four major methods by which cloth is produced:\n\nThere are three basic weaves:\n\nAll other weaves are either variations of the above or mixtures of the three basic weaves. Plain weave is the most common pattern where the crosswise yarn passes over one warp yarn and under the next, alternatively through the width of the yarn. Plain woven fabrics are gingham, percale and taffeta. They are used for sheets, dresses and upholstery.\n\nTwill weaves are when four sets of yarns are picked up in the following order: 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4 and repeated I diagonal lines. Popular twill fabrics are denim and gabardine. As the twill is strong and tightly woven, it is best suited for coats, sportswear and hardy work clothes.\n\nSatin weaves are eight sets of yarns picked up in the following order 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. It may span upto 12 warp yarns. Common stain weaves include damask and satin.  Since this weave produces soft, luxurious cloth, it is best for expensive draperies, table linen and formal clothes.\n\nThe more the sets of yarns, the more intricate is the design. Therefore, there are three types of looms where the following kinds of fabrics are woven.\n\nThe chart below gives the range of fabrics made by the three types of looms:\n\n",

Fibres are collected together, sorted out and then twisted to form a yarn. Yarns are interlaced together to form a fabric. Most natural fibres used for textile production measure ½ to 8 inches.

The soil must be free from stones and made soft by gently tossing the soil over and raking it to distribute the soil into the bed. The next step is to add the manure or fertilizers to improve the soil.  Plants come as seeds, bulbs or saplings. Normally packaged materials give instructions on how to plant them. An expert will be needed to give advice on unpackaged seeds.  The trowel comes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninto play to dig the soil to plant the bulbs and sapling.  Large amounts of seeds can be sowed by making a channel in the soil with a hoe; sprinkling the seeds along the channel; and covering the seeds lightly with the soil. Pour water to complete the task.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nneeds to reach the roots, so thorough soaking of the soil is required each time. Part of caring is to take preventive measures to control disease and pests. Most packaged seeds give precautions towards seed care. Flower beds need to be kept clean because plant rubbish can be the breeding ground for plant bacteria and fungus. Pests too lay eggs in foliage and the housekeeper will need to look out for signs of pests like half eaten leaves.  Regular weeding is also a precaution against pests. There are a number of weed killer chemicals. But excessive use of them could damage the plants. A method to avoid weeds is by mulching. Mulch is a covering of\n\norganic materials, chopped leaves, compost, grass clippings, moss, etc that makes a layer over the soil to choke the weeds from getting air to breed. Some flowers are tall and will need support\n\n",

Indoor plants need special fertilizers but care must be taken not to over feed them. They need to be kept aside from outdoor plants to ensure that they do not get disease or pests. They should be watered when the soil just below the surface is dry. They should be watered with tepid water and not cold or hot water. The best time to water them is in the morning. The plants will need to be washed every two weeks to flush out dirt and any small pests that may have lodged on them.  The plants can be washed in floor pantries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nor in the greenhouse. Another way is to wipe the plants with a wet cloth or sponge on both sides.

Repotting can be achieved by inverting the old pot and let the plant with the soil slide into the hand. Place drainage material like pebbles or broken chips of clay pots, in the new container.

Jill had to achieve actual balance with the hanging arrangement so that it floated in the position she wanted.\n\nThe triangle  design  style  favoured  in  traditional  floral  arrangements and often seen in wedding and church flower arrangements can be used on window sills of function rooms or on banquet and meeting room tables. It uses strong symmetrical balance. The lines radiate from a central point in the middle of the design and each side is a mirror-image of the other.

Between yellow and orange, for example, is yellow orange, between blue and violet is blue violet and so on.\n\nAll these colours around the outside of the colour wheel are called saturated colours. They contain no black, no white and none of their complimentary or opposite colour.\n\nCompound colours are colours containing a mixture of the three primaries. All the browns, khakis and earth colours are compound colours.\n\nColour in Floral Art is the most striking of all the elements, and its impact is enormous.\n\nComplimentary colours are those opposite each other in the colour wheel, such as red/green, blue/orange and yellow/violet. Put these colours together and your eyes will almost sting as these colours are equal in colour value. Use these combinations to show off a special piece of plant material.\n\nA colour triad is a colour taken from 3 sides of the wheel, If this is blue/yellow/red you will create a circus or childs room effectbright and cheerful.\n\nPick only colours from one part of the colour wheel such as the blues/purples/greens youll get dark effectswatery, mystical, relaxing. Choose red/orange/yellow and show heat, light, zing, wow factor and stimulation.\n\nChoose two colours side by side from the wheel and one from opposite and youll get contrast and harmony working welltogether and the opposite colour balances the other two.\n\n",

Form is identified\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin space. Shape is two dimensional and is the outlined appearance of a form, e.g., circle, square, rectangle, triangle etc.\n\nForm is the 3 dimensional shape of a piece of plant material or a design as a whole. Forms can be round, and are called points. Forms that are long and thin are called spikes.\n\nIn this impressive design photographed at the Melbourne flower and Garden Show, the lilies are the points , the bird of paradise and raupo reeds are the line, called the spikes. The huge cones are also a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nform. It is necessary to have a contrast of forms in a design but having too many varieties of form is often a clutter, especially in modern work.\n\nA point can be regular or irregular, and rounds hold the eye longer than cubes. Large points attract you first and your eye rests there a while. An example of this is a flower face front on to the viewer. In the design on the left you can see how the lilies are placed not only full faced but also side view, down slanting, and up facing. This allows the eye to move on from the most dominant point.\n\nA design with all spikes or all rounds is very boring, and it is the interplay through a design of the two that makes it interesting.\n\nLets have a closer look at the design above. On the left is a part of the arrangement that is all  points.  You  look  at  it  quickly,  think  about  the lovely lilies, and move away. Now the part of the arrangement that is all\n\nspikes is on the left too. Once again it is monotonous and doesnt hold your interest for long. Therefore, you need both and suddenly you have the wow factor.\n\nWhen you select your plant material for a design be aware that you need this contrast. If you like the look of a bunch of little daisies and want to use them in an arrangement, think about another form that you need to make a contrast to them. They are rounds, so you need perhaps spikes. When you place your rounds, put them so that their faces face in different directions, so the eye moves form one to the other.\n\nFlorists at the moment, in a very simple way, are doing just that, adding bear grass (spike) to gerberas and roses (points.) In this bouquet one can see how the bear grass has made the difference, and added interest\n\n",

So the plant foliage had to be big, along with the accessory, the antirrhinums and the base it sits on. It also had to be tall to be in scale with the other parts of the design and even the towel drape had to be big and bold to fit to scale.\n\nA closer look at the design shows it was a full size deck chair and beach towel, so you can see the size of that base and those antirrhinums was huge!

Why?  Equal amounts may seem to be boring, and not interesting enough for the viewer to pause for long, while too much of any one thing may make it to dominate more than you wish.\n\nThe  arrangement  on  the  left  gives  an  idea  of  the  concept  of proportion. The setting was in the chapel in Stratford upon Avon, in England for Christmas 2001. The Floral Artists responsible for the wonderful, fresh, floral arrangements had the concept of proportion very clear in their minds!

      "content": "Flair  says  that  this  concept  is  The  visual  movement  achieved  in  design  by  repetition, graduation, variation or radiation. Motion and rest sustain interest in design.\n\nRhythm is achieved in a design if you have managed to move the viewers focus from one point to another. This can be done, as the definition states, by graduation. Graduation is achieved when you grade the flowers from the smallest at the edges of the arrangement to the larger flowers at the bottom or in the area of prominence. You can also grade the colours in a design with\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrong colours at the focal area and lighter colours further out. In this way the viewers focus moves from\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe stronger colours to the weaker ones.\n\nContrast is the basis of all good floral design and this is true too with  rhythm,  as  the  eye  needs  to  rest  for  a  while  on  a  design,\n\nbefore  it  takes  off  again  following another  path  you  have  set  for  it.\n\nTherefore,  you  also  need  to  create  calm  spots  and  this  can  be achieved with round forms or flat smooth leaves.\n\nLine material such as reeds, rope, branches, twigs, grasses, and ribbon can also create rhythm. As Poppys design on the right above shows, repeating several line forms with variation has created strong\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvisual movement. Several curved lines have a strong rhythm. If all lines are the same, regular rhythm can be created by shortening or lengthening some of the material.\n\nPoppy Fuller of Kerikeri New Zealand designed this whirl (see page 430) of visual movement and rhythm called The Twister for the Northland Designer of the Year 2001. Poppy used lichen, dried reeds, feathers, honesty seeds, red and green New Zealand Flax, stripped willow bark, copper wire and strips of gum bark wound around a metal frame to create the effect. It is a wonderfully free example of movement and rhythm created by repetition and variation. She used variable rhythm when the same type of line is used but they vary in shape and length\n\nThe design (see page 430) is by Diana Snowden of Kaitaia, New Zealand. The bottom placement shows perfectly how a round form among lines of movement allows your eye to rest for a moment, before it travels on. If you are a beginner, see if you can pick the other rhythmical devices Diana has used in the larger placement. Wreaths can be wonderful examples of rhythm.\n\n",

It protects hotel management from litigations due to injuries of this nature.\n\nLadders are key tools for cleaning high places or reaching higher shelves. Ladders come in many sizes from step stools to extended ladders. Ladders must be stable and strong. The rungs must be well fixed and any loose rungs must be attended to immediately before use. Ladders come in wood and aluminium. It is better to use aluminium ladders as they are light and look better than wood in public areas. The ladders must have rubber footing to prevent slippage. Ladders come with support rods so that they do not have to lean against walls to scratch them. Should the ladder be without support, it should be kept one fourth of its length away from the wall. The person climbing must be free of tools in the hand and should climb while facing the ladder. The employee should not climb to the top of the ladder to prevent the ladder from becoming top heavy and losing balance. It is preferred to climb leaving the last two rungs. Employees must position the ladder so as to reach the desired spots easily. Over-reaching can cause imbalance to the ladder. It is preferable to have someone holding the ladder from below even if it has support rods. The helper can pass tools as well as caution passers by from walking below the ladder. It may be prudent to put a sign Do not walk under the ladder. Employees must be prevented from using make-shift ladders like packing crates or chairs.\n\nCluttered workplaces have the hazard of falls. Employees must keep their areas free for easy traffic. Tools and articles must be kept against walls in corridors.\n\nCurled carpet ends can cause trips and falls. Usually hotels use synthetic carpets that stick to the floor to avoid curling. However, due to heavy traffic ends may be loosened and they can pose hazards. The housekeepers must be vigilant to these carpet ends in their daily inspections and should immediately have them re-glued to the floor. Rugs can cause curling over time. It is prudent to turn them over for a while so the edges regain their natural fall on the floor.\n\n",

      "content": "Guest theft  is  a  reality  of  the  hotel  business.  Guests  take  hotel  items  as  souvenirs  or  plainly because the items in a hotel are useful at home. Thefts are usually from rooms where items like towels, vanity sets, soaps, bathrobes and slippers are useful for common use. Some hotels may look at such items as marketing strategies especially when items are monogrammed with the hotel logo. They may not mind items like vanity sets, soaps and guest stationery are taken. The hotel may build such costs into the room rate. But items as towels and bathrobes are a serious concern  because  of  their  cost  to  replace  them.  Housekeeping  personnel  take  the  following precautions to prevent guest theft:\n\nKey control: Access to rooms is done by legitimate issue of keys. Guests who are registered into the hotel are provided keys to access their rooms. They are cautioned not to keep it lying around. When leaving the property they are required to hand their room keys to the receptionists or deposit them into secure key boxes at the reception. Master keys are controlled very strictly. Firstly, master keys have outsized key rings to prevent the keys from being pocketed. The outsized key  rings  force  the  bearer  to  hold  it  in  their  hand.  Secondly,  master  keys  are  issued  to  few legitimate personnel. They are the lobby manager and floor supervisor only. Each has to sign for them and register it into the log book. The movement of master keys is monitored closely. A master key lost is a major security threat to the property. Hotels may be forced to change the locks of the entire hotel at a great investment.\n\nSuspicious movements: Housekeeping personnel are trained to observe suspicious movements and report it to the security. Floor crews must learn to recognize guests that are registered into the hotel. Room maids are not permitted to open guest room doors for any guests. Legitimate residents are required to use their own keys and not have the room maid to open their doors.\n\nDeparture procedure: Hotels have trained bell boys to give a quick glance at the room and bathroom before they remove guest baggage. They look for missing towels, blankets, vanity sets, pictures, etc. Room maids too will follow-up the procedure if they notice a departure taking place. It provides a chance to question the guest at the front-office cashier desk.\n\nStandard issues to guest rooms: The ability to detect missing items is made possible by equipping rooms with standard number of items. So if a room has two bath towels the lobby or\n\n",

Windows are usually secured in centrally air-conditioned or heated properties. The housekeeping personnel have window keys to open them. This feature of construction reduces the element of theft. Room doors are provided with peep holes, door chain latch and double locking facilities to secure unauthorised entry when the guest is present.\n\nThe hotel business operates mostly on trust. In spite of the precautions given above, thefts do happen by few unscrupulous guests who are exceptions rather than the rule.\n\n",

      "content": "As in the case of guests, the employees find that most items used in a hotel are useful in the home as well, whether it is a towel, table napkin or a soap. A hotel reduces pilferage by adopting the following precautions:\n\nGate Pass: An employee is required to posses a gate pass, issued and authorised by the head of department whenever a hotel property is removed from the hotel. This gate pass is shown to the security officer at the time office from where employees exit and enter the hotel. Hotels provide the rule that all employees have only one entry and exit point to the hotel located at the back of the hotel where the time office is situated. The time office ensures that employees meticulously register their entry and exit on time cards.\n\nSpot Checks: Security personnel conduct spot checks of employee hand bags at random to ensure that unauthorised items are not being taken out of the hotel. A hotel item in possession of an employee without a gate pass is considered as theft and liable to dismissal from the service. Security personnel make spot checks of employee lockers periodically to ensure that any hotel property is not stored there, other than the employees uniform. Uniforms are not permitted outside the property.\n\nLimited Access: Employees have limited access to areas of the hotel. For example, a cook is not permitted to be on a guest floor nor a swimming pool attendant in the reception. The hotel provides uniforms to distinguish personnel in the hotel. All personnel are expected to be in their designated areas only. Only certain personnel are permitted on the guest floor. These are the room attendants, floor supervisors, laundry valets, room service waiters, security personnel, bell boys and maintenance staff. Each has distinguishing uniforms. Room attendants may open the guest room doors for these authorised personnel only after verification of their intentions. She has to be present when the guest is not in. Another aspect of limited access is the authority to enter stores. Only storekeepers and their helpers are permitted within stores and held totally accountable for items received and issued. Similarly, the keys to the housekeeping stores may be given to authorised supervisors only, just as the entry to the linen and uniform rooms is only open to the linen and uniform keepers only.\n\nPar Stocks: Room attendants have water-tight par stocks of items on their maid carts that have to be accounted for at the end of their shifts. Similarly, guest rooms have par stocks as mentioned earlier. Room attendants are held accountable for a set of rooms and they have to ensure that guest room par stocks are maintained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBomb Threats: Terrorism is a new concern for all public buildings. Hotels are prime targets for explosions by radical groups who want to make a statement. Housekeeping personnel must be alert to suspicious objects around, especially those that are unaccompanied. Room attendants are trained to report anything suspicious in guest rooms whether they be drugs, excessive amounts of money, arms and bomb-like structures.  A  hotel  would  have  worked  out  an  emergency  plan (discussed earlier in this chapter) to meet these threats. Most threats are just threats and do not require alerting guests.\n\n",
