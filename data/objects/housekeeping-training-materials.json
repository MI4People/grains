Often hotels also has a latest check-in time if the room is not prepaid, often 6pm8pm. For the most cost-effective usage of hotel room occupancy, a guest should try to reach at about hotel's check-in time and leave or hand over the hotel room at about the hotel's check-out time, but it may not be always practical because the guest's arrival and departure time of flights or car trips may not align with the hotel check-in and check-out time and for other reasons.\n\nThe housekeeping must be prepared at all time to adopt it selfe to eary chack in or check out.\n\n",
