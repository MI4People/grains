Many people have tried to describe the hospitality industry in different ways.  Some  tried  to  summarize  the  scope  of  the industry  and  its  characteristics  of  involving  both tangible  and  intangible  features  in  the  service delivery process. Others attempted to describe the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nindustry by exploring the stakeholders involved, mutual benefits generated and the industry's impacts to the society and economy.\n\nBroadly speaking, Hospitality is the act of kindness in welcoming and looking after the basic needs of customers or strangers, mainly in relation to food, drink and accommodation. A contemporary explanation of Hospitality refers to the relationship process  between  a  customer  and  a  host.  When  we  talk  about  the  'Hospitality Industry', we are referring to the companies or organisations which provide food and/or drink and/or accommodation to people who are 'away from home'. However, this definition of the 'Hospitality Industry' only satisfies most situations.\n\nIn this chapter, a brief summary about the characteristics and scope of the hospitality industry would be provided.\n\nResort hotel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

What else, apart from the food in restaurants and the facilities in hotel rooms, do you think can make your hospitality experience more enjoyable and satisfied?\n\nIn the hospitality industry, customers rarely consume pure products but a mixture of products and services. For example, one who dines in a restaurant will not only pay for the food and drinks but the services provided by the servers. The bill has covered both tangible and intangible experience.\n\nTangible features- for example, a steak as the main course, a glass of house wine, well groomed service staff and decoration of the restaurant.\n\nIntangible features- for example, a comfortable dining atmosphere or the friendly attitude of staff.\n\nA successful hospitality business does not only count on its products and services, but also how they are delivered. The qualities of staff and the way they deliver the service are often more important than the tangible products in making a hospitality experience satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Hence, the two features can contribute to the total experience in the service delivery process.\n\nAs  products  and  other  tangible  features  can  be  easily  imitated  by  competitors, hospitality operations which aimed for high-ended customers and 'superior' quality gradually spend more and more resources in enhancing the service standard as a strategy of differentiation.\n\n",
