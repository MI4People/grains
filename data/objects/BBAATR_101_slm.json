      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

      "content": "A definition of the hotel as a business entity was presented by hotel operators during the consideration of the hotel business to authorities of the National Recovery Administration, in Washington in 1933. This definition, as formulated by Stuart McNamara was as follows :\n\nHotels  provide  accommodation,  meals  and  refreshments  for  irregular periods for those who may reserve their accommodation either in advance or on the premises. In broad terms, hotels provide facilities to meet the needs of the modern traveller. The dictionaries define hotel in several ways : 'a place which supplies board and lodging', 'a place for the entertainment of the travellers', 'large city house of distinction', and 'a public building'.)\n\nThe common law states that a hotel is \"a place where all who conduct themselves properly, and who, being able and ready to pay for their entertainment, are received,\n\nHotel industry is the part of service industry, by& large hotel industry can be broadly responsible to provide food & shelter. The establishments, which offer only accommodation, are called as lodge & the properties serve food only are called as restaurants. In Australia and Canada, hotel may also refer to a pub or bar. In India, the word may also refer to a restaurant since the best restaurants were always situated next to a good hotel.\n\nA hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging, usually on a shortterm basis. The provision of basic accommodation, in times past, consisting only of a room with a bed, a cupboard, a small table and a washstand has largely been replaced by rooms with modern facilities, including en-suite bathrooms and air conditioning or climate control. Additional common features found in hotel rooms are a telephone, an alarm clock, a television, and Internet connectivity; snack foods and drinks may be supplied in a mini-bar, and facilities for making hot drinks. Larger hotels may provide a number of additional guest facilities such as a restaurant, a swimming pool or childcare, and have conference and social function services.\n\nAs being part of service industry, hotel industry has many characteristically differences between itself & other industries. Hotel businesses are open 365 days a year and twenty-four hours a day. No, we do not have to work all of them but we do tend to work longer hours than some other industries. Those on their way to senior positions in the hospitality industry and many others, for that matter, often work ten to twelve hours per day. Evenings and weekends are included in the workweek-so we have to accept that we may be working when others are enjoying free time. The hospitality industry depends heavily on shift work. Early\n\nin your career, depending on the department, you would be likely to work one of four shifts. Supervisors and managers often begin at 8 A.M. and work until 6 or 8 P.M., there are four shifts, beginning with the morning shift, so you may be getting up as early as 6 A.M. to get to the shift starting at 7 A.M. The midshift is normally from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M.; the evening shift starts at 3 P.M. and goes on until 11 :30 P.M.; and finally there is the graveyard shift, which begins at 11 P.M. and lasts until 7 :30 A.M. well, success does not come easily.\n\n",

The  origin  &  development  of hospitality industry is a result of tourism industry. When a person is away from his home, he needs accommodation, which cannot be carried along with. The primitive lodging houses or inns used to cater to the needs of the traveller. Throughout the world, such establishments were known by different names like Ryokans in Japan, Coffee Houses in USA & Dharmashala/Sarai in India.\n\nFig. 1.1 : Ryokans in Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe word hotel is derived from the French word hotel (coming from hÃ´te meaning host), which referred to a French version of a townhouse or any other building, rather than a place offering accommodation .a hotel is an establishment that provides paid accommodation & meals on a short-term basis. According to the British laws, a hotel is a place where a \"bonafied\" traveller can receive food and shelter provided he is in a position to pay for it and is in a fit condition to receive. The invention of currency & wheel are the two main factors that led to the emergence of hospitality activity as a commercial activity. From the modest ancient inns to present day hotel properties that provide all possible luxuries to the guest, the hotel industry has come a long way. The evolution of hospitality industry can be divided into 3 groups as :\n\nAncient Era : Earlier hotels or inns (as they were called as) used to provide the provision of basic accommodation, consisting only of a room with a bed, a cupboard, a small table and a washstand were run by the husband and wife team for  the  travellers.  They  also  provided  modest  wholesome  food  and  thirst quenchers like wines, alcohols, etc the basic purpose of travelling was limited to religion or survival. In olden days, people used to travel on horses & therefore there was a stable provided by the host for the horses. The entertainment and recreation  was  provided  by  the  host's  wife  or  his  children.  This  condition prevailed for several hundred years until the industrial revolution of England, which changed the purpose of travel to become business, related which was earlier mainly religious, or educational.\n\nGrand Tour : French revolution witnessed the golden age of travel .In 1670; Richard Lassel introduced the term Grand Tour in his book named as Voyage to Italy. The tourists of the grand tour were the young wealthy tourists who could afford the multiple years abroad. The Grand Tourists were mainly\n\nThe  Hotel  Industry\n\nIntroduction  to Hospitality Management\n\ninterested in visiting culturally important cities - Paris (France), Rome, and Venice (both in Italy) were the important destinations. Florence and Naples (both in Italy) were also popular destinations. The Grand Tourist would travel from city to city and usually spend weeks in smaller cities and up to several months in the three key cities. Paris was definitely the most popular city as French was the most common second language of the British elite, the roads to Paris were excellent and Paris was a most impressive city to the English.\n\nAs the goal of the Grand Tour was educational, upon their return to England, Tourists were supposedly ready to being the responsibilities of an aristocrat. As this tour often lasted for several years, it was a good business opportunity for the hotels in the above-mentioned cities.\n\nFig. 1.2  :  Francis Basset, The Grand Tourist\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Tourism is largely dependent on the range and type of accommodation available at the destination. Accommodation is a core area of the tourist industry and plays a distinctive role in the development of this ever- expanding industry.\n\nModern Era : The industrial revolution changed face of travel from travel for religious or health reasons to pleasure and holiday travel. Hence, there was a need for quick, luxurious and clean service. By 1800 AD, the U.S.A. was the leading in the development of modern first class hotels where as European hotel operated only luxury establishments to cater only to aristocrats. The American hotels were for anyone who could pay nominal rates. This factor had a great effect on hotel industry. In 1794, City hotel building was erected in New York It is interesting to note that this was New York's' first skyscraper. At the beginning at the 20th century, the hotel industry was confronted with the challenge of serving new generation.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, several luxurious hotels were built like The Palace in San Francisco (800 rooms), Sultan hotel in Jakarta (1104 rooms) & Grand Sierra Resort in Nevada (1995 rooms) & many more.\n\n",

For centuries, the ancient fortress, the defensive castle or the composite haveli was the abode of royalty and the nobility where hospitality was an integral part of life in Rajasthan. These Heritage hotels are a special treat to the visitors, as those who run or maintain these hotels have made sure that the traditional work, carvings, dÃ©cor and the style of hospitality remain as it were in the olden times of India. As already mentioned, these heritage hotels were home to the rulers; therefore, it is but natural that the architecture and dÃ©cor of these palaces are lavish. Some of these heritage homes are reflective of Rajputana and Mughal architecture. The architecture of these royal buildings was such that there were separate  viewing  galleries  for  the  women  of  these  households.  There  were separate wings constructed for the men, women, guests and the servants of the household.\n\nOver the centuries it has been the custom of these heritage homes in India, to provide hospitality to every person who visited these homes, now that most of these homes have been transformed into hotels, the owners Endeavour to maintain the traditional concept of extending a warm and hospitable atmosphere to each and every individual who visits these hotels in India.\n\nAfter the year 1947, that is in the post independence period the Government of  India  abolished  royal  titles  and  the  concept  of  feudal  lords  and  feudal ownership of lands in India. The Government of India withdrew the Privy Purse and special privileges to the royalty. Consequently, members of most of the royal\n\nfamilies found it extremely difficult to maintain these huge buildings in India. These large mansions lay almost abandoned or unattended till a few enterprising people realized that perhaps the only way to maintain these historic homes was their  appropriate  reuse.  In  addition,  the  large  palaces  of  the  Maharajas  set precedent by becoming five star luxury hotels. Later some of the heritage homes followed suit and are now functioning as luxury heritage hotels all over India.\n\nFig. 1.6  :  Sardargad Heritage  Hotel in  Rajasthan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

As an activity, \"travel\" also covers all the activities performed during a travel (movement).Travel can be for recreational purposes, for tourism, to visit people, for business or for commuting, and may occur for numerous other reasons, such as to obtain health care, migration, fleeing war, etc. Travel may occur by human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling, or with vehicles, such as airplanes, private transport, public transport, automobiles and trains.\n\nEven though both, travel & tourism involve movement of people from one place to another, tourism is wider term as compared to travel. As travel only deals with the movement & as well all the arrangements for that journeying ticketing for the journey, meals during the journey. Tourism includes all the arrangements for the entire experience. Travel ends at the destination, where as tourism does not. Tourism includes travel, accommodation at the destination, meals arrangement; sightseeing, shopping, recreational activities etc. are together called as tourism.\n\nThe  United  Nations  classified  three  forms  of  tourism  in  1994  in  its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics : Domestic tourism, which involves residents  of  the  given  country  travelling  only  within  this  country;  Inbound tourism, involving non-residents travelling in the given country; and Outbound tourism, involving residents travelling in another country.\n\nRecently, the tourism industry has shifted from the promotion of inbound tourism to the promotion of intra bound tourism because many countries are experiencing tough competition for inbound tourists. Some national policymakers have shifted their priority to the promotion of intra bound tourism to contribute to the local economy. Examples of such campaigns include \"See America\" in the United  States,  \"Malaysia  Truly  Asia\"  in  Malaysia,  \"Get  Going  Canada\"  in Canada, \"Wow Philippines\" in the Philippines, \"Uniquely Singapore\" in Singapore, \"100% Pure New Zealand\" in New Zealand and \"Incredible India\" in India.\n\nThus  we  can  say  that  Tourism  is  the  complex  phenomenon,  which comprises of the basic idea of shifting a traveller or a group of tourists, from one place to another, feeding them, making accommodation available, making various opportunities of entertainment available {either active or passive participation}, and returning them back to their homes.\n\n",

The word tourism did not appear in the English language until the early nineteenth century. The word tour was more closely associated with the idea of a voyage or perhaps a theatrical tour than with the idea of an individual \"travelling for pleasure purposes, which is the accepted use of the word today\". The World Tourism Organization's definition of tourism is \"Tourism comprises the activities of persons travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes.\"\n\nHunziker and Krapf, in 1941, defined tourism as \"the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity In 1976 the Tourism Society of England defined it as \"Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destination outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each\n\ndestination.  It  includes  movements  for  all  purposes.\"  In  1981,  International Association  of  Scientific  Experts  in  Tourism  defined  Tourism  in  terms  of particular  activities  selected  by  choice  and  undertaken  outside  the  home environment.\n\nTourism means different things to different people. For example, a hotelier might say that tourism is wonderful because it brings guests who fill rooms and restaurants. However, a government official might define it as the economic benefit of more money coming into the country, state or city. Whereas fir the host it might be nuisance to his peaceful life.\n\nA tourist, by United Nations (U.N.) definition, is 'a person who stays for more than one night and less than a year'. Business and convention travel is included in this definition.\n\n",

Not only were the Sumerians the first to grasp the idea of money and use it in business transactions, but they were also the first to invent cuneiform writing and the wheel, also they should be credited as the founders of the travel business. Five thousand years ago, cruises were organised and conducted from Egypt. Probably the first journey ever made for purposes of peace and tourism, was made by Queen Hatshepsut to the lands of Punt in 1480BC. Beginning in 2700BC the pharaohs began to take advantage of the abundance of good building stone in the Nile valley to build their elaborate burial tombs.\n\nThe earliest forms of leisure tourism can be traced as far back as the Babylonian and Egyptian empires. A museum of \"historic antiquities\" was open to the public in the sixth century BC in Babylon, while the Egyptians held many religious festivals attracting not only the devout, but also many who came to see the famous buildings and works of art in the cities. The local towns accommodated tourists by providing services such as : vendors of food and drink, guides, hawkers of souvenirs& touts.\n\nFrom around the same date, Greek tourists travelled to visit the sites of healing gods. Because the independent city-states of ancient Greece had no central authority to order the construction of roads, most of these tourists travelled by water, hence seaports prospered.\n\nThe lands of the Mediterranean Sea produced a remarkable evolution in travel. People travel for trade, commerce, religious purposes, festivals, medical treatment, or education developed at an early date.\n\nDomestic tourism also flourished within the Roman Empire. Second homes were built by the wealthy within easy travelling distance of Rome, occupied\n\n",

(Also, when your clients book travel to another area, you are providing a map of their destination could be a much-appreciated benefit from your agency.)\n\nAnother way to get business locally is to make courtesy calls on local hotels. Ask them to give out your business cards to their guests as referrals. The cards should be attractively printed with all necessary information; they should look professional and appealing.\n\nHowever, these are only first steps. To be a successful reception operator, you will need to actively solicit inbound business from other parts of the country.\n\nTalk with convention and state travel bureaus; approach local bus companies and hotels; contact tour packagers; go around the country to the travel shows; advertise your services. You could send brochures to travel agents in key cities install a separate telephone line and print special letterheads for the inbound part of your business. Look into the possibility of becoming affiliated with a tour operator, ground operator or another retailer.\n\nYou may also wish to talk personally with the major potential suppliers of clients, such as tour packagers.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

      "content": "Tourism has become a popular global leisure activity. In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide, representing a growth of 6.6% when compared to 2009. International tourism receipts grew to US$919 billion (â¬ 693 billion) in 2010, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.7%. As a result of the late-2000s recession, international travel demand suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007. This negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists' arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.\n\nTourism and travel-related services includes services provided by hotels and restaurants (including catering), travel agencies and tour operator services, tourist guide services and other related services.\n\nOne of the most crucial aspects of international tourism is the cross-border movement of consumers. This permits even unskilled workers in remote areas to become services exporters - for instance, by selling craft items, performing in cultural shows, or working in a tourismlodge.\n\nInternational Tourism Organization plays a role in promoting the development of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism, paying particular attention to the interests of developing countries. There are some official and non-official organizations, working for the tourism sector.\n\nIn  this  block  we  will  be  studying,  what  is  travel  related  products, International Tourism Organisations and Ecotourism and Adventure Tourism.\n\n",

Many food and beverages depend on tourism, especially in resort areas. Travel agents are often called on to recommend restaurants but except for package tours that include food and beverages, do not receive commissions from restaurant bookings. However, a hotel concierge in a luxury hotel may receive commissions, referral fees, and gratuities for arranging restaurant reservations. Restaurant may be divided into five main categories, as given below :\n\nClassical Restaurants : This group of restaurants emphasize gourmetstyle cuisine and are operated into European tradition. Classical restaurants have highly skilled chefs, most of whom have spent their entire life-times mastering the art of preparing fine meals. Many such establishments also have wine callers stocked with fine vintage wines. Another characteristic feature of the classical restaurant is elegant surroundings and a well-trained highly efficient staff.\n\nOccasional Restaurants : These restaurants may be formal or informal, with a well-disciplined menu and moderate to high prices. The interior may be decorated like a fine diningroom, dressing room, or living room. Traditional, family  style  meals  and  an  emphasis  on  'atmosphere'  are  the  main  trait  of occasional restaurants.\n\nSpeciality Restaurants : This category of restaurants has a limited menu that is cantered around a theme. The most popular ethnic restaurants specialize in Italian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, German, or Swedish cuisine. Some of the examples of these restaurants are steak houses, sea-food restaurants, and health-food restaurants.\n\nFamily-Style Restaurants : This group includes coffee shops and cafeterias. A typical family-style restaurant features a consistent level of food quality and services. Creating a sense of security and appealing a large cross-section of the dinning public. The menu may be either limited or diversified, but prices and services are usually moderate.\n\nFast-Food Outlets : Typical fast-food establishments are designed for efficiency and convenience, with a self-service counter, a limited menu, and competitive prices.\n\nFlight Catering : Also known as In-flight catering involving the planning and preparation of meals and the assembly of meal trays designed to be served on board an aircraft.\n\n",

However, the right of protection does not arise  from  a  passport,  nor  does  the  right  to  enter.  Each  right  arises  from nationality . A passport proves the nationality of the bearer and, consequently, their right of protection and right to enter.\n\nPassports usually contain the holder's photograph, signature, and date of birth, nationality and sometimes other means of individual identification. Many countries are in the process of developing biometric properties for their passports in order to further confirm that the person presenting the passport is the legitimate holder.\n\nPassports are usually required for international travel, though this is not always the case; they serve only as an internationally-recognized means of identification of the traveller. This requirement may be waived (the terminology may vary in different countries) in individu.0al cases or for classes of travellers.\n\n",

They  are  also  known  as  normal passports.\n\nDiplomatic passports are issued to diplomats and diplomatic representatives and other state employees according to the rules of a particular country. Having a diplomatic passport does not necessarily accord the bearer diplomatic immunity. Some countries' visa requirements may have different requirements for diplomatic and non-diplomatic passports. Occasionally they are given by states to foreign citizens with no passport of their own, often exiled VIPs who have been invited to live in that state, e.g. Constantine II of Greece travels on an Italian diplomatic passport.\n\nOfficial or Service passports are issued to employees (or \"Technical and Administrative Staff Members\") of a government travelling for work related reasons who either do not qualify as diplomats or are not entitled to diplomatic status under the Vienna Convention.\n\nSpecial  passports are  issued  to  high-ranking  state  officers  and  their dependents as a means of officially guaranteeing their exemption from visa requirements.\n\nAlien's passports are documents issued by some countries to non-citizen residents.\n\nA Collective passport may be issued, for example, for a school trip. All children on the trip would be covered by the group passport for the duration of the trip. A List of Travellers (LOT) is an EU variant of the collective passport that can be used for groups of school children. Visa national children may travel visa free within the EU if they are travelling on a) a list of travellers, b) in a party from a school and c) are resident in the state where the LOT was issued. In many cases these children may also travel without any further travel document.\n\nInternal passports have been issued by some countries, as a means of controlling the movement of the population. Examples include the iqama in Saudi Arabia, the Soviet internal passport system and the hukou residency registration system used in the People's Republic of China.\n\nEmergency or Temporary passports are issued to persons whose original passport has been lost or stolen and who need to urgently travel.\n\nBusiness passports are passports with extra pages issued to frequent travellers.\n\nLaissez-passer is a document issued by organizations such as the United Nations for their officials.\n\nFamily passports are passports that are issued to family units - parent(s) and child (ren).\n\n",

In  the  United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"leave to enter\"  granted  to  a  person  subject  to  control  when  they  enter  the  country. Alternatively  the  stamps  activate  and/or  acknowledge  the  continuing  leave conferred in the individuals' entry clearance.\n\nOther authorities, such as the Schengen system, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for 3 months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In both systems it is not allowed to stamp the passports of persons not subject to Immigration Control, for example citizens of that country (or other EU nationals within the European Union). This is because the stamping of the passport imposes a control that the person is not subject to.\n\nThis does not apply in other countries where the stamp in a passport simply acknowledges the entry and exit of a person - for example in Australia, Russia or China.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned.\n\nThe  colour  of  the  ink  or  the  style  of  stamp  may  also  provide  such information. In Hong Kong just prior to and after the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from the UK to the People's Republic of China, arrival and departure stamps were identical at all ports of entry--but only those applied at the airport are in black ink. The stamps applied at Hong Kong's sea and land border crossings were applied  in  purple  and  red  ink  respectively.  Immigration  stamps  applied  by Macau's immigration service under Portuguese administration had slightly different borders depending on whether the person arrived by land, sea or air but were all applied in the same colour of ink.\n\n",

Countries may also issue re- entry permits that allow temporarily leaving the country without invalidating the visa. Even a business visa will normally not allow the holder to work in the host country without an additional work permit.\n\nOnce issued, a visa will typically have to be used within a certain period of time.The validity of a visa is not the same as the authorized period of stay in theissuing country. The visa validity usually indicates when the alien can apply for entry to the country. For example, if a visa has been issued January 1st and expires March 30th and the typical authorized period of stay in a country is 90 days, then the 90-day authorized stay starts on the day the passenger reaches the country, which has to be between January 1st and March 30th. The traveller could therefore stay in the issuing country until July 1st.\n\nOnce in the country, the validity period of a visa or authorized stay can often  be  extended  for  a  fee  at  the  discretion  of  immigration  authorities. Overstaying a period of authorized stay given by the immigration officers is considered illegal immigration even if the visa validity period isn't over (i.e. for multiple entry visas) and a form of being \"out of status\" and the offender may be fined, prosecuted, deported or even blacklisted from entering the country again.\n\nEntering a country without a valid visa or visa exemption may result in detention and removal (deportation or exclusion) from the country. Undertaking activities that are not authorized by the status of entry (for example, working while possessing a non-worker tourist status) can result in the individual being deemed removable, in common speech an illegal alien. Such violation is not a violation of a visa, however despite the common misuse of the phrase, but a violation of status hence the term \"out of status.\"\n\nEven having a visa does not guarantee entry to the host country. The border crossing authorities make the final determination to allow entry and may even cancel a visa at the border if the alien cannot demonstrate to their satisfaction that they will abide by the status their visa grants them.\n\nVisa and immigration laws may be very different among countries. As such, aliens are advised to check with the relevant officials for visa and immigration laws governing the countries they wish to enter and eligibility to receive visas or other immigration benefits.\n\nTravel-Related Products\n\n",

      "content": "International cooperation in any field of activity in the modern world has assumed  a  great  importance.  The  cooperation  brings  together  governments worldwide for negotiations in activities mutually beneficial to all of them. The growth and development of any discipline largely depends on the manner in which it associates itself with those pursuing a similar discipline. The world bodies or the international organizations provide a platform where ideas are exchanged, topics of mutual interest discussed, and solutions arrived at. The participants coming from various disciplines- arts, science, medicine, commerce, travel, to name a few-meet together and discuss areas of mutual interest. Through these discussions new ideas and information develops which helps in the growth and promotion of a discipline.\n\nIn  the  field  of  tourism,  organizations  emerged  with  the  objective  of developing and promoting the subject of tourism. The international organizations in particular have played a key role in strengthening tourism by way of combined efforts and therefore their role is of vital importance. The increasingly international character of modern tourism and the growing influence of international agencies in various fields are reflected in the growth and development of international cooperation and organization in tourism. Organizers and the providers of various tourist services whether in the government, private or public sector come together at various forums at the international level to discuss and share common problems and arrive at certain conclusions ? The providers of tourist services sometimes meet as individuals or as individual firms, but more often when their national secretarial organization is a member of a particular international body, which has been set up for general or specific purposes.\n\nVarious international organizations in the field of tourism are operating today. Some of these organizations are specifically concerned with the development and promotion of tourism at the international level while others deal with the development and promotion of tourism in a particular region. There are other international organizations, which do not concern themselves specifically with tourism, but with fields indirectly connected will tourism like airlines, travel agents and the hoteliers.\n\n",

      "content": "In the year 1963, the importance of the work of the international organizations in the field of tourism was recognized by the United Nations Conference on International Travel and Tourism held in Rome in the year 1963. The conference recommended that \"the United Nations should consider the International Union of Official Travel Organizations (IUOTO), founded in 1947, as its main instrument for the promotion of tourism\". The encouragement given by the United Nations to IUOTO paved the way for greater cooperation at the international level in the field of tourism.\n\nThe growth of international tourism in the twenties and the consequent need for cooperation between the national tourist bodies, led to the holding of an international conference in 1925 called by the National Tourist Office of Holland.  Representatives  of  fourteen  countries  took  part  in  the  conference. Further conferences led to the setting up of the International Union of National Tourist Propaganda Organizations (IUNTPO) at The Hague. This body sought to promote facilitation and overcome the obstacles to free international tourist traffic; such obstacles having come about as a result of the 1914-18 World War. IUNTPO, whose general aims were more streamlined than its tide, established close contact with the Economic Committee of the Old League of Nations.\n\nDuring the Second World War, IUNTPO had to discontinue its practical activities. It was with the object of contributing to post-war reconstruction that one of its members, the Travel Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, decided in the spring of 1964 to call a World Conference of National Tourist Organizations to discuss the restoration and reconstruction of travel facilitation destroyed by the war. The conference took place in London in October 1946 and the following year, in 1947, the International Union of Official Travel Organizations (IUOTO) was founded. The Organization represented over one hundred national tourist  offices  of  various  countries  as  full  members  and  about  eighty-eight\n\nInternational  Tourism Organizations\n\nIntroduction  to Hospitality Management\n\nnational and international organizations, of both public and private sector, as associate members. It was at that time the only organization whose activities related to every aspect of tourism throughout the world. One of its major tasks was the stimulation and coordination of tourism development. The category of full members was restricted to national tourist organizations or other organizations set up to promote the development of tourism establishments and recognized by the  governments  of  the  countries.  The  category  of  associate  members  was confined to international or national organizations, either commercial or noncommercial,  representing  tourist  interest  or  interested  in  the  promotion  of tourism.\n\nThe  only  international  organization  IUOTO  grouped  together  the governmental or official tourist organizations of all parts of the world on the basis of one for each country and territory. The principal aim of the organization was to stimulate and increase 14 free flows of persons in the interest of economic development and to strengthen social and cultural relations. This it tried to do by way of resolving the problems arising in the field of tourist movements and in the adoption of a common policy amongst members for all questions dealing with international travel. The organization tried in various ways to develop the touristindustry in the member countries and particularly by promoting measures on a national as well as on an international level, aimed at reducing travel barriers and stimulating the movement of travellers.\n\n",

It was formed owing to the transformation of IUOTO and was called upon to succeed it. The swift expansion of travel had created the need for a world body able to deal with tourism problems at the government level and this led to the transformation of IUOTO into WTO.\n\nThe headquarters of the organization were set up in Madrid (Spain) in January 1976. The activities of the organization cover all sectors of tourism on a worldwide basis. WTO works in cooperation with all international organizations, the United Nations in particular, as well as with commercial and non-commercial bodies involved in tourism. The WTO has a very emphatic technical character.\n\nThe World Tourism Organization was originally conceived as an intergovernmental organization in a UN General Assembly resolution on December 6, 1969. This resolution called for the establishment of WTO to play a \"central and decisive role\" in the field of tourism and to maintain effective collaboration with the appropriate organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. At Torremolinos, in June 1977, the second General Assembly of WTO approved an Agreement with the United Nations for Cooperation and Relationship. On 20th December 1977, the 32nd General Assembly of the UN approved this Agreement, which is now in force. In immediate implementation of this Agreement, the UN General Assembly in December 1977 also approved a resolution sponsored by the Philippines with 24 cosponsors, including India, requesting the WTO \"to intensify its efforts to promote tourism, particularly in the developing countries, through international cooperation and to report to the General Assembly at its 33rd session on action taken\".\n\n",

      "content": "In  the  business  of  travel,  the  International  Air  Transport  Association (IATA), the world organization of scheduled airlines have played a key role since its inception in the year 1945. A world association of about 200 Active Members and 35 Associate Members, the International Air Transport Association was a result of the rapid expansion in the network of international airlines in the years following the Second World War. A need for the worldwide regulation of air traffic including co-coordinating international airfares and rates was felt and consequently  an  international  convention  was  called  by  President  Franklin D.Roosevelt of the United States of America at Chicago from November 1 to December 7, 1944. The Convention constituted two permanent bodies, namely,the international  Air  Transport  Association  (IATA)  and  the  International  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n\nHowever, before reaching the position that it now occupies in the field of aviation,  IATA  passed  through  several  stages,  in  parallel  with  a  spectacular development of commercial aviation. Its modest beginnings date back to 1919 when the International Air Traffic Association was founded in Hague by half a dozen European airlines that had just been created right from the beginning; they recognized the need to cooperate in setting up a network for rationalizing airlines business.\n\nThe  International  Air  Traffic  Association  expanded  steadily  with  the development of air services in the world. Among other things, it drew up the general  formula  for  tickets  and  transport  documents  adopted  in  1927.  The innovations  and  improvements  introduced  by  the  Association  progressively placed unique tools at the disposal of the industry.\n\nIn November 1944, as the World War was coming to an end, 54 states met in Chicago to lay the first foundation of the new system that would soon be needed by civil aviation. The Conference led to the creation of the International Civil Aviation Organization\n\n(ICAO), the international body set up by government to establish universal norms for the technical regulation of civil aviation. Indirectly, this Conference\n\n",

IATA's work begins only after governments have promulgated a formal exchange of traffic and other rights (bilateral air transport agreements) and have licensed the airlines selected to perform the service. From that point on, the activity of IATA spreads through virtually every phase of air transport operations.\n\nThe basic source of authority in IATA is the annual general meeting in which all active members have an equal vote. A year-round policy direction is provided by an elected executive committee and its creative work is largely carried out by its financial, legal and technical and traffic advisory committees. Negotiations of fares and rates agreements is entrusted to the IATA Traffic Conferences with separate conferences considering passenger and cargo matters, all establishing agreements valid for periods of two years.\n\nMembers of IATA committees are nominated by individual airlines and, subject to the regulation and review of the executive committee, serve as experts on behalf of the entire industry. In the Traffic Conference, however, delegates act as representatives of their individual companies. While the executive committee fixes the terms of reference of these conferences, their decisions are subject only to the reviews of governments and cannot be altered by any other part of IATA.\n\nThe IATA administration is headed by a Director General and five Assistant Directors General. The Association has two main offices, one in Montreal and the other in Geneva. Regional Technical Directors are based in Bangkok, Geneva, London, Nairobi and Rio de Janeiro and Regional Directors (Special Assignments) in Singapore and Buenos Aires. IATA Traffic Service Offices are located in New York and Singapore.

Policies approved are recorded in the technical manual.\n\nIATA has played and continues to play, an important role in the drafting of the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices, which form the accepted international pattern for the technical regulation of civil aviation, and cooperates closely with ICAO to encourage governments to implement them fully and keep them up-to-date. IATA works in much the same way with other organizations such as the International Telecommunications Union, the World Meteorological Organization and the International Organization for Standardization.\n\nIn  addition,  IATA  provides  means  for  member  airlines  to  enter  into consultation with ICAO, with individual states or with the countries comprising a particular region on the planning and implementation of air navigation facilities and services. This work is generally carried out, under the control of the Technical Committee, by global and regional working groups, which deal with new and developing problems in all technical fields of air transport operations.\n\nThe annual technical conference provides an international forum in which the airlines and related branches of transport aeronautics can discuss technical development  on  a  broader  basis.  Whereas  normal  IATA  technical  work  is concerned with the problems of integrating into airline use a particular new procedure on a device already available, the conference attempts to fix the relationship between devices, to work out the general requirements of the airlines for new equipment, devices and systems and to set up development priorities which will help airlines, governments and manufacturers, to attain their goals and maximum efficiency and economy.\n\nThere are also numerous sub-committees, which meet throughout the year. One is the Medical Advisory Committee, which deals with the physiological and psychological facts, which might affect the safety and well-being of aircrew and passengers.

      "content": "related matters. In almost all these areas, IATA works towards adapt the forms and procedure to processing by computer and teletype.\n\nFor the public, IATA has formulated a single formula for a ticket or airway bill on international air transport that is from anywhere in spite of the geographical barriers, national boundaries, linguistic, monetary, legal, economic and other differences. Through IATA agreements, the airlines have adopt standard codes of relations with their passenger and cargo agents and consolidators, which assure the agents of fair, uniform and non-discriminatory treatment. Committees screen and special boards all agencies and scrutinize their qualifications to serve the public and the airlines.\n\nSuch arrangements are usually carried out under the leadership of the Traffic  Advisory  Committee,  expert  working  groups  and  Assistant  Director General (Traffic) and his staff. This is usually under the guidance of other standing committees. Actual application, however, comes about mainly through formal resolutions that are subject to the approval of governments. Virtually every IATA traffic action is the result of this unusually comprehensive and successful process of international agreement reached through the IATA Traffic Conferences, where decisions must be taken by unanimous vote.\n\nThe Traffic Conference process comes up from the uncharacteristic nature of air transport. Every inch of the world's surface is accessible by air and the airlines fly between most of their major cities over a maze of interrelated routes. Nevertheless, every government reserves complete control over its own share of the airspace and the right for determining what the air services levy on the public. International fares and rates and conditions which underline them must therefore be fixed by international agreements in which virtually every country has some direct or indirect concern.\n\nFor administration purposes, there are three Traffic Conference areas : No.1 for the Western Hemisphere, Greenland and the Hawaiian Islands, No. 2 for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, including Iran and No. 3 for Asia, Australia and the South Pacific. Conference business is organised within the framework of these areas, or on an inter-conference basis, but practically, the interrelation of fares and rates throughout the world makes it necessary that all of these conference sessions are held at the same time and place.\n\nUsually, worldwide composite conference meetings are held every two years-in the autumn-to review rates and fares for passengers operations and in spring to think about matters that involve air cargo. Special meetings are called in the interval and action is taken immediately by mail vote, subject to the same rules of unanimity and government approval. The sessions of the conferences are prefaced by months of careful preparation and study, not only by continuing traffic working groups, but also by research and cost committees, which forecast the result of operation to which fares and rates are related. Preparatory work of this nature is under the direction of a Commissioner, Commercial Planning and Coordination.\n\nThe workload of the conferences has been spread since the establishment of the permanent traffic conferences committees, which deal with traffic, handling procedures and agency matters except for fares, rates and commissions. These committees  namely  the  Cargo  Agency,  Passenger  Agency,  Cargo  Traffic Reservations and Passenger Traffic -also function based on unanimous vote.\n\nDecisions of the Traffic Conferences and their permanent committees are subject  to  review  and  approval  by  interested  governments  before  becoming effective. The conferences may accept the advice of other parts of IATA, but within their terms of reference they are responsible only to governments and thus to the public, for what they do. Enforcement of IATA resolutions is the duty of a Compliance Office, which, under the Director General, strives to ensure that members respect the obligations, which they have voluntarily assumed.\n\nThe flexible nature of the IATA traffic machinery is quite evident over the difficult years of expansion (from 1946). Not only have rates and fares been compatible on the \"blue ribbon\" North Atlantic routes, but they have also been effective on other major world trunk routes and on the regional feeder services in less developed areas. The trend of rates and fares has been downward and it is significant that the governments concerned have ever disapproved less than five per cent of the conference resolutions even in part. This is a substantial proof of JATNs minute concentration to the public interest. Over the years, other services have been added to the traffic organization. Among these is the Traffic Publications  Office,  which  prepares  prints  and  distributes  IATA  manuals  of conference resolutions and recommended practices, directories and handbooks, which are the tools of the international industry.\n\n",

Airlines have their operations between major cities, which often have criss-crossing routes. For an airline, any country is accessible by air. Today governments in most countries of the world reserve control over their own airspace as also over what air carriers may charge the public for using their services. The subject of international rates and fares and the circumstances that emphasize them are the subjects wherein almost every country has some direct or indirect matter.\n\nTariff coordination framework of IATA is formed with the aim of providing sufficient flexibility Provision has been made for IATA members to introduce innovative passenger fares or cargo rates to respond quickly to market changes without necessarily affecting other tariff in their area of operation. Participation in  such  activity  by  IATA  member  airline  is,  however,  optional.  Airline representatives attend tariff coordination meetings as independent agents on behalf of their companies. Certain level of compromise in this case is advantageous; nevertheless,  in  the  final  analysis,  governments  may  need  resolving  major disputes that are related to cargo rates and passenger fares. Tariff coordination meetings are held worldwide as and when the members consider these necessary. These meetings are held annually.\n\n",

It is a documentation centre and publishes on behalf of its members, issuing internal manuals, tabulations of airlines distances, technical surveys, reports and other important industry information. The Association Protection Advisory  Committee  comprises  of  senior  representatives  in  the  economic, technical, public relations fields and legal, studies the manner in which airlines can reduce noise and emissions and yet profit from the progress of technology.\n\nIn the field of public relations, IATA maintains a worldwide information programme, furnishes source material for students of air transport, acts as a spokesperson for the industry and provides a number of special publicity and promotional services. The work of IATA's Public Relations Department, guided by the Public Relations Advisory Committee, also includes the organization of PR Conferences and Regional Panels as part of its effort to foster cooperation among the public relations offices of member airlines.\n\nIn order to carry out several functions, IATA has a staff of over 500 people through the world and operates with funds provided in the form of annual dues paid by members.\n\nBroadly speaking, IATA is the world association of scheduled airlines with which it coordinates its efforts to serve its passengers, shares their experiences and analyses their problems. Representing over 180 companies from100odd countries, together they provide a bulk of world scheduled air services. IATA plays a leading role in three respects, on the basis of the aims defined in its statutes. The Association provides machinery for the airlines for finding joint solutions to problems often beyond the resources of any single company. Through the Association, airlines have succeeded in standardizing their operating methods and with their complementary routes, they have created a worldwide public service network, despite the many differences in language, currency, legislation and regulations.\n\nThe Association is able to act as an intermediary between governments and their users. It is the world parliament of airline companies and their spokesperson vis-a-vis various other international bodies. For governments, it serves as a forum where proposals for international rates and fares are formulated in a natural context for study and approval. For the general public it symbolizes the uniform quality of services, the use of rational commercial methods by airlines and agents, the simplification of formalities and the lowest possible fares and rates consistent with sound economy. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) plays a very important role in the area of representing and serving not only the airline industry but also the general public who use its services. The activities and goals of IATA cover the entire gamut in the areas of air transport, which is the key to the development of modem travel and tourism.\n\n",

      "content": "Tourism industry and its demands cause seriousdamage to our environment. Because of increase demands of touring people, development at tourist's places can lead to destruction of its very natural resources that attracts travellers. Due to these reasons, travel industry characterized a new approach to tourism which supports the conservation of natural resources, habitats etc by avoiding harming or  destroying  normal  environment.  Tourism  which  has  very  less  impact  on\n\nenvironment is known as Ecotourism or Ecological tourism. In travel and tourism industry  Ecotourism  is  one  of  the  largest  growing  sectors.  The  purpose  of ecotourism in order to maintain species and habitats especially in underdeveloped regions is to engross tourists in non-consumptive, low impact and locally oriented environments.  There  are  many  other  terms  for  ecotourism  like  sustainable tourism, green tourism, ethical tourism, environmentally friendly tourism, adventure travel etc.\n\nIt is a given that all travel will have some negative environmental impact, including pollution, habitat disruption and resource depletion. The challenge for ecotourism is to minimize that impact, which is one of ecotourism's ultimate goals, while providing economic incentives to local people and businesses.\n\nOne of the largest discrepancies in the travel industry is the confusion between  ecotourism  and  adventure  travel.  While  the  terms  are  often  used synonymously, their goals and impacts can be very different. Adventure travel insulates  you  from  the  local  environment  and  then  utilizes  its  resources. Unfortunately, there is a blur between the two. Adventure travel is definitely big business, but only some of it is green. Because the business is so vast and competitive, many tour operators adopt eco-friendly practices for their own selfpreservation and to grow their business. They need to preserve these areas for future business, for that they need to adopt environmentally friendly activities.\n\n",

Ecotourism starts getting popular in general public at the start of 1990s. Its starts with a boom and its growth increase by 20 per cent every year since 1990 to 1996. Ecotourism and adventure tourism continued its growth in new century also and United Nation designated the year 2002 as International Year of Ecotourism because of its growing popularity. In 2004 World Tourism Organisation declares that ecotourism was growing three times faster than the tourism industry. For many countries, ecotourism is not simply a marginal activity to finance protection of the environment, but a major industry of the national economy. For example, in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nepal, Kenya, Madagascar and territories such as Antarctica, ecotourism represents a significant portion of the gross domestic product and economic activity.\n\nRising conscious about the global warming and the destruction of the charm  of  its  natural  resources  and  beauty  by  the  tourist  are  some  biggest motivators for this market growth. Visiting to the new places or unexplored places offer a chance to socialize with the local population as people need a change from the  stressful  routine.

There is the Me Too Movement, for example, the tourism industry is no exception to this. One of the recent trends in ecotourism is to improve and support the local women and empower them. Societies are searching for ways to promote gender equality and help women reach their full economic potential.\n\nNature Reserves and Safaris : Recently, various lodges and camps are opening in Africa, which is a significant step for eco-travel. This idea is to make travelling more responsible towards sustaining natural reserves.Game reserves primarily allow wildlife animals to live safely, and they also play a huge role in the development of communities in natural-diverse areas. Now, local communities get benefits from Ecotourism as they are contributing to protecting wildlife and making sure that their impact on the environment is favourable.\n\nDiscovering New Less Crowded Places : It isn't too delightful to visit a monument crowded with people, but that is not the only reason for avoiding crowded  places.  More  often,  travellers  are  taking  more  responsibility  and avoiding places struggling with over-tourism and looking for new less crowded place which is on the top of the list of recent traveller.\n\nSay 'No to Plastic : The plastic waste crisis has been quite a debate for the past few years and recent sentiments of people are completely against the usage of plastic. A 2017 study found that 6.3 billion tons of the world's 8.3 billion tons were plastic waste. Embracing ecotourism involves actively reducing plastic footprint. Travelling itself is an eye-opening activity; it could also allow people to notice the seriousness of some issues like the harsh consequences of plastic pollution.\n\n",

Commercial adventure travel includes hiring of a professional guide to provide a range of technical support, regional support, cultural and nature interpretation and equipment. In the mid 1800s, adventure travellers began to push the limits of adventures like mountain climbing and river rafting, with the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 and decent of the Colorado River in 1869. Shortly thereafter, two key institutions were formed, The National Geographic Society and Explorers Club. These institutions are supporting adventures tourism continuously. In the mid-1950s, many adventurers attracted global attention and recognition, thus inspired many people to attempt their own expeditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaurice Herzog's ascent of Annapurna in 1950, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's ascent of Mount Everest, and other successes were hailed in the media around the world.

There is so much to improve but time is running out as the country is facing increasing competition from other Asian countries. The factor which mostly restrains adventure tourism in India is poor road condition and connectivity to adventure tour destinations. This problem is almost common for each region, once again pointing at poor state of infrastructure of the country.

      "title": "ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

      "content": "The primary function of a hotel is to provide lodging accommodation & meals. At the same time provides luxuries like recreation facilities etc. It is the responsibility of the hotel to pay maximum attention towards the comforts of the guests. The first interaction between the hotel & the guest is the reservation (when the guest enquires about the room). As first impression is the last impression & thus hotel should take efforts in giving good experience at the time of reservation. The reservation staff must keep themselves updated about the status of the rooms, the facilities & the amenities the hotel is offering. As rooms generate considerable revenue  for  the  hotel,  reservation  demands  a  great  deal  of  attentiveness  & responsibilities. The reservations could be confirmed or waitlisted as well as guaranteed & non-guaranteed.\n\nAs a part of the front office team an individual is involved with one of the two processes reservation or registration on day-to-day basis. Hence, in this unit we cover the various means through which the hotel receives reservations.

The front office manager is responsible for the smooth functioning of the front office functions.\n\nFront desk generally consists of the reception and cashier while front office is a department which includes all its sub-sections. The front desk area in a hotel is operational 24 hours per day. It is the centre of a hotel, the place where guests turn to seek information, to get help, and to register most of their complaints. When the busy check-in or check-out times occur, the front desk area takes on the challenge of serving every guest as quickly as possible. This is a challenge because just checking in or checking out the guest quickly is not enough. All guests must be dealt with in such a way that they feel as though they have received special treatment. The front desk supervisor is the person who is directly involved in meeting this challenge.\n\nThrough the registration process, the guest service agent provides the first initial contact a guest has with the hotel. After this contact, guests feel that the front desk is the place to call or go when they have a question or problem. An area that needs special attention is the effect that the agent has on the guest's perception of the hotel and the amount of satisfaction the guest will derive from his or her stay. The effect of a pleasant, friendly, helpful agent, as opposed to one that is rude, aloof and uncaring, can easily be seen. The basic functions performed by the guest service agent are the registration process (with related cashier duties) and the assisting of guests with any requests they make. The guest service agent's main concern is, of course, service to the guests. This service can be accomplished by acknowledging the guests' presence even if they cannot be served at once, always calling guests by name, and smiling and looking at the guests when serving them.\n\nThe night auditor prepares various reports for management. Statistics such as  the  average  room  rate,  percentage  of  double  occupancy,  percentage  of occupancy and other figures are needed daily by management to review the results of  operations.

      "content": "In the rooms division most departments or sections are involved in the sales of rooms as well as the provision of services and facilities for guests.\n\nThe rooms division is composed or two major departments : the front office department and housekeeping department. Within the front office and housekeeping departments, smaller departments will be formed to focus on specific duties. Only the largest hotel will have all of these different departments.\n\nTelephones : The telephone department of hotels is now utilizing automated systems, making it possible to employ less staff in the telephone department. A computer based switchboard systems makes it easier to transfer calls to guestrooms and departments. Call accounting systems can automatically calculate costs of\n\ntelephone calls and charge it to the guest accounts. Voice processing systems enables guests to programme their own wake-up calls. Voice message recording enables callers to leave voice messages. Direct dialling facilities are standard in most hotel rooms. The switchboard is operational 24 hours a day and often the location of the fire-checking equipment.\n\nReservations : The reservations department falls under the front office even though their office might not be located in the front office area. Internet reservations  and  enquiries  made  through  email  or  fax  is  dealt  with  by  the reservations department the following day. Reservation office staff must observe the utmost of telephone etiquette and speak in a clear voice.\n\nReception : The main responsibility of the reception is checking guests in and out of the hotel. They also handle any queries from guests and visitors or  refer  them  to  the  appropriate  department.  The  reception  desk  will  be operational 24 hours a day. As discussed earlier, the larger the hotel, the more specialised the duties of the reception personnel.\n\nCashier : The main responsibility of the cashier is accepting payment of guests' account and dealing with currency exchanges. When a hotel has safe deposit boxes, this will fall under the cashier's responsibility. Revenue centres such as the restaurants, bars and reception, will receive their floats and pay in their takings at the cashier's office. The head cashier may prepare the banking and carry out the paying-in to bank, but in some units this will be done by a member of the accounts staff. The night auditor covers the night shift between 11.00pm to 8.00am hours. During these hours the main responsibilities are to post charges to update client accounts, produce a trial balance and prepare management reports. As the cashier has access to large amounts of money, honesty is one of the most important qualities a cashier should have. The cashier must also be familiar with money and confident in handling very large sums.\n\nBill Office : The posting of charges and payments on to guests' accounts are handled by the bill office. At the end of the day and accounting periods, the bill office is responsible for extracting summaries of sales figures. Bill office staff needs to be methodical and have a grasp of figures. The bill office is becoming more automated with charges being posted directly to guest accounts through Point of Sale systems, allowing for fewer staff to be employed in the bill office.\n\nUniformed Staff Department : The department is headed by the bell captain, which is more often referred to as the concierge. Concierge is the French term for porter. In large hotels concierge is different from bell desk. Other staffs in this department include doormen and luggage bell boys. Again, the size of the hotel,  the  standard  of  the  hotel  and  type  of  customers  will  influence  the organisation of the uniformed staff department. In smaller hotels, the concierge responsibility can be taken over by the reception. The hotel might then only have luggage porters to assists guests with luggage. Budget hotel might not have this department at all.\n\nKiosk : A kiosk selling newspapers, gifts and other essentials is often located inthe hotel lobby. This shop will either be operated directly by the hotel, or, more commonly, be rented out as a concession to a specialist company. In the concession agreement the hotel will have the right to dictate important points concerning opening hours and the range of goods on sales.\n\n",

Also, it is worth noting that  in  the  commercial  sector,  catering  may  be  the  main  activity  of  the organization or it may be a secondary or additional service to customers as, for example, catering in department stores or theatres. A broad distinction can be made between catering for a restricted market and catering for a general market. In the case of the former, the market can be restricted in a number of ways : by way of membership criteria as in the case of catering in clubs or by the fact that the catering is only available to those engaged in a specific activity as in the case of travel catering or employee catering. However, there will be some overlap in some cases. For example, catering at a railway station, bus or airport terminal is normally open to the traveller as well as to the general public, while catering on the train, bus or plane itself is limited to those travelling double advantage of offering the customer a place to sit and relax away from the dining area and allowing a faster seat turnover in the restaurant.\n\n",

Some brewery companies have classified their public houses by the level of catering offered. This ranges from those offering only sandwiches through to hot and cold snacks, a cold buffet counter, a bistro-type operation, a griddle or steak bar and a full Ã  la carte menu. The range of food items offered is mainly of the convenience food type but at times extends to the total fresh food items. Several brewery companies market specific pubs by the type of catering offered with a brand image, for example Big Steak as part of Allied Domecq Inns.\n\nAt the fast food end of the market, there are a number of characteristics common to many of the outlets. First, units are usually themed around a product (for example, hamburgers) a range of products (for example, fish or pizza), or products of a country (for example, Chinese, Italian). This\n\n'product' is very well marketed, for example from a themed product to decor and atmosphere, to the high and consistent standard of the product, to advertising on television, local radio and newspapers, to the container boxes for take-away items. Second, the method of food production is often partially or fully automated, often using commodities of the convenience type  (for  example,  frozen  chips,  concentrated  beverage  syrups),  and thereby de-skilling the job and restricting the product range variable. Similarly, the method of food service is simplified and basic.\n\nFunction catering is found in both the commercial and non-commercial sectors of the catering industry. In the commercial sector, function catering could be a specialist organization operating in its own function facilities or an outdoor catering specialist operating in a vast range of clients' or rented facilities or within marquees, or as a separate department within a hotel. Anyone who has visited a major sporting event cannot fail to be impressed by the scale and range of catering that takes place within the 'tented village'. Indeed some visitors seem to take more interest in the food and beverage provision than in the sports event they have been invited to attend.\n\nIn  the  non-commercial  sector,  function  catering  is  rarely  the  primary reason  for  providing  the  establishment  with  catering  facilities.  Such establishments include hospitals, schools, industrial cafeterias, etc. where the functions are not usually organized on a purely profit basis as they are in  the  commercial  sector,  but  rather  to  serve  a  specific  need  of  the organization. Typical examples would be Christmas functions, retirement parties, fund-raising events, etc.\n\n",

In England and Wales, clubs are of two main types : proprietary clubs and registered clubs.\n\nProprietary clubs are licensed clubs, owned by an individual or company and operated by themselves for profit, and as such require a justice's license to operate.

Another  growing  sector comprises sports or health clubs that offer their members sporting, fitness and leisure facilities but where food is an ancillary service.\n\nIn registered clubs the management is responsible to an elected committee. The members own all the property including the food and drink, and pay their subscriptions to a common fund. As a non-profit making club that belongs to all the members and provides a service to the members, it does not require a justice's license to operate, simply to be registered.

Despite of shrinking pool of applicants for increasing number of jobs, HR manager continued to rely on the employee referral system for his hotel. He justified this decision by saying \"Even though fewer employees are available, the employee referral method brings employees into our chain who are knowledgeable, know about our hotel and its working & as per our expectations. In the long run, these aspects will help us keep training & orientation costs down\"\n\nBut unfortunately, the referral program is failing miserably in coming years and the hotel is desperately short of staff .To acknowledge the problem, finally the management developed a new position i.e. Director of recruiting. You have been hired for this position and asked to prepare a recruitment plan those solves labour supplies problems that your hotel has been facing over the past few years.

      "title": "ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

      "content": "Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions. The  acronym  MICE  is applied inconsistently with the \"E\" sometimes referring to events and the \"C\" sometimes referring to conventions. MICE is used to refer to a particular type of tourism in which large groups, usually planned well in advance, are brought together for some particular purpose. Recently, there has been an industry trend towards using the term meetings industry to avoid confusion from the acronym. Other industry educators are recommending the use of \"Events Industry\" to be an umbrella term for the vast scope of the meeting and events profession.\n\nMost components of MICE are well understood, perhaps with the exception of incentives. Incentive tourism is usually undertaken as a type of employee reward by a company or institution for targets met or exceeded, or a job well done. Unlike the other types of MICE tourism, incentive tourism is usually conducted purely for entertainment, rather than professional or educational purposes.\n\nMICE tourism usually includes a well-planned agenda centred on a particular theme or topic, such as profession trade organization, a special interest group or an educational topic. Such tourism is often a specialized area with its own exhibition. (e.g. : IMEX, EIBTM, GIBTM, AIBTM, CIBTM and AIME) and practices. Location of MICE events are normally bid on by specialized convention bureaux located in particular countries and cities and established for the purpose of bidding on MICE activities. This process of marketing and bidding is normally conducted well in advance of the actual event, often several years. MICE tourism is known for its extensive planning and demanding clientele.\n\nLeisure, or free time, is time spent away from business, work and domestic chores. It is also the periods of time before or after necessary activities such as eating, sleeping and, where it is compulsory, education.\n\nThe distinction between leisure and unavoidable activities is loosely applied, i.e. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility. A distinction may also be drawn between free time and leisure. For example, Situations International maintains that free time is illusory and rarely free; economic and social forces appropriate free time from the individual and sell it back to them as the commodity known as \"leisure\". In this block, unit 1 discuses recreation and unit 2 takes an in depth look at meetings, incentives conventions and expositions.\n\n",

Recreation is better known as an act of diversion : an activity that diverts, amuses, refreshes or stimulates the mind, body and soul.\n\nRecreation  planning  is  a  people-oriented  process  that  brings  together information about the rational allocation of recreation and sport resources to meet the present and future requirements of people at state, regional and local level.\n\nRecreation therapy is the use of leisure activity to achieve a treatment goal. Therapeutic activities can include art, friendship development, dance, outdoor experiences, therapeutic sports, and more. Recreation therapy can be done in many different settings, such as hospitals, rehabilitation centres, nursing homes, community parks departments and independent living centres.\n\nIntroduction  to Hospitality Management\n\nOutdoor recreational activities are undertaken in a natural environment and these  activities  include  an  educational  process  that  facilitates  leadership, interpersonal and management skills. The possibilities for recreational activities in India are enormous.\n\nWhile leisure is more likely a form of entertainment or rest, recreation is active and participatory, but in a refreshing and diverting manner. As people in the world's wealthier regions lead increasingly sedentary life styles, the need for recreation  has  grown.  The  rises  of  so  called  indoor  recreational  activities exemplify this.\n\nThe amount of leisure time at the disposal of the average person has increased significantly as the workweek has shortened. Management of recreation pursuits is now a thriving business field, and trained professionals in recreation are finding many career options open to them.\n\n",

It  is  a combination of business and social science, where one can get the opportunity to study the psychology of sports alongside microeconomics and accounting.\n\nWith the continuous demand for a break from hectic lives, Recreation Management majors could find it relatively easy to land a job in this lucrative industry. As more people explore national parks or vacation at posh resorts, you will find yourself poised to provide top-notch recreational options with the business and managerial skills necessary to making whatever activity you're selling a financially worthwhile endeavour.\n\n",

It is also the period of recreational and discretionary time before or after compulsory activities such as eating and sleeping, going to work or running a business, attending school and doing homework, household chores and day-to-day stress.\n\nThe  distinction  between  leisure  and  compulsory  activities  is  loosely applied, i.e. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility. Distinction may also arise between free time and leisure. For example, criticism of consumer capitalism by the Situations International maintains that free time is illusory and rarely free and instead, economic and social forces appropriate it from the individual and sell it back to him as a commodity in the form of leisure.\n\nModern life is a busy life. The pace of life gets faster and faster every day and a man must hurry and utilize every moment of his life, otherwise he would be left behind in the race of life. But some leisure is necessary for the happiness of life. There can be no happiness for a man, unless he gets some time to pass in the way he likes best. Leisure may also be passed with great profit in the making of beautiful things. There was a time when the Indian skilled worker used to make beautiful carpets, baskets, toys, etc., in his leisure time, but now this art has been lost. Many of the Indian farmers and workers today are faced with problem of enforced leisure (unemployment) but they fail to use it rightly for the own good and for the good of society. They are advised to use their time in making traditional articles as their forefathers used to do. Similarly, the educated may take to some hobby which would both entertain them and make them more cultured. For example, they may do painting or the study of standard works of literature, more specially poetry. Gardening is another of the finest uses of leisure; the way in which a man passes his leisure is the test of his education. A really educated man would pass it in such cultural act ivies as give pleasure and lead to self- development as well Indians, generally, misuse their leisure, for the education they receive is bookish and does not make them intellectually curious. They are not eager to know and to do; they have not been educated in the real sense of the word. A leisure study is the academic discipline concerned with the study and analysis of leisure.\n\nLeisure or free time is a period of time spent out of work and essential domestic activities. It is also the period of recreational and discretionary time before or after compulsory activities such as eating and sleeping, going to work or running a business, attending school and doing homework, household chores, and day-to-day stress. Leisure activities refresh mind and brings positive flow of energy. Leisure activities are of 2 types\n\n",

While many exhibitions are shown in just one venue, some exhibitions are shown in multiple locations, such exhibitions are called travelling exhibitions.\n\nCommercial exhibitions, generally called trade fairs, trade shows or expos, are usually organized so that organizations in a specific interest or industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products; some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade) and members of the press.\n\nThe exhibition industry has also gained fresh impetus with exhibition centres like Pragati Maidan in New Delhi, the Nehru Centre in Mumbai and the Chennai Trade Centre in Chennai amongst several other options.\n\nExposition-A  trade  fair  (trade  show,  trade  exhibition  or  expo)  is  an exhibition organized so that companies in a specific industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products, service, study activities of rivals and examine recent market trends and opportunities. In contrast to consumer fairs, only some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade, e.g. professionals) and members of the press, therefore trade shows are classified as either \"Public\" or \"Trade Only\". A few fairs are hybrids of the two; one example is the Frankfurt Book Fair, which is trade-only for its first three days and open to the general public on its final two days. They are held on a continuing basis in virtually all markets and normally attract companies from around the globe.\n\nFig. 2.3 : A Picture of Frankfurt Book Fare\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Please fill in the specific requirements.\n\nIndia is undoubtedly a unique Conference Destination as it offers cultural and heritage sites, the exotic and mystical, excellent facilities of beach and adventure holidays which can be combined as pre and post conference tours.\n\nThe inbound MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and events) segment is growing at 15 to 20% annually. It is estimated that the total national and international MICE meetings market all over the world is in excess of $270 billion.  The  Infrastructure  -  India  provides  an  impressive  combination  of accommodation  and  other  conference  support  facilities  to  hold  a  successful Conference. To mention a few; Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi, Centre Point, Renaissance Hotel and Convention Centre in Mumbai, the BM Birla Science and Technology Centre in Jaipur, The Jaypee Hotels and International Convention Centre, Agra and the Cochin Convention Centre, Kochi etc together with facilities in the business hotels and resorts at various centres in the country.\n\nIndia is going the global way and MICE is fast becoming a major part of its travel and promotional budgets. In the Indian context, incentives is at present the largest component of MICE but in a maturing market, it's only a matter of time before the entire gamut of MICE activities are undertaken by the Indian corporate world. With the expansion in the network of airlines operation on the domestic routes, better tourist surface transport systems including the Indian Railways, new centres of information technology, many new convention centres, hotels and meeting facilities, India is now an important MICE destination. The Indian sub- continent is emerging as one of the finest Incentive destinations in the world owing to the diverse culture and geography. From the icy Himalayas to the tropical islands and from citadels in the desert to verdant jungles it is a world in itself. With the emergence of exciting new destinations every year one has unparalleled choices for the incentive operator here. The incentive programmes are a combination of old world charm and tradition interlaced with modern cosmopolitan sophistication.\n\nToday, there are distinct travel divisions within tour companies and airlines that exclusively target MICE movement. Destinations have also begun to market MICE products to specialised agencies and the corporate world at large. The business of MICE holds enormous potential for any country. It is estimated that a person travelling to a country for a conference or convention spends anywhere four to eight times more than a normal leisure traveller. They spend more on food, more on business centre services.\n\nIndia is globally connected to a network of over 50 international airlines and several domestic airlines, which provide convenient connectivity within India. Added to this is an elaborate network of surface transportation system. There is an excellent Railway system running through the entire country. Allimportant cities are connected with state-of-the-art 'Shatabdi and Rajdhani' Express trains. Special trains like Palace on Wheels and Royal Orient Express, comprising of air- conditioned saloons decorated in the old Maharaja Style offer guests a chance to stay on the train and visit colourful Rajasthan and fascinating Gujarat. An excellent network of roads, national and state highways, luxury coaches, Indian and imported vehicles add to the convenience and comfort of surface travel. And, to add to this, India offers an educated manpower base where fluency in English and other official international languages can be expected.\n\n",

The tourism ministry hired the services of Ogilvy & Mather (India) (O&M) to create a new campaign to increase tourist inflows into the country. The 'Incredible India' campaign, as it was named, was launched in 2002 with a series of television commercials and print advertisements. This campaign had a great impact in attracting tourists from around the world.\n\nAfter starting this new campaign, Visa Asia Pacific in March 2006, India released spending data by tourists and India is emerged as the fastest-growing market in the Asia-Pacific in terms of international tourist spending. This data disclosed that international tourists spent US$ 372 million in India in the fourth quarter (October-December) of 2005, 25% more than in the fourth quarter of 2004.
