      "content": "As Denney would tell you, the first edition of this textbook project was originally born out of  a  range  of  frustrations. While  there  are many outstanding textbooks in the hotel management field that dealt with significant portions of operations, particularly housekeeping, front office, and food and beverage, there are very few that try to treat, in a balanced and indepth way, each department in the hotel. One frustration was that some texts that dealt with these departments spent an inordinate amount of time focused on one aspect of the hotel  operations-usually  either  front  of  the house, food and beverage or marketing. Other departments, for better or worse, were treated as minor players. Consequently, students and readers of such texts were given only a cursory introduction  to  the  intricacies  of  these  'minor' departments, their  management, their people, and their interactive functions in the overall hotel organization.\n\nAnother frustration he encountered was using then currently available material to pro-\n\nmote the idea of critical thinking among students of hotel administration. Critical thinking refers to that process whereby the student is  exposed  to  a  number  of  different  viewpoints within a theoretical structure, and from analysis of those viewpoints, becomes better able to synthesize a viewpoint about hotel operations that will enable them to intelligently approach  whatever  practical  situations  they may find  themselves  confronted  with  in  the 'real world.'\n\nThere is a conventional wisdom that goes, 'something  may  be  okay  in  theory  but  it doesn't  work  in  practice.' Like  economist Milton Friedman, we reject that statement. If theory doesn't work in practice, it is lousy theory.What professors need to guide students in understanding is that theory, (in the word of Friedman) explains, predicts, or controls, and does  this  in  different  ways  given  different variables in different organizations.This is another issue or frustration that subsequent editions have been designed to further address.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we went about planning and designing the fourth edition of Hotel Management and Operations (HMO IV), we felt  the  need  to continue to remind ourselves of the lessons of the  frustrations  listed  above. We  wanted  to make sure the original idea behind this book did not get lost. By helping the reader gain an appreciation  of  what  a variety of  observers, thinkers, researchers, and commentators\n\nthink  about  a  topic, in  this  case, a  hotel  department, a student or hotel professional can feel better prepared to find ways to apply theory in a practical setting or situation. In the final analysis, it is up to you to make the best use of HMO IV, because like we state above, none of us knows it all. Good luck, it is our pleasure to do this work for you.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "I  sort  of  thought  that  by  the  time  I  reached the fourth edition, the project would have become easier. Well, it hasn't. The challenges of continual  improvement-finding  challenging and  interesting  material, presenting  it  in  interesting ways, and trying to choose material that will transcend unanticipated events-get harder, not  easier. While  making  the  book was a team effort involving a wide range of professionals, all of its flaws, and there probably  are  more  than  a  few, are  solely  my responsibility.\n\nFirst  of  all, the  authors  of  the  various pieces  included  here  who  knowingly  or  unknowingly  have  contributed  their  thoughts, research, ideas, opinions, and expertise to this exercise  in  critical  thinking  about  hotel  departmental  operations  deserve  recognition. Without the rich mixture of interest and talent extant in the hospitality profession and its educational  establishment  today, this  collection of readings would not have been possible. It is my  great  good  fortune  that  my\n\nfriends, colleagues, and former students could devote the time they did to contribute to this project. My badgering, cajoling, begging, and bribing aside, I think we're all still friends.\n\nI  want  to  particularly  salute  those  who crafted  custom  pieces  for  this  edition  and those professionals who contributed 'Day in the Life' and 'As I See It' pieces. They have made  this  edition  a  richer  and  more  userfriendly book.They also add a view of the real world that has been missing.\n\nThe  support  and  encouragement  of  my colleagues  at  Washington  State  University was  critical. Terry  Umbreit, Director  of  the School of Hospitality Business Management, and a whole bunch of students all contributed to  the  success  of  this  project  with  advice, counsel, and suggestions.\n\nMy good friend, colleague, and production assistant, Lillian  Sugahara  Jesse, helped  me tremendously. Her  magic  with  the  computer literally saved this project by translating many files created in Adobe PDF or PageMaker for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacintosh to something I could edit in Word. Because she kept accurate files of the manuscript  of  previous  editions, we  were  able  to overcome  the  problems  attendant  to  the transfer  of  the  project  from  Van  Nostrand Rinehold to John Wiley & Sons. Lillian, you are the greatest.\n\nMelissa  Oliver, my  editor  at Wiley, provided needed support regarding material previously published by Wiley, and her willingness to discuss some of my off-the-wall ideas  have  truly  made  this  a  better  project. Thanks, Melissa.\n\nMy wife and best friend, Sandy Sweeney, continues to provide the encouragement, support, and  understanding  she  always  does  on big writing projects. Her understanding is particularly important when I disappear to work on 'the book' when we could be doing other, more  fun  things. As  with  past  editions, she does  understand  the  rhythms  of  an  author's life and endures losing me to 'the book' with style and grace. The last two times I did this, we were moving-and surprise-it is happening  again. I  retired  from  Washington  State\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUniversity after 26 years in May 2004. We are in the  process  of  building  our  retirement home in Port Townsend,Washington, and will be moving in July 2005, shortly after the book is due at the publisher. Building a house long distance has its own challenges, and with 'the book,' we have had to rely on Sandy for a lot of decisions. I love you, Sandy.\n\nI  also  want  to  acknowledge  the  capable assistance  of  my  colleague  and  former  student, Michael  O'Fallon. He  is  the  author  of the  instructor's  manual. Michael  will  co-author this and the next edition, after which the project will be all his.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "L ike many other American businesses, hotels have  been  affected  by  shifts  in  emphasis\n\namong  the  country's  living  patterns. People and industry have moved from the so-called rust  belt  to  the  sun  belt. The  hotel  business has been active in reborn and reconstructed central  cities. The  explosion  of  technology and  information-based  companies  has  concentrated  human  endeavor  in  technological corridors in California, Massachusetts, Washington, Texas, and North Carolina, to name a few  such  places. It  can  be  safely  said  that where jobs  are  and  major  concentrations  of economic activity occur, hotels will follow.\n\nAmong other current and ongoing influencers of hotel design, construction, marketing, and  operation  are  the  following. Note: This list is neither exhaustive nor exclusive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nuse  people  from  outside  the  hotel  industry are now participating in its financial  structuring, hotel  operations  are  no longer dependent on the vision of a single entrepreneur. Managers now must design tactics  and  strategies  to  achieve  heretofore  unanticipated  financial  goals. The same trend has also altered the complexion  of  management  and  organization  of the  modern hotel. This is  especially  true of publicly owned hotel firms, where Wall Street  stock  analysts  heavily  influence stock prices through  expectations  of quarterly revenues and profits. This puts pressure  on  hotel  companies  and  their operations  managers  to  perform, on  a quarterly basis, in a way contrary to many managers' instincts.\n\nMost  of  the  foregoing  issues  and  influences still operate (to a greater or lesser extent)  on  the  organizational  structures  and strategies of the modern hotel. Since the last edition of this book, however, other phenomena  of  an  economic, cultural, and  social  nature have come to the fore, complicating our view of hotel management. This furthers the argument that the hotel industry is a part of the greater economy and at the mercy of elements often completely out of its control.\n\nThe cyclical nature of the U.S. and international  economies  has  recently  affected significantly  hotels'  ability  to  respond  to changing circumstances. In early 1993, for instance, employment growth was stagnant; corporate profits were low; the expansion of the gross national product (GNP) was only a marginal  percentage  above  previous  years; and travel in most segments was down due to corporate restructuring, downsizing, or reorganizing. Vast layoffs in the hundreds of thousands had been announced every month. While  fuel  prices  continued  to  be  relatively\n\nstable, consumer spending patterns and high employment  growth  had  not  materialized, particularly  in  light  of  corporate  layoffs  and the ongoing nervousness of consumers about whether  or  not  their  financial  wherewithal was safe.\n\nNow consider  late  2000, when  the  third edition of this book was being written. Unemployment  was  at  an  all-time  low; the  Dow Jones Industrial Average was between 10,000 and 11,000; hotel  occupancies  had  stabilized nationally in excess of 70 percent; and the federal government was running a surplus for the first time in the memory of most.\n\nThen  what  happened?  The  terrorist  attacks  in  New York  and Washington, D.C., in 2001  changed  the  face  of  all  business  and travel, immediately and probably for the foreseeable  future  as  well. Major  airlines  are  in bankruptcy; hotels  are  struggling  to  achieve profitable occupancies; business travel is down; the  high-tech  stock  market  bubble burst; the country is at war in a number of locations; security  has  made  travel  more  difficult, if  not  actually  annoying; and people are nervous. Join this with an imbalance of trade, the outsourcing of jobs, and the largest federal deficits in history, and the face of the economy is challenging. This translates directly not only to  business  travel  but  personal  and  recreational travel as well. Finding ways to operate profitably in such an environment is the job of the next generation of hotel operators.\n\nAmong the predictions I made in the preceding edition was that cultural diversity will play a role in the management and organizational  structure  of  the  modern  hotel  in  the United  States. As  surely  as  living  patterns, economic  cycles, and  market  segmentation have influenced the hotel industry, so will the change in ethnicity of the workforce. The cultural backgrounds that an increasingly diversified workforce will bring to hotel operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmay be seen as a problem or a challenge-or both. To most operators, it will be seen as an opportunity to demonstrate to an increasingly diverse  clientele  that  hotel  companies  are committed to hiring and training a workforce structure that mirrors society. I see no reason to change that prediction now; if anything, acculturation  of  the  hospitality  business  will accelerate.\n\nThe  legal  and  regulatory  environments are  increasingly  important  to  all  business managers, and hotel operators are no exception. Increasingly, operators must be aware of and alert to realms of risk that can engender lawsuits against them. Several articles and essays in this edition highlight these threats to hotels and their guests. It should be noted that present-day  security  concerns  also  have  significantly  affected  the  ways  in  which  hotels are operated. Awareness of the risk environment  and  the  regulatory  realm  are  factors that affect a hotel's ability to compete in the early part of the twenty-first century. Essays and articles in the security section and the human resources section address this issue.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I have  attempted  in  this  edition  to  present new and (sometimes) different takes on the hotel business. This section is also used to explore ideas that are new to the management process, and  that-who  knows?-may never completely catch on. Rather than focus exclusively on the operations of the major chains, the readings here are from the perspectives of operators, leaders, and  experts  such  as  regional operators, major industry consultants, and independent branded hotels.\n\nJohn Dew, formerly president of Inn Ventures, a  regional  hotel  management  and  development company  that has built and operated many Marriott products, in addition to a proprietary hotel product, provides an insider's view of the steps needed to bring a hotel from  conception  to  construction  and operation. This  unique  view  of  hotel  operations connects the concept of hotel development with the realities of day-to-day operation. It  should  help  aspiring  managers understand how the intricacies of the development process may influence the marketing and management of the hotel.\n\nPeter  Cass  offers  the  reader  insights, heretofore unavailable in books of this nature, into independently branded hotels that associate to provide market strength. He makes the case  that  the  future  success  of  independent hotels is linked to their ability to find ways to maintain their independence while sustaining competitive advantage in the luxury segment.\n\nBecause  new  construction  of  hotels  diminished  greatly  after  9/11  but  firms  still needed to grow, rebranding existing  properties  generated  a  lot  of  growth  activity. Rebranding is a complicated process that must be accomplished within critical time frames to coincide with marketing, financial, and operational variables.Tom Dupar is a seasoned veteran at this fascinating and important activity and has participated in rebranding operations around the world. His essay on the intricacies of rebranding was a mainstay in the previous edition  of  this  book. Today's  economic  circumstances  are  different, and  Dupar's  business  has  changed  its  focus  to  opening  new major  projects. His  piece  serves  as  a  useful companion to that of John Dew, and the two should be read together, with an eye toward comparing  Dew's  smaller  project  focus  and Dupar's large projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerhaps  proving  the  axiom  that  'everything old is new again,' the concept of health and wellness spas as a hotel and resort product  has  enjoyed  a  resurgence. Once  the province  of  high-end  hotels  and  resorts, the idea  of  being  pampered  in  a  spa  has  been added to the service mix in many more modest  hotels  and  resorts. While  the  big-name spas  at  five-star  properties  still  set  the  standard for pampering and pricing, the comfort of personal service in less lavish spas seems to appeal to the modern traveler as well. Peter Anderson's overview of the spa industry provides  insights  into  this  fascinating  service product.\n\nIn addition to products, building, and rebranding, I have also chosen to include in the section  two  recently  reviewed  and  studied ideas that may or may not be adopted across the industry.\n\nAt the end of this section are a number of\n\nsuggested readings for the student who would like to gain more in-depth knowledge about the  hospitality  industry  as  a  whole  and  specific  historical  antecedents. In  particular, the books by Hilton and Jarman look closely at the intermachinations of the establishment by two  early  pioneers  of  the  industry, one  of whom, Conrad Hilton, lives on in an international, publicly traded company operated by one of his sons. E.M. Statler's contributions to the  modern  hotel  business  are  legendary  in that  he  is  generally  credited  with  founding and operating the first commercial hotel concept that recognized the realities of the early business traveler at the beginning of the twentieth century. The  suggested  articles  are drawn from recently published historic overviews of the hotel side of the hospitality industry in the United States. They also highlight other major forces in the development of the modern hotel business.\n\n",

      "content": "T he  developer  is  the  entrepreneur, the  risk taker, who originates the idea for the hotel. Depending on the business structure selected, the developer often puts his or her personal wealth at  risk  when  engaging  in  a  hotel  project. The developer, along with a small staff of people, networks  with  commercial  real  estate  agents on  the  lookout  for  a  suitable  hotel  site. Depending on the type of hotel to be developed, a site of at least two to four acres is required (for comparison, an  acre  is  roughly  the  size  of  a football field). This property must be zoned by the city for a hotel, be visible from a freeway or major street arterial, and have city approval for such  construction  activities  as  curb  cuts, lefthand  turn  lanes, and  delivery  truck  access. Commercial realtors offer sites for the developer's  consideration  that  include  maps, aerial photos, and proof of hotel zoning.\n\nSometimes the developer views potential sites by  driving  around  the  neighborhood within five miles of the site or touring multiple sites by helicopter, noting where the potential guests  live and  work  and  where potential competing hotels are located.\n\nThe price  per  square  foot  of  the  land  is considered. The  higher  the  cost  of  land, the higher the rates the hotel will need to charge. Is the price too high for the average daily rate (ADR)  in  this  particular  market?  Is  it  too low? Or is it acceptable? This is determined when  the  hotel  financial  pro  forma  budget document is created.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he City Development Commission in a Pacific Northwest community purchased a 1.55acre parcel of riverfront land in the downtown area.The land was previously contaminated  with  industrial  pollutants  that made  the  parcel  unsafe  for  habitation  and construction. The  City  Development  Commission used state, local, and federal grants to have the land decontaminated, created a master plan for the area, and then offered the parcel for sale and development.\n\nThe  City  Development  Commission  issued a request for proposal (RFP) that outlined  the  asking  price  of  $2,076,240  ($30/sq. ft.) for the land and the design requirements set  down  by  the  Commission  for  a  building that  would fit  the  intended  look  and  feel  of\n\nthe area.The RFP was sent to many major hotel companies  and  commercial  real  estate brokers, asking prospective buyers to submit a purchase price bid along with a statement of the buyer's development history and ability to develop a hotel of the type envisioned by the Commission. It listed a closing date by which all bids had to be submitted.\n\nAn  area  commercial  real  estate  broker contacted a hotel development and management company with a long history of developing and managing extended-stay hotels in the  Pacific  Northwest, including  a  property located in a similar setting to that being offered for sale.The commercial realtor offered to  represent  the  developer  in  negotiations with  the  City  Development  Commission, which would be paying the real estate commission  on  the  sale. An  agreement  was reached with the commercial real estate broker to represent the buyer to the seller, and the  developer  went  to  work  in  preparing  a proposal.\n\nThe  developer  conducted  a  feasibility study to see all of the conditions in the marketplace  that  would  be  encouraging  or  discouraging to this development project. Studies  were  conducted  to  estimate  how many  room-nights  were  being  sold  within  a five-mile  radius, how  many  extended-stay room-nights  were  available  in  the  market, how  many  hotel  rooms  existed, and  how many were being planned over the following five years. From this, the developer was able to  estimate  the  number  of  extended-stay room-nights available needed to produce an 82  percent  occupancy  with  an  average  daily room  rate  of  $141  when  the  hotel  achieved stabilization  three  years  after  opening. That provided  the  basis  for  a  ten-year  revenue estimate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe developer proposed a nine-floor, 258suite extended-stay hotel with an indoor pool, spa, and exercise facility, a guest laundry, offices, meeting  facilities, and  a  three-floor parking garage with parking for 193 automobiles, all  at  a  total  cost  of  $38  million, or $147,286 per suite.\n\nThe $38 million construction budget was broken down as follows:\n\nThe opening date for the hotel was projected at 27 months from the date of proposal acceptance.\n\nThe City Development Commission awarded  the  project  to  the  developer, and work began.\n\nFirst, an ownership limited liability company (LLC) was formed as the ownership entity that would hold title to the hotel.\n\nThe LLC, in turn, entered into a development  and  construction  management  agreement  with  the  development  company  to manage the  arrangements  for  financing  and construction of the hotel.\n\nThe developer, as agent for the ownership LLC, also entered into a hotel management contract  with  a  management  company  to manage  the  pre-opening  marketing, preopening hiring and training, and the day-to-\n\nday  operation  of  the  hotel  once  it  was opened.The arrangements called for the management company to be paid 3 percent of revenue  and  2  percent  of  the  net  operating income for management services.\n\nThe ownership LLC then contacted a major hotel company and applied for a franchise to allow the development and operation of an extended-stay hotel. A 20-year franchise was granted  with  a  fee  of  $400  per  suite  or, $102,800. This was to be followed by a 5 percent  royalty  and  a  3  percent  advertising  fee once the hotel was open and operating.\n\nThe  developer, acting  as  agent  for  the owner, prepared a private placement memorandum document seeking investments from accredited investors.These investors were primarily defined as people with a net worth of $1 million, or those with an income in excess of $200,000 over the previous two years and expecting an income in excess of $200,000 in the  current  year. ( Note: Additional  entities may also be defined as accredited investors by the Securities and Exchange Commission.)\n\nThe  private  placement  memorandum  offered  $100,000  units  of  ownership  to  accredited investors, guaranteeing a 9 percent priority return on the investment and a combined 50 percent ownership in the hotel.A group of initial investors retained the other 50 percent in exchange for putting the project together. This effort  was  successful  in  raising  40  percent  of the total cost of the hotel in anticipation that a lender would provide the remaining 60 percent in the form of a construction loan. In addition to the priority return, investors could expect to participate in any future capital gain realized should the hotel be sold.\n\nThe  development  company, continuing to  function  as  agent  for  the  owner, then sought a commercial bank to provide threeyear  construction  financing  for  the  project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs $22,800,000, or 60 percent, of the $38 million  development cost was to be borrowed, only major banks were considered as prospective lenders. The size of the construction  loan  was  above  the  lending  limits  of most  small  regional  banks. After  a  preconstruction appraisal by a third-party appraisal firm  chosen  by  the  lender  confirmed  the value at $38 million upon completion of construction, and  for  an  origination  fee  of $400,000, a three-year construction loan was secured. The terms allowed the developer, as agent for the owner, to draw down the loan every  30  days  after  providing  proof  that funds  had  been  properly  disbursed  in  the construction process.The loan documents set an  interest  rate  and  also  required  that  the ownership LLC seek a permanent mortgage prior  to  the  three-year  expiration  date  on the construction loan.\n\nThe  development  company  then  negotiated  with  and  selected  a  general  contractor with significant hotel construction experience who  acted  on  behalf  of  the  developer, as agent  for  the  owner. The  general  contractor then selected design-build subcontractors and an  interior  designer  to  select  colors, fabrics, furniture, fixtures, and equipment to meet the hotel franchise design requirements.\n\nBuilding  permits  were  applied  for, and the building design was presented to the City Development  Commission  for  its  approval, along  with  other  groups  with  a  stake  in  the appearance  of  the  finished  building  in  relation to the area and neighborhood.With all of these  approvals  in  place, construction  commenced,and the hotel opened two years later.\n\n▶\n\n",

An appraisal that was primarily  based  on  the  hotel's  trailing  12month  net  operating  income  produced  a value  about  $2  million  below  the  original construction  cost. The  bank  that  had  provided  the  construction  loan  notified  the owners  that  they  did  not  wish  to  provide permanent  financing  under  these  circumstances.

Lenders, believing that an established brand provided greater economies of scale and established infrastructure, opted for the lower-risk alternative. In  this  brand-driven  environment, the independent hotels' distinctive style and character  became  a  competitive  advantage, but only if they were able to meet recognized standards.

The  cost  to  compete  against chains will grow exponentially.As competition intensifies, it  is  probable  that  local  and  regional market share at independent hotels and resorts will be drawn off by local and regional licensees of strong global brands. Independent hotels, therefore, need to draw more national and  international  business  to  fill  occupancy gaps. This requirement runs counter to the established  business  model  and  capabilities  of reservation affiliations.\n\nThe  average  room-night  contribution  of reservations  companies  to  affiliated  inde-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npendent hotels is less than 5 percent of available rooms (Preferred Research).\n\nAt  least  four  emerging  factors  are  challenging the effectiveness of traditional reservation organizations:\n\nThe  traditional  reservation  affiliations must  change  not  only  their  focus  but  also their structure if they want to succeed in this new competitive world.\n\nThe  traditional  reservation  organization must be prepared to respond to competitive challenges by expanding resources and skills\n\nnecessary  to  increase  average  room-night contribution to affiliated independent hotels to 15 percent-an average growth per member hotel of at least 200 percent over present performance levels (Preferred Research).\n\nIn  response  to  this  competitive  environment and the need for more cooperative and focused  business  relationships, a  new  hospitality  business  structure  is  evolving  for  all scales  of  hotels: the  branded  distribution company.\n\n",

Instead, funds are  used  to  build  and  maintain  an  up-todate  global  distribution  network  and  infrastructure  composed  of  telecommunications, e-commerce functions, reservations software, data  warehousing  capability, and  sales  and marketing. The efficiency of the operation is assured by a focus that is almost entirely on the most important part of this business relationship-the generation of brand awareness and measurable room-night revenue for each affiliated hotel or resort.\n\nUnlike  hard  flags, which  focus  primarily on  hotel  operations  and  asset  management such as the Marriott or the Westin, and reservation affiliations, which focus on professional camaraderie and traditional distribution channels such as the Best Western, the branded distribution company is primarily marketfocused; its full attention is on customer and travel influencer communication, relationship technology, and revenue streams. ( Note: Travel influencers  are  the  intermediaries  between consumers and the travel product and include travel agents, etc.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn contrast, asset management, profitability, and  operating  efficiency  are  the  major concerns  of  management  companies, which tend to be public companies with stockholder expectations that must be met. It is often the case  that  strategic  asset  management  concerns conflict with day-to-day tactical operating needs. This is evident in Marriott's recent move to separate its ownership and operating divisions, to the benefit of both.\n\nThe same conflict can arise between the independent owners of a hotel property, who are focused on real estate concerns, and the management company they hire. Such misunderstandings can sour what should be a mutually supportive  relationship. The  fact  that management  contract  fees  are  charged  and collected, even when the cash flow is negative, does not create owner confidence in the partner. A franchise relationship can cause a similar conflict and put a financial and operating burden on an owner.\n\nIn contrast, participation of independent owner/operators as shareholders in a branded distribution  company enables them to move beyond these concerns and focus on their operation  and  the  consumer-the  source  of their revenue and the basis of their success.\n\n",

The role of an OPM is to pull together the  visions  of  the  architect, interior  designer, owner, operator, and  others. When  these  visions are successfully melded, the hotel guest is satisfied, the owner makes money, and the architect and interior designer can add the project to their list of successful accomplishments.\n\nThe OPM oversees the following aspects of a project:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

The list of goods typically exceeds 2,500 line items. Add a little more for a full-service resort; deduct  a  little  for  an  in-city  business hotel.\n\nThe OS&E comprises all of the items that are not nailed down, with the exception of the furniture, fixtures, and  equipment  (FF&E). The FF&E is typically specified and ordered by the interior designer.\n\nTypical guest room items include bedding (frames, box  springs, mattresses, mattress pads, sheets, pillows, pillowcases, towels, etc.), clock  radios, hangers, laundry  bags, laundry tickets, iron, ironing board, ironing board organizer, luggage rack, guest amenities (soap, shampoo, lotion, etc.), hair dryer, shower curtains, and shower curtain hooks.\n\nHousekeeping equipment includes vacuums (guest room and wide-area units), carpet shampooers, carpet  extractors, housekeeper carts, laundry bins, garbage trucks, valet delivery carts, and shelving, to name a few of many items. Housekeeping  must  also  keep  an  inventory of guest request items including humidifiers, dehumidifiers, cribs, high  chairs, rollaway beds, bedboards, spare pillows, towels, amenities, refrigerators, laundry soap, and so on.\n\nFood  and  beverage  front-of-the-house items  include  flatware  (knives, forks, and spoons), hollowware  (serving  trays, serving utensils, chafing dishes, sugar bowls and sauce\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nboats, punch  bowls), glassware, table  linen, napkins, skirting, salt and  pepper  shakers, china, plate covers, espresso machines, menu covers and the list goes on and on.\n\nBanquet  items  include  all  of  the  above plus  tables, chairs, staging, staging  steps  and railings, dance floors, carts, carving boards, ice carving trays, flags, podiums, portable bars, ice bins, pianos, and tray jack stands.\n\nThe  largest  purchase  order-typically over  100  pages  long-is  for  a  full-service kitchen and includes everything a chef needs to produce the menus being sold at the hotel.

My recent Kona, Hawaii, project uniform purchase order was 68 pages long.The invoices covered over 100 pages!\n\nBefore quantifying uniform needs, many questions are asked. Do we need summer and winter uniforms? Will the uniforms be laundered  by  the  hotel  or  the  hotel  associates? How many extra servers are needed for a capacity  dinner  function  in  the  ballrooms?  Is the intent to have a large percentage of parttime staff? Which uniforms need custom embroidery  (restaurants, culinary, engineering, etc.)? What percentage of spare uniforms are needed in reserve?\n\nOnce these questions are answered, then the selection process begins. Operations and the interior designer review the look and feel the  options  available. Each  position  (housekeeper, bellperson, etc.)  or  similar  position (front desk clerk/concierge) has different requirements. Housekeepers  and  bellpersons require  durable  uniforms  that  breathe  and can handle lots of bending and stretching.The uniforms  of  the  culinary  and  engineering staffs  are  often  stained  and must hold up to numerous launderings.\n\nThe  uniform  order  is  placed  90  to  120 days before the first uniformed staff is hired. To quantify the sizes required, a typical bell chart  sizing  curve  is  used  for  the  particular country or region of the hotel. The uniforms are delivered and sorted prior to the individual fitting process. On the line staff's second day  on  the  job, each  individual  is  measured for  uniforms. An  army  of  seamstresses  then takes the pants, jackets, and dresses and alters each piece for each associate. The fitted uniforms  are  issued  a  few  days  before  opening day.\n\n",

      "content": "Peter O'Connor\n\nThe  importance  of  electronic  hotel-distribution routes has grown substantially in recent years. According  to  statistics  quoted  in  the Horwath Worldwide Hotel Industry Studies, direct reservations fell from approximately 39 percent in 1995 to 33 percent in 1999, with the\n\nshift in sales going almost exclusively to electronic  channels  (O'Connor, 2001, 70-93). While hotels continue to make extensive use of  travel-agent-oriented  global  distribution systems  (GDSs), consumer  adoption  of  the Internet  as  a  reliable  and  secure  commerce\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmedium has prompted a change in the way in which hotel rooms are being distributed.\n\nThe  Internet  has  dramatically  changed the way people communicate, research information, and  buy  goods  and  services. Travel products in particular have proven to be suitable  for  sale  on  line. The  typical  Internet user-an  affluent, frequent  traveler  who spends more than the average on leisure and entertainment-is  an  attractive  market  for travel suppliers (NFO Plog Research, 2000). Furthermore, from a consumer's perspective purchasing  travel  products  on  line  has, in many  instances, become  faster, easier, and more  convenient  than  contacting  a  travel agent or telephoning a supplier directly. As a result, on-line  travel-related  revenues  are forecast to grow sharply. For example, according  to  a  recent  report  by  Jupiter  Media Metrix, on-line  travel  sales  will  more  than triple in the next five years-from US$18 billion in 2002 to US$64 billion in 2007 (Jupiter Media Metrix, 2001).\n\nBooking  volumes  are  also  forecast  to climb. The  Travel  Industry  Association  of America (TIAA) estimated that by the end of 2002 between 6 percent and 10 percent of all travel  reservations  would  originate  on  the web  (TIAA, 1998). If  Jupiter's  2007  prediction comes true, travel will be the biggest selling  on-line  product, with  a  volume  nearly double  that  of  the  current  leading  product, PC hardware (Forrester Research).\n\nPrice is key to selling successfully on line. Studies  by  Internet  analysts  Gomez  and PhoCusWright, and also a study by TIAA, all identified price as being one of the key motivating  factors  that  encourages  consumers  to purchase  travel  on  line  (Gomez.com, 2000; PhoCuSWright,2001;TIAA,2001).For example, the PhoCusWright study found that competitive  pricing  is  the  best  way  to  attract customers  (Pastore, 2001). When  travelers\n\nwho haven't bought on line were asked what would  encourage  them  to  do  so, 64  percent said  that  saving  money  would  make  them more interested. No  other  benefit-whether saving time, getting bonus loyalty-club points, more  control, or  obtaining  better  information-came close to this level of response.\n\n",

      "content": "Y esawich, Pepperdine, and Brown found in a 2000 study that almost six out of ten leisure travelers now actively seek the 'lowest possible price' for travel services (Yesawich, Pepperdine, and  Brown, 2000). Similarly, a  2001 Forrester Research study found that 66 percent  of  all  buyers  had  used  an  on-line  discount in the previous 12 months to buy travel on  line  (Forrester  Research, 2001), and  a study by the Joint Hospitality Industry Congress  found  a  real  expectation  among  consumers  that  Internet  prices  would  be  lower than those available in the 'bricks and mortar' world  (Joint  Hospitality  Industry  Congress, 2000).\n\nSuch a perception has developed for several reasons. First, many of the best-known Internet retailers (such as, for example, Amazon.com)  initially  competed  with  traditional outlets based, to a large extent, on price. Second, savvy consumers are aware that webbased distribution costs are lower than those of  other channels (Nua, 1998). As Jack Geddes, Radisson  Hotels  Worldwide's  managing director, sales and marketing Asia, has pointed out: 'Consumers now understand that suppliers are cutting costs through this channel and expect savings to be passed on to them, as well as  being  rewarded  for  making  the  booking themselves' (Muqbil, 1998). Such expectations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nare being reinforced by the budget-airline sector, which offers substantial discounts for online  bookings. Companies  such  as  EasyJet, RyanAir, and Buzz estimate that by avoiding telesales  and  travel  agents, they  can  achieve savings of up to 30 percent-which they pass on  to  customers  in  the  form  of  lower  fares (Cooke, 2000). Similar or even greater levels of savings can be made by hotel companies, as can be seen from the internal Accor figures in Table  1.2, which  show  how  an  80-  to  90percent savings in transaction charges can be achieved  by  selling  directly  to  the  consumer on line. Finally, many hotels (and airlines) use the web to sell last-minute deals-packages at relatively low prices but with short lead times. While  such  promotions  can  help  dispose  of unsold  inventory, they  have  also  resulted  in the  public's  associating  rooms  sold  over  the Internet with lower prices.\n\nThese  factors  have  combined  to  make consumers  associate  on-line  booking  with good  value, which  in  the  consumer's  mind translates  into  low  prices. However, in  the case of hotel brands' own web sites, industry practice frequently seems to be the opposite of theory. In a 1999 survey, for instance, a colleague and I found that rates obtained from the web site were usually substantially higher than those obtained by contacting the central reservations  office  (O'Connor  and  Horan, 1999). That  study  was  limited, however, in that it focused only on direct sales over hotel chains'  own  branded  web  sites. Electronic distribution is rapidly evolving for hotels, and a  large  number  of  other  on-line  consumerfocused  channels  are  now  available, with most  chains  using  multiple  routes  to  reach the consumer  (Castleberry et al., 1998, 19-24).\n\nTable 1.2 Reservation Cost by Distribution Channel\n\nSource: Dresdner Kleinwort Benson/Accor, quoted in Travel and Tourism Intelligence, The\n\nInternational Hotel Industry: Corporate Strategies and Global Opportunities (London: Economic Intelligence Unit, 2001).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  availability  of  numerous  points  of sale  poses  some  interesting  questions. Foremost among these is: Is there consistency between the room availability and prices being offered over each of the channels? Unlike in the  physical  world, where  a  potential  customer would have to telephone or visit several  suppliers, comparison  shopping  on  the web can generally be accomplished relatively quickly. Research has shown that consumers shopping  for  travel  on  line  almost  always check more than one site before purchasing. According  to  Jupiter  Media  Metrix  (2001), just  10  percent of would-be guests visit only one site to book a hotel room, another 43 percent  visit  two  or  three  sites, and  22  percent visit  four  or  more  sites. Because  they  check prices  in  several  places, on-line  purchasers have become increasingly intolerant of inconsistent  information, and  may  react  unfavorably  to  a  firm's  disparate  rates  by  booking with  the  company's  competitor. Two  related questions, then, are:\n\nIn  this  paper, I seek  to  answer  those questions.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "P revious studies of hotels' Internet use have been limited. Murphy et al. (1996, 70-82) focused on rating the content of hotel web sites, while Van Hoof and Combrink (1998, 46-54) attempted to measure managers' perceptions\n\nof  and  attitudes  toward  the  Internet. Webreservations facilities were investigated in detail in the co-authored paper that I mentioned above  (O'Connor  and  Horan, 1999). However, the  issue  of  pricing  over  several  distribution channels does not appear to have been the  subject  of  extensive  systematic  research to date. The objective of this study, therefore, was to analyze the room rates being offered to consumers over multiple electronic distribution channels.\n\nAn exhaustive analysis of the rates being offered by all hotels would be virtually impossible. Those  rates  are  constantly  in  flux, as hoteliers project occupancy rates and open or close  rate  classes  accordingly  (according  to yield-management principles). I believe, however, that  major  international  hotel  chains' electronic-distribution activities are indicative of  industry  patterns, because  recent  research has shown that large companies are most active  on  the  web-perhaps  because  their  size often  gives  them  an  advantage  in  terms  of technical expertise and financial resources. As a  result, I  decided  to  focus  this  study  on  the behavior  of  the  top-50  international  hotel brands. While  this  strategy  means  that  the findings are not representative of the industry as  a  whole  (and, therefore, not generally applicable), it does allow establishment of an accurate benchmark of trends as they currently stand. The  companies  were  chosen  based  on the  ranking  of  the  top-50  hotel  brands  published in Hotels magazine in July 2000. Two of those companies (Disney and Club Med) were removed from the listing because they operate resorts  and  distribute  their  rooms  largely  as part of packages, which means that their products are not directly comparable to the rest of the industry. Furthermore, another three companies neither offered on-line reservations on their own web site nor were they listed on any of the other channels studied.Thus, the results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndiscussed below reflect the findings from the 45  hotel  brands  for  which  consistent  data could be found.\n\nFive  major  types  of  electronic  businessto-consumer distribution channels were identified from the literature, and leading examples of each category were selected for inclusion in the study. In addition to a chain's own web site (e.g., www.marriott.com), these comprised channels that draw their data and reservations engine from the GDS (i.e., Expedia and Travelocity); those that are based on the  databases  and  reservation  engine  of  the switch  companies  (namely, Travelweb); and pure  web-based  channels  with  an  inventory and reservations database that is maintained on line (i.e., WorldRes).While not collectively exhaustive, these  represent  the  majority  of hotel-reservation  sites. Omitted  from  the study were the auction-style web sites, such as Priceline.com, which  are  not  comparable  to typical booking approaches.\n\nAs another point of comparison, I incorporated voice channels into the study by analyzing  the  rates  offered  by  the  toll-free number  to  the  central  reservations  service (CRS). Data were collected by repeatedly offering to reserve a standard double room for specified  dates  in  a  selected  property  from each of the brands using each of the distribution  channels  discussed  above. Where  the product  requested  was  available  on  the  system, both the number of rates displayed and the  lowest  rate  available  were  recorded  for analysis. To help ensure consistency, I ignored rates not available to the general public (e.g., corporate, military, AARP, and  AAA), and analyzed  only  those  rates  that  could  be booked by a 'normal' customer.After checking the web sites, I telephoned the hotel company's CRS to request the same booking. In that case, I recorded only the first rate quoted\n\nby the agent, and I did not ask for a lower rate (nor did I record any subsequent offers after I  demurred from making a reservation). Although better rates could probably be achieved by haggling, I decided that negotiating would leave no systematic way of consistently determining the lowest rate, depending as  it  does  on  the  caller's  persistence. The above process was repeated for five sets of alternative dates to reduce the possibility of error  due  to  system  malfunctions  or  other exceptional circumstances.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A s  can  be  seen  from Table  1.3, each  of  the major hotel brands uses multiple simultaneous  distribution  channels. The  most  commonly available channels were voice (via the company's CRS) and electronic (through the company's corporate web site). The company that  did  not  make  a  CRS  number  available was  in  the  economy  sector. Offering  hotel rooms via the company web site is almost universal, all but one of the brands surveyed offering on-line reservations in this manner. It is interesting to note that this represents a considerable  advancement  when  compared  to surveys  made  only  a  few  years  ago, which found that only approximately 50 percent of the  major  hotel  companies  provided  on-line reservations (O'Connor and Horan; Hensdill, 1998).\n\nAs  shown  in Table  1.3, hotel  companies make less use of the other channels investigated. Approximately four-fifths of the major brands  used  the  GDS-based  intermediaries Expedia and Travelocity, three-quarters used Travelweb, and barely one-third used World-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 1.3 Channels Used by Major Hotel Brands ( n = 45)\n\nRes.These findings are not in themselves surprising. Both  Expedia  and  Travelocity  draw their data from the GDSs, where the majority of the hotel brands represented in this study (being  major  hotel  companies)  can  reasonably expect to be represented. Similarly, Travelweb  draws  its  data  from  THISCO  (The Hotel  Industry  Switching  Company), and thus any of the hotel brands that use this as their switch service could be expected to  make  inventory  available  for  sale  via Travelweb.\n\nI  found  the  chains'  low  usage  of WorldRes surprising. With the exception of a company's own web site, using WorldRes has the lowest  potential  transaction  cost  and  thus would appear to be an attractive channel for use  by  hotel  companies. Examination  of  its property database reveals a large percentage of independent  hotels, bed-and-breakfast inns, and  small  hotel  chains. An  unresolved question is why the major brands do not exploit this distribution channel.\n\n",

      "content": "E ach of the electronic channels offered multiple rates. As can be seen from Table 1.4, each channel presented an average of five rates in\n\nresponse to the request, with more being offered to the customer by Travelocity than by the other channels surveyed.\n\nPresenting  a  variety  of  rates  to  the  customer has both positive and negative implications. From  a  positive  perspective, it  offers choices to potential customers, allowing them to match their needs with the products being sold. On  the  other  hand, presenting  a  large number of rates without adequate differentiation  between  products  can  confuse  customers  regarding  what  they  are  getting  for their money. This is best demonstrated by an example  encountered  in  the  study, where  a property offered 17 different rates for a particular  date  on Travelweb, with  few  (if  any) discernible  differences  in  the  room  descriptions. Clearly such a scenario would be confusing and  frustrating for any  customer wishing to book that property.\n\nMean  prices. It  was  difficult  to  make  a general observation about which of the several  channels  is  consistently  least  expensive on  average, although  Expedia's  rates  were marginally lower than those offered by other channels and WorldRes seemed to offer consistently higher rates than did the others (see Table  1.5). Indeed, all things  considered, prices across each of the channels were comparable-with  the  average  price  for  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 1.4 Number of Rates Offered to the Customer\n\nrequested room being in the range of US$163. It  was  interesting  that  Expedia's  mean  rates were  lower, because  as  an  on-line  travel agency, it has a high distribution cost, and it would be logical to assume that rates offered over  this  channel  would  reflect  the  higher costs. By  the  same  token, since  WorldRes's transaction costs are relatively low in comparison with those offered by the other channels surveyed, hotels could potentially offer cheaper  rates  over  this  channel. In  other words, what I found is that when selling hotel products on line, there does not appear to be a  relationship  between  the  cost  of  using  the distribution channel and the rate offered. Illogically, the  electronic  channels  with  the highest transaction costs for the hotel seem to regularly offer the best value to the customer.\n\nAs will be discussed below, hoteliers need to rethink their current practices and take action if they are to benefit from the increasing market for on-line hotel-room sales.\n\nSegment breakout. The foregoing discussion  was  based  on  an  overall  look  at  hotelroom sales distribution. If the brands studied are  subdivided  into  classifications  based  on their  targeted  market  segment, a  different picture  emerges. As  can  be  seen  from Table 1.6, hotels at the low end of the market are far more likely to offer consistent rates across all channels  used. While  it  could  be  speculated that  the  reason  for  this  might  be  that  economy properties are more likely to have a single  fixed  price  for  their  product  irrespective of demand, it could also be due to a more consistent pricing strategy on the part of the ho-\n\nTable 1.5 Average Rates Offered to the Customer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 1.6 Market Sector Analysis (Lowest Rates)\n\n*Indicates that the association is significant at the 95-percent confidence level.\n\ntel companies involved when addressing a relatively price-sensitive market. Furthermore it can be seen that consumers at the low ends of the market are far more likely to obtain low rates through direct (company-owned) channels. For  economy  brands, direct  sales  over the  company's own web site were lowest 26 percent of the time.When coupled with the 46 percent  of  cases  where  the  same  rate  is  offered  irrespective  of  the  channel  used, that means that a consumer reserving an economy room will find the cheapest rate on the hotel company's web site nearly three times out of four.With mid-price products, the chain's web site is even more likely to give the best rate, offering  the  lowest  rate  nearly  half  of  the time.\n\nThe situation is different at the upper end of the market. Luxury-hotel companies' web sites  gave  the  cheapest  rate  in  less  than  10 percent  of  cases. Furthermore, Table  1.7 shows that the company's web site quoted the highest rate in over one-third of cases. Overall, the evidence seems to indicate that if you want to stay in up-market hotels, you should\n\navoid  booking  on  these  hotels'  web  sites  if you are searching for good value. Instead, the on-line  intermediaries  (in  particular, Expedia)  offer  the  highest  probability  of  finding the  best  rate  available  for  high-end  properties, with  an  average  savings  of  5  percent available by booking through Expedia rather than on the company's own site.\n\nHaggling  required. It  is  also  clear  from the  data  that  a  hotel  company's  CRS  is  not the  place  to  obtain  the  best  rates, at  least  if one takes the first offer as I did for this study. Irrespective of the market segment, there is a higher probability of being quoted the highest rate  through  this  channel, and  bookings through  this  route  were  almost  never  the cheapest available.This finding, however, is to a large extent driven by my methodology. Indeed, in  many  cases, as  soon  as  I  indicated that I did not plan to make a booking at the quoted  rate, the  CRS  associate  quoted  another, lower rate. This anecdotal finding suggests that negotiation might have resulted in lower  prices. (This  is  a  longstanding  CRS practice; see Lewis and Roan, 1986).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 1.7 Market Sector Analysis (Highest Rates)\n\n*Indicates that the association is significant at the 95-percent confidence level.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "F rom the above discussion, it can be seen that both the range of channels through which hotels can be booked and the complexity of such channels have grown. This study represents a first  attempt  at  documenting  hotel  companies' pricing practices over electronic routes. The study revealed that the majority of hotel brands now use simultaneous, multiple electronic  channels  of  distribution, making  their rooms available to a relatively wide audience. While the use of CRS-based reservations has fallen slightly, there has been a growth in the availability  of  hotel  companies'  own  web sites, and a vast majority of companies that I studied  now  make  their  rooms  available  for sale in this manner. The differences between this study's findings and earlier published research  indicate  a  major  expansion  in  hotel chains'  use  of  the  web  as  a  direct-sales medium, perhaps accompanied by a realization of the web's benefits in comparison with other, more traditional, electronic channels of distribution.\n\nMost  companies  offer  multiple  rates  to\n\ncustomers over each channel. It is interesting to note, however, the large number of companies  that  now  offer  consistent  pricing  across all channels. Previous  research  found  less than 10 percent of companies had consistent pricing  and  cited  the  lack  of  integration among the various inventory databases used to manage inventory as a possible cause. Yet over one-third of the brands I studied now offer  consistent  pricing  across  multiple  channels, indicating  progress  in  the  industry's management of electronic distribution.\n\nAlthough  no  single  channel  consistently offers the lowest prices, in-depth analysis does reveal a link between pricing and the market being  targeted. First, the  lowest  prices  can rarely be obtained from the CRS (absent negotiation), irrespective of market segment.As compared  to  the  first-offered  CRS  price, a would-be customer can save at least 5 percent by booking over any of the electronic channels I examined. From the data it can be seen that  consumers  are  more  likely  to  find  the lowest  prices  on  the  hotel  chains'  own  web sites in the economy and mid-price segments than  will  be  found  from  those  companies'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCRS  or  third-party  web  sites. So-called  upmarket hotel brands are, on the other hand, more  likely  to  quote  higher  prices  on  their own web site than what they offer on other channels. Economy  brands  seem  to  be  the only ones in the industry as a whole displaying a logical on-line pricing strategy (in terms of the relationship between the cost of using a channel and the rates offered there) and also in terms of actively managing their channels of distribution.\n\nImplications. First, it is clear that for those with  a  taste  for  upscale  products, the  hotel brand's own web site is not the place to shop, as better value can be obtained in most cases through  other  channels. More  interesting, however, is  the  fact  that, in  general, prices have become more or less equal across many of the channels investigated, and by implication, across many other electronic distribution channels  as  well. It  is  well  established  that time is a valuable commodity in today's society. Since the number and variety of ways that a  consumer  can  book  a  hotel  room  has  become  undeniably  manifold, the  cost  associated  with  searching  through  even  a  small number of the many consumer-focused channels currently available in the marketplace in an attempt to find a low price has increased. Given that this study has found that many of the rates being offered over alternative channels are more or less the same for many hotels, customers should reconsider whether all that time and energy searching for the lowest rate is actually worthwhile.\n\nThe implications for the hotelier are more pressing. My findings suggest that many hotel chains  are  not  actively  managing  the  room rates being offered in their portfolio of electronic distribution channels. Most companies offer multiple rates on each channel, which, as discussed earlier, can be beneficial as it gives a  choice  to  the  customer. Displaying  too\n\nmany  rates, though, can  be  counterproductive, if  the  customer  becomes  overwhelmed. Presenting a small number of tightly defined rates would be the most appropriate solution. However, most  companies  currently  display about five rates in response to a customer inquiry, with others showing significantly more, usually with little or no apparent product differentiation. In addition, there appears to be inconsistency in terms of the rates being offered over electronic channels. In many cases, no clear  or  logical  pricing  strategy  is  apparent. The lowest prices are offered on channels with  the  highest  transaction  costs, and  vice versa. A  small  number  of  companies  offer consistent pricing irrespective of the channel being used to make the booking. Informal follow  up  with  those  companies  revealed  that they follow this strategy as they believe in the principle of one 'correct' price for each customer. In this way, they do not have to address the issue of customer dissatisfaction as a result of a person's being quoted a lower price for a room on a different channel after having already  made  a  booking. However, such  an approach ignores the issue of the cost of processing a booking over a particular channel. As  was  discussed  earlier, such  costs  vary greatly  depending  to  a  large  extent  on  the number  of  intermediaries  between  the  supplier and the customer. The greater the number of intermediaries, the greater the transaction  cost  and  processing  fees-and therefore  the  greater  the  distribution  cost. This  would  seem  to  argue  for  having  high rates  on  the  channels  that  have  high-cost structures and low prices on those with lowcost  structures. Coupled  with  this  matter  is the  fact  that  customers  have  become  more knowledgeable  about  and  comfortable  with e-commerce issues in general, are more aware that distribution costs are lower in the virtual world  than  the  bricks-and-mortar  one, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthus increasingly expect to find the cheapest prices over electronic, and particularly direct electronic, routes. Put simply, when they go to a  hotel  company's  web  site, they  expect  to find the best value there.This study has shown that in many cases this is simply not the case, given that luxury hotels in particular tend to offer  their  highest  rates  over  direct  channels-and  (ironically)  their  cheapest  rates over  the  most  expensive  on-line  intermediaries. Informal follow up to the study revealed that  this  may  be  due  to  the  proactive  approach of the on-line companies in contacting hotel  companies  on  practically  a  daily  basis and encouraging them to reduce their rates in return for better positioning on their search listings. In contrast, the rates on hotel companies' web sites go largely unmanaged, in many cases  being  set  far  in  advance  and  not  adjusted to reflect changing supply and demand.\n\nIrrespective of its root cause, the behavior of  hotel  companies is  driving  Internet  shoppers  into  the  arms  of  the  waiting  on-line intermediaries, where  in  addition  to  consistently low prices, they also find wide product choice. Because  of  this, it's  likely  that  many hotels are losing potential bookings to competitors  as  a  result  of  consumers'  migration\n\ntoward the on-line travel sites that offer relatively  low  rates  from  many  different  hotel chains. Instead of being presented with a list of  a  chain's  properties  on  a  company's  web site, prospective guests see a much wider variety of options from the on-line intermediary and may be tempted to book a competitor's room (especially  if  price  becomes  an  issue). Once consumers conclude that they will usually find better prices on a third-party channel, they will make Expedia or Travelocity, for example, their  first  port  of  call  for  future bookings-threatening brand loyalty, driving up  transaction  fees, increasing  reservation leakage, and strengthening the third parties' power to demand 'special rates' or commission overrides for a company to gain premium positioning (or even inclusion) in their search listings. Hotel companies need to take urgent action if they are not to lose control over the sale  of  their  own  product. At  the  very  least, this means offering consistent prices over all channels, but more probably means providing customers the lowest rate over their own web site. This  would  decrease  guests'  motivation to  book  on  alternative  electronic  channels, would help build web-site traffic, and should help to decrease distribution costs.\n\n",

Firms that embrace CRM strive to provide consistent and personal customer service over time and  across  multiple  touch  points. At  first glance, the  lodging  sector, with  its  emphasis on  customer  service  and  multiplicity  of  customer touch points, seems ideally positioned to take advantage of CRM initiatives. We believe, however, that  the  current  structure  of the lodging industry gives rise to a 'data-ownership dilemma,' which appears to be limiting the  adoption  of  a  comprehensive  CRM  approach. 10 The three parties typically involved in  running  a  hotel-the  owner, the  management company, and the brand ( Brand refers to  the  franchiser  that  flags  a  given  property (e.g., Hilton, Marriott, Six Continents)-have partially misaligned interests and, as a result, often resist sharing customer data, a prerequisite for successful CRM. (The recent slew of lawsuits between  brands  and  ownership groups  that  allege  data  misuse  confirms  the often conflicted relationship between the entities; see Billing, 2002, for example.)\n\nThis paper highlights the data-ownership dilemma and outlines several possible future scenarios  leading  to  its  resolution.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "C ustomer Relationship Management (CRM) is  currently  one  of  the  hottest  topics  in  the fields  of  business  strategy, information  technology, and  marketing  management  (Hall, 2001, 24-27). Put simply, CRM is a management philosophy that calls for the reconfiguration  of  the  firm's  activities  around  the customer. CRM differs from traditional marketing initiatives (see Table 1.8) in that, while the  latter  take  predominately  a  short-term, transaction approach, CRM focuses on maximizing revenue from each customer over the lifetime of the relationship by getting to know each one intimately (Wilson, Daniel, and McDonald, 2002, 193-219). CRM is also, by definition, a crossfunctional philosophy that calls for substantial business integration (Markus, 2000). Thus, to implement CRM successfully, a very different mindset is needed: The firm no longer markets to customers, but it fosters a  relationship  with  them  through  programs that span marketing, operations, information systems, accounting, and other organizational functions.\n\nOne  of  the  questions  most  often  asked about  CRM  is, 'why  bother?' Changing  an organization's philosophy and methods of operation is troublesome; developing and maintaining in-depth customer databases is expensive  and  the  benefits  of  the  approach are not guaranteed. Day, Dean, and Reynolds neatly summarize the benefits of using CRM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 1.8 Traditional Marketing Versus CRM Approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Day, Dean  and  Reynolds, 1998, 828-837) First, by developing a closer relationship with customers, the  firm  may  gain  a  competitive advantage  and, through  increased  switching costs, may be able to defend it. Over time individual  customers  typically  educate  a  company about their individual needs, wants, and preferences-a  costly  process  that  they  are reluctant to repeat with a rival (Peppers and Rodgers, 1994, 6). Thus, getting to know customers intimately creates a barrier to imitation of the leader's strategy.\n\nSecond, effective  CRM  can  lead  to  increased  customer  satisfaction. Properly  implemented, the  customer-company  dialogue facilitates  the  tailoring  of  products  and  services closely to individual needs, and the development  of  new  products  and  services  to meet  changing  needs  or  even  anticipate  future needs (Palmer, 1994).\n\nThird, using CRM techniques contributes to decreasing overall marketing expenditure. Acquiring new customers is estimated to be more  expensive  than  keeping  existing  ones (Blattberg and Deighton, 1996, 136-144). Figures of between five and seven times as much have  been  quoted  (Kotler, 1997). And, last,\n\ndeveloping  a  closer  relationship  with  customers  is  thought  to  increase  customer  loyalty, and loyal customers are thought to stay with  the  firm  longer, buy  more  from  it, and buy more often (Dowling, 2002, 87-104). An oft-quoted statistic is that companies can improve profitability by between 25 and 85 percent  by  reducing  customer  defections  by  5 percent (Reichheld and Sassre, 1990, 301-307). While  the  value  of  loyalty  is  currently  being  debated  (Reinartz  and  Kumar, 2002, 4-12), for some time now lodging firms have been fostering loyalty through frequenttraveler programs and CRM may be seen as the logical next step.\n\nThe  above  arguments  offered  by  CRM proponents suggest that CRM leads to higher profitability due to increased sales, declining customer  acquisition  costs, and  increasing profitability of customers willing to pay a premium for 'better' service. Figure 1.1 presents a  graphical  representation  of  how  CRM  is thought to work. The top row of effects leads to building relationships with customers and thus  establishing  customer  loyalty. The  bottom row lists well-accepted outcomes of datamining  activities. Together  those  two  sets  of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noutcomes  have  stimulated  many  companies to invest in creating a database-driven CRM system (Dowling, 2002).\n\nSome  authors  warn  that  substantial  investments in CRM are not right for everyone (Gronroos, 1990, 3-11). In  a  small  or  niche business, for  example, it  is  relatively  easy  to keep  in  touch  with  customers'  preferences. But because of the significant increase in the amount of information that must be managed as the firm's scale and scope increase, successful  CRM  requires  significant  investments  in technology, process redesign, and people. An airline  or  a  major  international  hotel  chain must manage substantially larger amounts of data than does a small inn to achieve a similar relationship with its customers. However, information  technology  (IT)-used  appropriately-can help mitigate the problem. Between 1990 and today, the world has seen enormous  transformations  in  the  extent  to\n\nwhich  organizations  can  deploy  computer power. IT  allows  customer  data  to  be  collected, consolidated, manipulated, and  analyzed on an unprecedented scale, and IT has been identified by many authors as one of the key success factors for CRM implementation (Hall, 2001). IT  allows  increased  reach  into new markets without high incremental entry costs, and facilitates specifically tailored customer  marketing  and  increased  responsiveness (Gamble, Stone, and Woodcock, 1999).\n\nThe role of IT in CRM efforts is so important that some writers (such as Copulshy and Wolf, 1990, 16-20), and many practicing managers  and  vendors, associate  CRM  with the technology that is used to support the approach. Many use the term in the highly specific  sense  of  database  marketing, where  a range of demographic, lifestyle, and purchasing  activities  are  recorded  and  tracked, and subsequently  used  as  the  basis  of  targeting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndifferentiated  products  to  selected  customer groups. In  turn, their  response  to  each  marketing contact is tracked and used to further refine  the  approach. However, CRM  is  a broader concept than just technology. For example, CRM has been defined as 'an enterprise-wide commitment  to  identify  your named, individual customers and create a relationship  between your company and these customers so long as that relationship is mutually  beneficial' (Gamble et  al., 1999). This definition  highlights  several  key  CRM  concepts-that  the  company  will  actively  seek out the right customers (and, by implication, will not target those that will not do business with  them), will  develop  a  long-term, mutually beneficial  relationship  with  each  customer by starting and maintaining a two-way dialogue, will strive  to  satisfy  customers' needs and solve customer problems, and will support customers throughout the life cycle of their  interactions  with  the  firm  (Piccoli, Spalding, and Ives, 2001, 38-45).\n\nThis  approach  to  CRM  demands  more than computer systems and information technology. The customer must become the focal point of the organization. All members of the organization  must  understand  and  support the shared values required for CRM, its philosophy  must  encompass  not  just  marketing but  the  entire  organization, and  it  must  be used to manage all aspects of the customer relationship in a coordinated way.\n\nAlthough limited  research  about  the  effectiveness  of  CRM  has  been  published  to date, most  observers  agree  that  successful CRM  is  predicated  on  the  ability  to  effectively capture exhaustive data about existing and  potential  customers, profile  them  accurately, identify  their  individual  needs  and idiosyncratic  expectations, and  generate  actionable customer knowledge that can be dis-\n\ntributed for ad-hoc use at each point of contact (Newell, 2000). The  objective  is to achieve a comprehensive view of customers, and be able to consistently anticipate and react to their needs with targeted and effective activities at every customer touch point. CRM requires the firm to keep track of the information produced through each interaction so that it can 'learn' on a continuous basis, get to know each guest better, and enrich its database of individual customer knowledge (Marsan, 2000, 91-94). Godin  has  likened CRM to 'dating  a  customer,' in  that  it  is  a long-term process that requires an investment of  time, information, and  resources  by  both parties (Godin, 1999). The result is an active, participatory, and interactive relationship between customer and supplier. Lastly, CRM is about customization, or the ability to consistently  treat  different  customers  differently (Newell, 2000). Relationships  differ  as  they develop. We  do  not  treat  old  friends  in  the same way as new friends or good friends in the same way as casual acquaintances (Gamble et al., 1999). Such consistent personalized interaction requires integration and synchronization  of  many  organizational  functions, from  marketing  to  accounting  to  operations and  information  systems. Failure  to  understand  the  scope, essence, and  magnitude  of CRM is  likely  to  result  in  problems, rather than its promised benefits.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "L odging-industry participants face an increasingly competitive market (Vialle, 1995). In addition, the  basis  of  competition  is  changing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLocation, a key driver of business, is fixed in the  short  and  medium  term, and  attracting and  retaining  customers  based  on  facilities and amenities is becoming increasingly difficult  as  they  have  become  increasingly  standardized  across  competing  brands. Price competition is unattractive, even more so as consumers  are  able  to  easily  find  and  compare  prices  over  the  Internet  (O'Connor, 2002, 285-293). As a consequence consumers are increasingly displaying less brand loyalty (Gamble et al., 1999), and CRM is becoming increasingly attractive as a way for hotel companies to differentiate themselves from their competitors  (Francese  and  Renaghan, 1990, 60-63).\n\nThe lodging sector is ideally suited to applying the principles of CRM. In few other industries is there such potential to build up a comprehensive  and  accurate  picture  of  the client. In  few  other  industries  do  customers provide the significant amount of information hotel guests divulge when making a reservation and during their hotel stay. Every interaction between the guest and the customer is an opportunity to refine knowledge about her or him and to further build a relationship. By methodically  collecting, consolidating, and analyzing both guest preferences and transactional data, hotel chains have the potential to develop  a  deep  understanding  of  each  customer's needs and preferences, provide substantially improved service levels, individually tailor the customer experience, and generally offer more personalized service. Providing outstanding personal service is certainly not a new concept in the hotel sector. Companies  such  as  Ritz-Carlton  and  the Savoy  group  historically  maintained  extensive  manual  guest-history  systems  recording guest preferences in an effort to better serve their  best  customers. However, when  oper-\n\nated manually, such systems are expensive to maintain, are  frequently  inaccurate, and  can only  be  used  to  track  a  limited  number  of clients  at  individual  properties  (Main  and O'Connor, 1998, 7-15). Developments in information  and  communications  technologies have enabled automation and efficiencies in these processes, reducing costs, increasing accuracy, and  allowing  comprehensive  knowledge about each customer to be shared on a global basis. As a result, many companies are turning  to  technology  to  improve  customer service  by  implementing  large-scale  CRM programs.\n\nAnalysis of the lodging sector shows that, driven in most cases by pressure from the marketing function, many of the dominant hotel chains are in the process of deploying (or have already  deployed)  the  technological  infrastructure to support CRM. A recent study by Arthur Andersen  and  New York  University found that over one-third of U.S. hotel chains had a data warehouse in 2000, with another 50 percent planning to install one in the near future  ( Hospitality  2000, 8). Many chains have introduced  information  systems  to  improve the  targeting  of  marketing  and  sales  efforts. Such systems can help the firm to assess the value  of  each  customer  as  well  as  their propensity to respond to various offers, and to market to them individually.\n\nAs  discussed  earlier, while  important, such initiatives do not imply that the company has adopted CRM. In most cases, such developments focus solely on marketing objectives and lack the integration among functional areas that characterizes a CRM initiative. Only where  the  company  reconfigures  its  operations to deliver a comprehensive view of the customer  and  to  support  consistent, highly personalized service at every customer touch point could it truly be regarded as CRM. Few\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompanies  in  the  lodging  sector  appear  to have progressed to such an advanced stage.\n\nGiven the geographic dispersion of hotel properties and the role of brands in marketing  and  distribution, large-scale  CRM initiatives seem most justifiable at the brand level. Implementing CRM at this level would help to  increase  consistency  and  personal  service throughout  the  chain  and  at  each  customer touch point. However, to achieve this, consistent and comprehensive information must be captured from all properties within the brand and then consolidated, analyzed, interpreted, and subsequently disseminated to each property  in  time  to  influence  the  next  customer interaction.\n\nTwo barriers currently prevent that from happening-a lack of standardization and ITsystem integration within each franchise, and the fact that at any one time there may be up to three parties holding a stake in the operations of a particular property (owner, management company, and brand).The two issues are largely interconnected as the industry's generally reactive attitude toward IT has been exacerbated  by  its  structural  characteristics. The technical challenge is subsiding due to recent developments  in  technology, including  the emergence of the application service provider (ASP) model. ( Note: When software applications are delivered using an ASP model, they are not installed on the computers at the property. Rather, they are accessed by remote users via the Web.Thus, IT resources under the ASP model are not bought but acquired as a service.) A discussion of these technologies is beyond the scope of this article. Note, however, that, even assuming away technological challenges, we  believe  that  the  structure  of  the lodging  industry  creates  severe  obstacles  to successful CRM. The remainder of the paper focuses on these challenges.\n\n",

      "content": "L odging  is  an  important  component  of  the tourism  industry, providing  accommodation (and associated ancillary services) to travelers while  away  from  home. Lodging  operations are  diverse, ranging  from  small  bed-andbreakfast properties in rural locations to large hotels with several thousand rooms in major cities. Table 1.9 provides an overview of geographical dispersion, showing that the majority of the world's hotel properties are concentrated  in  Europe  (55  percent)  and North America (22 percent). The exhibit also demonstrates that the average property size in  North America  is  larger  than  that  in  Europe  (56  versus  28  rooms), with  chain-affiliated properties being more common in North America. Despite controlling only a minority of  room  stock  (approximately  30  percent  of total room supply) hotel chains dominate the lodging  sector  (Corporate  300, 1998, 51-77) and  tend  to  exert  a  disproportionate  influence on industry operations and performance (Cline and Rach, 1997, 35).\n\nIn addition to generally having higher occupancy  and  average  daily  rate  (Worldwide Hotel Industry Study, 1998), chain properties tend to be more profitable, delivering trading profit per room seven times more than their independent  counterparts  (Slattery, 1992, 90-102). As a result, the industry is expected to continue to consolidate, with an increasing number of mergers and acquisitions resulting in a small number of large companies dominating the marketplace  (Corporate  300, 1998).\n\nA differentiation must be made between hotel  ownership, hotel  branding, and  hotel operations. Historical  developments  with\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 1.9 The International Hotel Industry\n\nSource: World Travel and Tourism Council 1995\n\n*Total does not add up to 100 due to rounding.\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the United States gave rise to a situation where many owners could not operate their own hotels. Instead  they  must  use  a  separate  management  company  to  oversee  day-to-day operations ( The International Hotel Industry, 2001, 85), resulting  in  a  split  between  hotel ownership and hotel operations.The situation is further complicated by the widespread use of both franchises and marketing agreements that  provide  a  consumer  brand  and  require compliance  with  brand  standards  (Singh, 1997, 89-107).\n\nAt any one time there may be up to three parties holding a stake in the operations of a particular property: (1) the owner, who holds title to the assets, is responsible for mortgage payments  and  provides  the  capital  for  the operation; (2)  the  brand, which  brands  the\n\nproperty and provides standards, distribution services, marketing, technology, and  other services; and  (3)  the  management  company, which provides management talent and operates the property on a day-to-day basis. Table 1.10 demonstrates how, with the exception of Wyndham  International, the  major  brand companies  own  less  than  one-third  of  their branded properties, with various management companies operating the remainder on behalf of  their  owners. Furthermore, as  Table  1.11 shows, within each management company the brand portfolio is quite mixed, with each company operating under a variety of competing flags  in  different  geographical  markets. The data lend support to our claim that in the U.S. lodging industry there are multiple stakeholders with, at times competing, interest in the operations of the property.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A s  was  discussed  earlier, CRM's  success  is predicated  on  the  ability  to  collect, analyze, and disseminate large amounts of timely and relevant information for customer-service operatives to act on to improve the experience at  each  point  of  customer  contact. Thus, a CRM initiative cannot be successful without commitment among a critical mass of properties. Hotel  chains  cannot  provide  a  consistently  high  level  of  personal  service  unless customer data can be garnered from most, if not all, of the affiliated properties, organized and synthesized in one central location, and subsequently  redistributed  to  each  property on an as-needed basis. However, we propose that (technological constraints aside) this apparently simple theoretical proposition is difficult to realize in the lodging industry due to an inherent data-ownership conflict between the  major  industry  stakeholders. In  the  following  sections  we  present  the  main  issues facing the brand, the management company, and the owner.\n\nThe Brand. For brands, the development of an effective CRM initiative is deemed an important competitive move as it would facilitate the development of a deep understanding of customer  needs  and  preferences, potentially resulting in a high level of personalization, thus helping to improve service levels  across  the  brand  as  a  whole. As  a  result guests  would  have  a  strong  incentive  to  remain loyal to the brand and patronize affili-\n\nated  properties, thus  increasing  the  value proposition for owners and operators through improvements in financial performance.\n\nFor the promised benefits of CRM to materialize, standardized  information  systems must  be  implemented  throughout  the  franchise  network  to  allow  data  to  be  obtained from  all  branded  properties-a  problem  in the past, becoming less important as a result of recent technology improvements. Furthermore, the brand must be willing to share the customer knowledge generated by the consolidation of customer data chain-wide with the individuals that can take action based on it at each  point  of  customer  contact. Such  data sharing  presents  the  first  dilemma. In  some cases, the  brand  may  be  reticent  to  disseminate  customer  knowledge back to the property for fear that owners or operators might use it to poach high-value customers and divert  them  to  competing  brands  within  their own portfolios. For example, imagine a management company that operates a hotel flying one flag (Brand A) in a particular market, and a  competing  flag  (Brand  B)  in  others. This company  might  be  tempted  to  steer  highvalue customers toward its Brand B hotels in markets where it does not operate Brand A hotels. Thus, Brand  A  is  faced  with  a  decision-either share the data it collects companywide  to  reap  the  benefits  of  large-scale CRM and risk the poaching of high-value customers  by  some  of  its  partner  management companies operating individual properties; or protect its customer knowledge from the interests  of  multi-flag  owners  and  operators, thus forgoing the full benefits of CRM.\n\nThe  Management  Company. Management  companies  do  not  appear  to  have strong incentives to develop a CRM initiative for themselves. As was shown in Table 1.11, such  companies  tend  to  operate  a  varied\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nportfolio  of  properties, each  flying  different flags, on behalf of different owners. By definition  a  CRM  initiative  developed  across flags is unlikely to generate brand loyalty and thus  is  of  limited  interest  to  most  management companies.\n\nThe question arises, however, as to whether  management  companies  should  actively cooperate with the collection of operational guest data by brand-level CRM initiatives. As most companies operate a varied portfolio of flags, if the management company  participates  in  a  brand-based  CRM initiative, it  will  stand  to  gain  only  in  those properties  that  carry  that  particular  brand. Conversely, participation will result in a competitive  disadvantage  in  markets  where  it competes against the brand. As a result, management  companies  have  little  incentive  to support brand-level CRM initiatives by contributing data about customers that stay at its properties. In fact, by doing so, they would in effect be undermining their own operations in markets where the brand operating the CRM initiative is a competitor rather than an ally. Moreover, while  the  management  company may  not  be  interested  in  detailed  customer data for branding purposes, it certainly finds value in customer data that allows it to create customer-value  models  and  better  target high-value prospects, particularly with respect to  group  business. Consequently, management companies have in effect an incentive to limit data disclosure and not cooperate with brand-level CRM initiatives.\n\nThe Owner. While owners, like operators, typically have many flags in their portfolio of properties, they  have  a  different  focus  in terms  of  profitability. Many  primarily  view hotel  ownership  as  a  real-estate  investment, and have a marginal interest in the question, 'Who owns the data?'Where their properties\n\nfly  the  flag  of  a  successful  CRM  initiative, they may have an advantage over other competing  properties; where  their  properties  fly competing flags, they may be at a disadvantage. Thus, the same dilemma facing the management company seems to affect the owners-whether  to  participate  in  brandlevel CRM initiatives, or to refuse to cooperate  with  the  collection  and  consolidation  of customer data. The owners may also have interests  that  go  beyond  the  use  of  the  data strictly  for  operational  purposes. Customer data  may  be  used  by  the  other  entities  (the brand  and  the  management  company)  for marketing  purposes  and  analyses  that  run counter  to  the  owner's  own  interests  (e.g., studying the feasibility of building new properties in the same geographical area).\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I n this paper we have drawn attention to what we term the 'data-ownership dilemma'-the inherent  conflict  that  various  entities  in  the lodging industry face as they embrace CRM. We propose that the data-ownership dilemma represents  a  significant, yet  often  unrecognized, challenge to the success of CRM initiatives. As  was  discussed, CRM  strategies appear most applicable at the brand level, but their success is dependent on the active cooperation of both the operator and the owner of each  property. For  CRM  to  succeed  at  the brand level, operators must supply the brand with in-depth customer data-a requirement with which operators in particular, and owners to a lesser extent, have little incentive to comply. Brands also face challenges in terms of  maintaining  control  over  the  resulting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncustomer knowledge and preventing its spread outside the brand network.\n\nBecause  of  this  conflict, we  believe  that CRM  in  the  lodging  industry  may  never progress beyond its current, relatively limited, level  of  sophistication. While  database-marketing techniques will continue to be used, we propose  that  few  hotel  companies  will  successfully  implement  large-scale, chain-wide, CRM  initiatives. Only  if  significant  change occurs in the structure or methods of operation  of  the  sector  are  the  full  benefits  of  a CRM approach likely to be realized.\n\nIn closing, we  speculate  as  to what changes will have to occur for successful implementation  of  CRM  initiatives. We  see three possible scenarios: there will be a fundamental  change  in  the  way  in  which  hotel brands are organized; a change in the nature of  franchise  agreements  and  management contracts; or there will be more cooperation among  brands  to  take  advantage  of  CRM's promised benefits. These three scenarios are further  developed  in  the  remainder  of  this article.\n\nThe  first  scenario  is  that  the  need  for adoption  of  a  CRM  approach  will  induce changes  in  the  ownership  and  management structure of the lodging sector. If CRM truly provides compelling benefits, the large brands should  begin  to  pressure  the  management companies  and  franchisees  within  their  network to provide the data needed for successful CRM  operations. Those  brands  that manage  a  relatively  large  number  of  their own hotels will be in a good position to take advantage of these initiatives quickly, should face  little  resistance  as  a  result  of  the  dataownership  dilemma, and  should  be  able  to easily  reap  the  benefits  of  CRM. Wyndham International's  ByRequest  initiative  demonstrates that highly integrated lodging brands\n\nare  moving  quickly  to  embrace  CRM  (see sidebar). If  these  pioneers  are  successful  in their effort and are able to attract and retain high-value customers, competing brands will have to follow suit and develop similar CRM capabilities. Such  companies  would  have  to resolve the data-ownership dilemma either by 'integrating down' or by restricting the number  of  flags  that  the  companies  operating their hotels can fly. Integrating down implies that brands would move aggressively to take over  the  operational  management  of  their branded  properties. Such  integrated  companies should be able to standardize the IT infrastructure needed to support CRM, mandate the collection and consolidation of customer  data, and  provide  each  property with dynamic access to the central knowledge repository. Since  all  operations  would  effectively be managed by the brand, there would be  no  conflicts  of  interest  and  no  danger  of high-value customers being poached, freeing the brand to take full advantage of the CRM initiative.\n\nObviously, taking  over  operational  control  of  their  unit  properties  would  be  a  dramatic  and  high-risk  strategy. Thus, brands, particularly  in  the  short  term, may  instead concentrate  on  restructuring  their  management and franchise  agreements  to  minimize the barriers to success discussed earlier. Redevelopment  should  focus  on  two  main  areas-data  collection  and  data  use. While many  franchise  agreements  require  properties to feed its customer-folio data back to the central  level, few  specifically  mention  any other data collected about the guest.As CRM is dependent on building up a holistic picture of the guest's needs and behavior, this oversight  may  force  brands  to  restructure  contracts  to  force  greater  compliance  with  data needs. Such restructured contracts could spec-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A s  part  of  our  research, we investigated the CRM initiatives of large hotel chains. One such  chain, Wyndham  International, has made CRM a cornerstone of its brand strategy. We briefly describe the key characteristics of Wyndham's CRM approach to aid the reader in understanding the principal characteristics of large-scale CRM initiatives.\n\nWyndham  International  is  one  of  the five  largest  U.S.-based  hotel  chains, with  a portfolio of over 160 branded properties.After converting from paired-share REIT status  to  a  C  corporation  in  1999, Wyndham revised its corporate strategy in an effort to become a 'world-class branded hotel operating company.' 1 Wyndham's differentiation strategy  is  nicely  captured  in  the  words  of Andrew  Jordan, Wyndham's  senior  vice president of marketing: 'We said, okay, we are going to reinvent the Wyndham brand. We are going to say: We are all about personalized  service. We  are  going  to  say: We are  the  brand  who  really  recognizes  that guests  are  individuals, we  know  you  have specific  needs, quirks-you  tell  us  about them one time and we are going to remember them.' 2\n\nThe cornerstone of Wyndham's strategy is its membership-based  CRM  initiative: Wyndham  ByRequest. When  a  guest  joins ByRequest, he or she completes a comprehensive profile including general and contact information, room preferences (e.g., room location, needed  extra  items, newspaper), credit  card  and  express  check-in/check-out preferences, airline  frequent-flyer  prefer-\n\nences, personal interests (e.g., activities, music, readings, spectator  sports), and  complimentary beverages and snacks (e.g., preferred wine, soft drinks, juice, snacks).\n\nThe  above  information  is  compiled  at Wyndham's  headquarters  and  a  pledge  is made to the guest that, irrespective of which property  in  the  Wyndham  chain  the  guest travels to in the future, he or she can expect a  consistent  level  of  personalized  service. This includes a room that is located where desired and fitted with the required amenities, a welcome snack and drink that's of the guest's liking, and information that suits the traveler's interests (e.g., reading material, information about shows or sporting events).\n\nKey to the initiative's success is the realization that, while important, the technology underlying Wyndham ByRequest-including the  website, the  preferences  databases, and integrated operational systems (e.g., PMS)does not in and of itself deliver the ByRequest promise.As a result,Wyndham has designated staff members to support ByRequest and created a property-level position-the Wyndham ByRequest manager-who has responsibility over property-level execution, and Wyndham has developed integrated processes for delivering the ByRequest promise.\n\n1 'Letter to Shareholders,' Wyndham International 2000 Annual Report, 2001.\n\n2 For complete information about Wyndham ByRequest, see G. Piccoli and L. Applegate, 'Wyndham International: Fostering HighTouch with High-Tech,' Harvard Business School Case Study, 2003; # 9-803-092.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nify  that  all  customer  data  generated  at  the property level be extracted and loaded to the brand's central data repository. Management contracts  also  need  to  be  rewritten  to  offer protection to the brand as it disseminates customer knowledge back to the property level. Both  of  these  measures  mean  that  ties  between brands and operators would be strengthened, which may ultimately result in further industry consolidation as owners and operators feel pressure to fly a limited number of flags. In an extreme scenario, each operator would effectively become aligned with one brand and fly only one flag.\n\nThe final potential scenario we envision is the emergence of an industry consortium that both develops and maintains the CRM infrastructure and standardizes customer-data collection  and  distribution. As  it  has  happened historically  with  hotel  e-commerce  systems such as THISCo (The Hotel Industry Switching Company), HDS (Hotel Distribution Systems) and Avendra (an e-procurement marketplace), competing brands could cooperate to develop the standards and the infrastructure necessary to capture, store, organize, and  distribute  customer  information. Such  a scenario  is  attractive  as  joint  development\n\nwould mean that the infrastructure could be delivered  and  operated  at  a  fraction  of  the cost  of  proprietary  initiatives. Thereafter, rather than being used as a basis of competition, customer data would be shared and companies would compete on the analysis, interpretation, and  use  of  such  data. For  example, competing brands could use the same data to market to their chosen customer bases. Competitive advantage would come from how well they could use the data to identify, target, and build a relationship with each individual.\n\nWe believe the latter  scenario  to  be  the least  likely, even  though  it  may  optimize industry-wide performance. The likelihood of an industry consortium developing and managing customer information for the benefit of the industry as a whole is small, as the industry's  belief  in  the  proprietary  value  of  customer  data, the  industry's  structure, privacy issues, as well as a culture that precludes trust in this domain makes the cooperation necessary unlikely. We see a change in contractual agreements  and  in  industry  structure  as  far more probable. In any case, given the potential proposed for lodging-industry companies, careful  consideration  must  be  given  to  the data-ownership dilemma to avoid failure.\n\n",

      "content": "A ccording to the International SPA Association research, between 2002 and 2003, 11 percent of the national population over the age of 16 made one or more spa visits. This statistic shows that one in ten Americans visited a spa during that period. Additionally, of these, 41 percent were visiting spas for the first time, indicating a larger population embracing spa usage. Age  demographics  show  that  14  percent of clients are between the ages of 16 and 24, and over 50 percent are in the 25 to 44 age bracket.\n\nAn emerging national statistic is the number  of  male  visits  to  spas. Twenty-three  percent of spa visits and 29 percent of spa goers were  men  in  2003, trending  toward  special gender-oriented  treatments  and  male-only spas being opened worldwide.\n\nSpa selection criteria are determined by a number of factors. An established and known environment-for  instance, as  a  part  of  an established resort, club, or destination spaoften  influences  the  decision, as  does  atmosphere, quality of treatment, and friendliness of  staff. Additionally, among  spa  goers, nine\n\nout of ten respondents report they would return for a similar experience.\n\nMost spa customers believe they received good value for their spa dollar. On a 10-point scale, services were given an average of 8 for value, with  massage  generating  8.8  on  the value-for-service scale.\n\nSpa  services  demonstrated  the  highest and heaviest demand on weekends, followed by  appointments  after  work  on  weekdays. Gender demographics also play a role in spa demand, as men are more likely to go for regular  weekly  visits  after  business  hours  or while traveling on business.Women, however, often visit spas during regular business hours (Thacker, 2004; Audi and Wright, 2004).\n\nThe International Hotel Resort Spa Association (IHRSA) reports that branded resort spas such as Canyon Ranch are opening in the day spa market, adding new competitive pressure  on  the  independents. Nontraditional players  are  also  adding  product  supply. For example, corporations  are  creating  in-house spa environments, hospitals are adding wellness as part of their repertoire, and medi-spas, with a primary focus on cosmetic surgery, are adding  spa  business  as  an  additional  profit center. Health clubs are also trying to capture a piece of the pie by adding spa practices. The rationale in this market is that time-crunched patrons can benefit from the one-stop-shopping approach to fitness and wellness, but the health club operator also uses the spa as an enticement to join the fitness center.\n\nAs the  day  and  destination  spa  markets become saturated, it will become imperative for  survival  that  each  operator  differentiate from the competition. The necessity for market segmentation to ensure clear communication with consumers will be a key to success in the maturing spa market.Another component of success will be a branding strategy that the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsumer  can  immediately  identify  with  respect to spa performance and the consumer's personal comfort level.\n\n",

This  indicated  to  the  medical community that the significant out-of-pocket expenses implied not only lost revenues to traditional (allopathic) doctors but also a broad dissatisfaction  with  mainstream  medicine. A great number of people were taking the issues of  health  and  well-being  into  their  own  control, thus setting the stage for the popularity of proactive wellness programs.\n\nIn 1997, Eisenberg updated his study. He estimated the total number of visits to alternative medical providers at 600 million, representing an expenditure of over $27.1 billion. The number of visits to alternative care physicians in 1997 was greater than the total number  of  visits  to  traditional  primary  care physicians  in  the  same  year. The  increasing popularity of alternative wellness modalities, the aging of the population, and the strength of  the  economy  are  all  factors  that  support the growth of this trend. As of this writing, it appears to continue to grow.\n\nThe  use  of  at  least  1  of  16  (alternative) therapies during the previous year increased from 33.8 percent in 1990 to 42.1 percent in 1997.

In both  1990  and  1997, alternative  therapies were used most frequently for chronic conditions, especially  back  problems, anxiety, depression, and headaches.

      "content": "S pa development and its attendant popularity have deep historical roots and vast potential for the hospitality industry. The term spa was once reserved for European destination resorts  where  guests  went  to  'take  the  waters' and restore a healthy and balanced life. However, the  term  now  is  used  to  describe many types of facilities and amenities in the U.S. lodging industry. At one end of the spa\n\nspectrum  are  dedicated  destination  resort spas aimed primarily at those seeking a specialized combination regime of health, fitness, and pampering. Modalities and treatments include massages, unique treatments, custom dietary plans, lectures, and adventures that can include, but are not limited to, an array of activities  ranging  from  nonsurgical  facelifts  to helicopter skiing.\n\nDestination  resorts, such  as  Miraval's Life-in-Balance and Canyon Ranch, with locations  in  the  Berkshires  in  Massachusetts and  the  Arizona  desert, draw  demand  because  of  their  facilities  and  reputation. The primary reason for going to a destination resort  spa  is  to  enjoy  the  spa  itself  and  its  related  activities. The  destination  itself  is  a demand generator.\n\nClosely related to a destination resort spa is the  amenity  spa. Amenity  spas  provide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nservices to resorts and full-service hotels. The primary  difference  between  an  amenity  spa and a destination spa is the scope and depth of spa  services. Amenity  spas, while  sometimes quite  extensive, support the  resort  environment, whereas destination spas are the focus of the resort environment. In situations where a  full-service, high-end  hotel  is  located  in  an urban  environment  and  has  a  significantly large spa component, the spa can operate as both an amenity spa (to the hotel) and a day spa  (to  the  local  community). Later  in  this chapter, we study the case of the Westin Los Angeles  Century  City's  35,000-square-foot Spa Mystique. This spa supports the needs of the hotel's convention and individual travelers while experiencing heavy local day spa use.\n\nMiddle-market hotel properties now feel obliged to add a spa as an amenity; however, due to capital and real estate restraints, often they cannot provide a full-service location.As a result, this sector has seen an explosion in poorly conceived and executed spa additions that provide the owner the opportunity to add '. . . and spa' at the end of the business name. These  are  often  no  more  than  the  result  of subcontracting a massage therapist and converting  the  guest  room  closest  to  the  swimming pool into an exercise room. These spas seldom surprise and delight their guests and often reflect poorly on the spa industry overall. Fortunately, the  sophistication  of  the  industry is making it harder and harder for the '. . . and spas' to succeed.\n\nAs the spa industry matures, certain development trends are emerging. In 2005, the spa industry was considered the fastest-growing  segment  of  the  travel, hospitality, and leisure  market, showing  26  percent  growth from 2002 to 2004. Spas are no longer considered a niche industry but rather an entity unto themselves.\n\nThe  spa  industry  is  made  up  of  the  following segments, each with its own characteristics and operational opportunities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Historically, spa  operations  were  treated  by management  similarly  to  other  revenue  departments, like catering  and  restaurants. These departments were simply perceived as an amenity needed to attract guests to the hotel. As long as the department broke even, or didn't lose too much money, their ability to increase occupancy was deemed sufficient justification  for  their  existence. However, in  the late  1990s, hotel  spas  followed  the  path  of other operating departments and transformed from support facilities to profit centers. This trend is strong and continues today.\n\nIn  1999, PKF  Consulting  identified  only 30 hotels in the United States, thousands that report data to the PKF, extensive spa facilities and  analyzed  the  financial  performance  of those  properties  and  their  spa  departments. Dedicated  destination  spa  resorts  were  not included in the analysis due to an insufficient sample.\n\nWhile spas were a relatively small source of  revenues  for  the  sample  properties, spa revenues grew at a relatively strong pace. In 1999, spa revenues for the subject sample represented just 3.3 percent of total sales. However, from  1998  to  1999, spa  revenues  grew\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n16.6 percent. This compares  to  revenue growth  rates  of  5.2  percent  for  rooms, 12.2 percent for food, and 3.2 percent for telecommunications, and a 0.3 percent decline in revenues for the beverage department.\n\nDuring 1999, the spa departments in the sample  of  hotels  averaged  a  departmental profit  margin  of  30.7  percent. However, spa department  profits  did  grow  a  strong  51.3 percent from 1998 to 1999.\n\nSpas  mirror  and  enhance  trends  in  the lodging industry. Drawing heavily from residential design and the use of technology, hotel designers  and  operators  create  a  spa experience that:\n\nNorth American spas are rapidly becoming more segmented, pursuing market niches well outside the traditional ladies-who-lunch demographic. Adventure  spas, fitness  spas, children spas, family spas, and even pet spas are part of a new generation of spa facilities, spa programs-and, most importantly, spa aficionados. Spas now attract a much wider demographic that includes men, women, couples, children, teenagers, and families.\n\nSince  the  early  part  of  the  twenty-first century, spas  have  been  redirecting  their menus  to  include  stress  relief  and  resultsoriented therapies. By focusing on the social benefits  of  hanging  out  in  a  safe, relaxing place, they  not  only  address  current  market needs  but  also  support  the  development  of spa  programs  that  can  be  incorporated  into virtually any leisure-oriented environment or level of lodging. In particular, destination spas\n\nand full-service resorts provide platforms that have both the infrastructure and the economies  of  scale  to  support  cutting-edge spa treatments, sometimes also referred to as spa modalities.\n\nSpas are no longer solely about frivolous self-indulgence  and  luxurious  pampering. They are  being  reevaluated  and  repackaged with  a  broader  emphasis  on  self-care, stress relief, emotional balancing, and preventative (as opposed to reactive) wellness modalities. This trend is being embraced by aging baby boomers  as  an  adjunct  to  traditional  health care. Because of this trend in health care, hotels and resorts have acknowledged and embraced the need for full-service spas as part of their amenities and facilities. The inclusion of a  well-integrated  spa  can  provide  additional (and lucrative) sales and marketing opportunities. Conversely, the  exclusion  of  a  spa facility  may  disqualify  a  property  from  consideration. Ironically, many hotel guests may dismiss a property out of hand for lacking a spa not because they require the services of a spa but rather because its absence may imply other areas of the hotel are also deficient in meeting current market expectations.\n\nIs it logical, then, that all full-service hotels and resorts without a spa should, without hesitation, incorporate  one  into  their  property? Clearly not. Numerous factors must be considered  in  developing  or  repositioning  a spa, especially  in  chain  environments  where the lodging brand is already established. Because  spas  are  capital-  and  labor-intensive, they must materially enhance the property's revenue stream to be considered viable. In addition  to  creating  spa  revenue, a  spa  facility also  must  extend  length  of  stay, drive  room rates, enhance  shoulder  and  low-season  demand, augment food and beverage revenues, and capture new market segments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuccessful  spa  operations  start  with  a standardized level of procedures and a prioritized sensitivity to guest needs. As it is for all departments  in  a  lodging  environment  (or business models in the freestanding day and medical spa world), profitability  is  essential. Especially  in  a  spa  environment, a  dynamic balance is essential to meet the fiscal requirements of the owners and the physical needs of the guest.\n\nA  savvy  spa  manager  continually  monitors  the  spa  and  hotel  operations  to  ensure that everything possible is being done to enhance  the  synergy  of  the  two  entities. Constant monitoring  also  provides  an  early warning  system  to  the  spa  operator  if  revenues are falling or if expenses are not in line with anticipated revenues or budgeted amounts. Spotting these trends early enables the manager to take efficient, proactive steps to  ensure  that  positive  trends  are  enhanced and negative ones controlled. Constant monitoring sets a standard of operations, which is an  excellent  way  to  train  and  motivate  employees. It also puts employees on notice that the spa is a well-run business with extensive attention  to  detail, which  should  discourage any actions that might not be in the best interest of the spa's reputation and profitability.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A spa's reputation is easily made or destroyed by  its  level  of  customer  service. Guests  can forgive an occasional shortcoming if the level of service is exceptional. For this reason, it is essential that all spas have an integrated quality management program that provides ongoing training to assist its employees in addressing customers'  expectations. Customer  service  training  (CST)  helps  ensure\n\nthat  guests'  expectations  are  exceeded. In  a spa  environment, expectations  are  usually very high, and a trusting bond can be quickly established if the spa employees are sensitive to guest needs.\n\nThe  guest's  arrival  sequence, starting  at the  front  desk, initiates  the  spa  ritual  that brings the spa guest to a place of trust, relaxation, and rejuvenation. CST is proactive and provides employees with the tools they need to meet or exceed guest expectations. Guest CST  is  a  never-ending, all-inclusive  process that bridges textbook training scenarios with operational  realities. The  traditionally  high turnover of spa employees in the hospitality industry requires that CST be introduced as a part of the orientation process and reinforced regularly.\n\nNonproductive  training  time  (time  that does  not  directly  produce  revenue  for  the spa)  is  actually  a  minor  expense  when  compared  to  the  expenses  related  to  employee turnover, poor service, dissatisfied customers, and, ultimately, loss  of  business  and  reputation. Budgets  must  include  CST  as  a  nonoptional  employee  expense. For  long-term success, CST is vital when margins are tight, business is slow, and turnover is high. There is a  strong  correlation  between  high  employee turnover  and  low  CST. Employees  should know that the training program is an investment in them.\n\nCST gives the employee the means to understand what is expected of them as a representative  of  the  establishment  and  identifies what guests expect from their visit. Seeing the process from the guest's point of view helps employees meet or exceed expectations. This minimizes  the  need  to  provide  discounts  or compensation  in  cases  of  service  delivery problems. Discounting  or  'comping' goods and services is a knee-jerk response to poor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nservice and should be reserved for the last effort  in  service  recovery; CST  should  stress this.\n\nAn inclusive training program is the engine behind stellar customer service and guest loyalty. CST should be seamless; while it predominately addresses the needs of the guest, the program also includes instruction on profitability and yield management, thus addressing the needs of the owner as well. In order to meet  or  exceed  profitability  goals, customer service must be delivered in a fiscally responsible  manner. Employees  must  understand customer service in the operational context of the property in which they are employed.\n\nMinimizing  the  expense  of  a  CST  program starts with the proper selection of employees. While there is no steadfast guarantee that a potential employee will work out over the long haul, first impressions, prior work experience, references, and, above  all, attitude and enthusiasm are indications of whether or not  it  is  appropriate  to  hire  and  invest  the time and money in an applicant.\n\nManagement's expectations of guest service delivery should be clearly articulated and integrated into the corporate culture and reinforced daily at all levels and in all departments. Employees, no  matter  what  their responsibility, position, or  tenure, must  be treated with the same level of respect and dignity  that  management  requires  for  their guests. Reinforcing  the  tenets  of  customer service within the corporate culture provides the  employee  with  the  tools  to  do  the  right thing-that is, to ask, 'What do I need to do to make a spa guest happy? How do I exceed their expectations?' Sometimes the little details reap the greatest rewards.\n\nEmployee empowerment is a key component  in  CST. As  an  employee's  experience and skill base develops (and as management\n\nbecomes comfortable with an employee's performance), levels of empowerment should be increased proportionately. Empowerment is a vote of confidence in an employee and a way to quickly resolve problems as they arise.This situation is said by spa managers to increase job  satisfaction, and  the  employee's  ownership of his or her position.\n\nCST also requires a strong foundation in the technical skills of how a department runs. Routine procedures, appropriate lines of oral and written communication, and what is expected of each employee in the normal course of  his  or  her  shift  help  minimize  problems. When problems do occur, a strong foundation in technical skills makes it easier for the employee to create alternative solutions for the guest.\n\nTraining draws on employees' EQ (emotional  quotient)  as  well  as  their  IQ  (intelligence quotient). CST requires that employees draw  on  their  ability  to  empathize  with  the guest. This  starts  by  training  employees  to suspend judgment of a situation, become attentive listeners, and know the right questions to ask. This allows them to understand what the actual problem is. Training employees in this  type of customer service delivery assists them in focusing on the salient issues and creating ways to address them.\n\nBecause  CST  is  ongoing, employees  can benefit from their peers' experiences.Vehicles to exchange this type of information can be as informal as role-playing and round-table discussions, or  as  structured  as  an  employee newsletter. Incentives, acknowledgments, and rewards for excellent customer service delivery  are  an  integral  part  of  the  training  program. Successful  CST  supports  a  skilled  and unified  staff, which  translates  into  profitable operations. CST is an investment in property that owners can't afford not to make.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

In a destination resort, where the reason for the spa facilities is the reason for the trip, there should be an average of 1 treatment room for every 4 to 5 guest  rooms. At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum, such as a casino hotel, the spa is definitely  an  amenity, and  1  treatment  room should  be  built  for  every  50  to  100  guest rooms.\n\nThe  spas  at  lower-end  hotel  properties normally  are  limited  in  scope  and  are  often between 3,000 and 6,000 square feet, whereas luxury  spas  at  full-service, high-end  resorts average  between  10,000  and  35,000  square feet. These ranges vary based on each hotel's specific  circumstances, including  seasonality, accessibility, meeting  space, fill  patterns, and local demand. Each market and each lodging product must be individually evaluated to assess the appropriate ratio of treatment rooms to guest rooms.\n\nAnother matrix that measures the viability of a resort or hotel spa is the cost to build the facility. Once again, a number of factors support various outcomes in this process, including the amount of available land, the finishes  of  the  spa, the  finishes  of  the  hotel (these should be compatible), and the need to develop a spa either vertically or horizontally. Vertical spas are most often built in environments  where  land  is  scarce  or  the  allocated footprint for the spa is too small for one floor. Vertical  construction  always  raises  the  price per square foot, as load distribution, drainage, and the weight of equipment and water must be factored into the construction design and budget. The cost to construct a resort or destination spa can range from as low as $200 per square foot to over $450 per square foot.

      "content": "To this point, we have evaluated the economics and use patterns of spa types. The focus of\n\nmost spas dictates how the space is allocated and  where  the  income  is  generated. Spas should aim to have at least 50 percent of their total space-their prime real estate-produce direct  revenue. Secondary  real  estate  is  the support and public areas necessary for atmosphere and supporting functions that assist in delivering the spa services. Secondary spa real estate  includes  areas  where  people  can  prepare  for  or  relax  from  their  spa  treatments. These secondary areas are an important component in the spa development plan, as they allow  guests  to  prolong  their  experience, which enhances the perceived value. If guests are hurried from their massage or facial out of the  spa  and  back  onto  the  street, the  magic that is  created  can  be  abruptly  snapped and the  overall  spa  experience  is  compromised. Conversely, if a guest is allowed to soak and relax  for  hours  after  a  body  wrap  is  completed, emotionally speaking, the cost of the body  wrap  is  amortized  over  the  entire  spa experience and not just for the time the client was enjoying the body wrap in the spa's prime real estate.\n\nCombination rooms account for about 36 percent  of  North  American  spa  spaces, but because of the various treatments offered in them, a  revenue  percentage  generated  from these spaces is hard to predict. Combination spaces allow the spa to address surges in demand for specific treatments and at the same time be flexible and respond to global market changes. Massage rooms account for approximately 27 percent of the total space in North American spas but 47 percent of the spa revenue. Given these factors, an operator would need a compelling reason to not include massage on the spa menu. Facial treatment areas reflect 19 percent of the total spa space and result in about 33 percent of the spa's overall revenue. Wet rooms, often the most underutilized  portions  of  the  spa, account  for  7  per-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncent of the space and revenue. Because many spa modalities involve water therapies, many spa  developers  and  owners  believe  that  wet rooms are essential, even if they seem underutilized. Because  wet  rooms  are  one  of  the most expensive components of a spa, it is essential that they be utilized to their fullest extent. Packaging  wet  room  treatments  with other spa services is one way to better utilize the space and create value for the spa.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Anti-aging  treatments  and  products are  driving  much  of  spa  menu  and  retail  development. This  calls  for  devoting  a  treatment room to outpatient medical procedures. Programming  and  spa  menu  items  include  sun damage  treatments, chemical  peels  for  skin renewal, and  other  rejuvenation  techniques that build on repeat procedures. Commensurately, spas are developing retail product lines that  can  take  the  spa  experience  home  and continue the wellness regime.\n\nGift  card  sales are  driving  new  users  to spas. In the friends and family sector as well as  the  corporate  gift-giving  world, day  spa certificates are creating demand that is not directly  user  driven. Third-party  purchasing brings to spas clients who may not normally have chosen the location or treatment, creating a large but undefinable market demand.\n\nRegional specialties that relate to indigenous and climatic influences continue to create unique spa experiences based on site-specific  supply. This  has  excellent  leverage potential for spa operators working to differentiate  their  product  matrices  in  densely operated areas.\n\nIncreased stress management. It is important to position services for stress relief, especially to  the  male  business  traveler. Spa programming that requires a limited amount of special equipment and minimal changes to a property's infrastructure can do this.\n\nImpulse appointments. 'Life is uncertain, but  I  want  a  massage  (reflexology  appointment, yoga class, etc.) now!' This trend may result in developing adjunct programs for oncall staff resources. The as-needed portion of the  program  limits  a  hotel's  payroll  burden and other related fixed costs. Of course, this implies  existing  core  programs  and  facilities where these programs can be developed and supported.\n\nShift in perspective. Self-indulgence, pampering, and luxury are being reevaluated and repackaged with a new, broader emphasis on self-care, stress  relief, and  emotional  balancing. This is reflected in spa programming, the menu of services, food and beverage outlets, and  spa-related  retail. The  retail  positioning and spa programming components represent huge untapped revenue opportunities.\n\nChanges in demographic use profile. Historically, the greatest segment of spa goers was women between the ages of 35 and 55. More couples  and  families  are  expected  to  visit the  spa  together  as  an  alternative  social/ recreational activity. This trend has the potential  to  extend  business-related  stays, fill  business hotels on  the  weekend, and  create demand for destinations. It is important to understand this trend when evaluating ways to increase market penetration in a down market.\n\nMedical affiliations. For some markets, an affiliation  with  a  medical  center  or  group  in the area can be established to provide treatments such as acupuncture, nutritional assessment, laser therapies  (hair  removal  and wrinkle reduction), Botox injections, collagen treatments, chemical  peels, laser  resurfacing,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbody  contouring, microderm  abrasion, and vascular  procedures. When  creating  these types of relationships, it  is  essential  that  spa owners  thoroughly  investigate  the  legal  disclosure and liability implications of being an affiliated medical service provider.\n\nGreen environments. A spa can be ecologically sensitive by incorporating environmentally friendly features into the operation. By proactively  supporting  programs  and  products  that  are  earth  friendly, the  spa  does something  good  for  the  environment, provides a service to the community, and creates a competitive advantage and a unique selling point that may provide significant returns, especially in a highly competitive market.\n\n",

      "title": "▶ CLASSIC ORGANIZATION",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "I n hotels in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century, the classic European hotel  organization  model  was  predominant. This structure was built around two major hotel managerial personalities: the chef and the maître d'hôtel. The chef was the chief or king of the kitchen. In many ways, he represented a feudal lord on his estate who held sway over everything that had to do with selection and preparation  of  food  in  the  hotel. This  structure  recognized  the  importance  of  the  role that food and its preparation played in the hotels of the time.\n\nSimilarly, the maître d'hôtel was the master  of  all  service  in  the  hotel. It  was  his  responsibility to manage the interaction of the hotel's staff and guests such that guests were always served promptly, properly, and in line\n\nwith the hotel's policy. Even the titles chef and maître d'hôtel, translated from the French as 'chief' and 'master  of  the  hotel,' suggest  a strong European influence. That these terms are still in use today attests to a continuing influence, but  the  roles  have  changed  and evolved. In  several  places  in  this  book, we consider the ways in which people, organizations, and  jobs  have  changed  in  the  hotel industry.\n\nFor many of the same reasons cited in the Introduction  as  to  why  the  management  of hotels has changed, hotel organization structures have also changed.As our knowledge of our  guests  and  the  markets  they  represent grew and became more precise, specialization within  the  hotel  organizational  structure  increased  the  effectiveness  with  which  the  organization managed and delivered its services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHotel organization structures are not immune to the influences of the economy and business  cycles, so  the  difficulties  that  befall business  in  general  during  economic  downturns  also  affect  hotel  organizations. Downsizing and reengineering are  terms  used  to describe  the  changes  hotel  companies  have undergone.\n\nIn the early 1990s, some hotels eliminated entire  levels  of  management  or  combined managerial responsibilities  to  flatten  the  organization. In  the  typical  functional  chart, such as that depicted in Figure 2.1, the executive  assistant  manager was often eliminated, making division heads directly responsible to the general manager (GM). Some hotels elim-\n\ninated  separate  managers  at  the  division level, with all department managers reporting directly to the GM.\n\nHowever the restructuring looks, organizations  are  still  formed  around  principles such as those outlined by Stoner and Wankel (1986). They said that the organizing process involves  balancing  a  company's  need  for both  stability  and  change. They  go  on  to comment  on  'organizing' as  a  multi-step process  based  on  that  proposed  by  Dale (1967):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the modern hotel organization, even a reengineered one, a linear line and staff structure has emerged to reflect this theoretical organizing process.\n\nNote also that in this chart the two major operating  divisions  are  identified  as Rooms Division and Food  and  Beverage  Division. Again, on a company-by-company basis, individual functions may find homes in various divisions, but  basically, hotel  organizations  are set  up  to  deliver  these  two  basic  services  to their guests: rooms and food and beverage.\n\nWhat  may  differ  in  a  given  hotel  company's  organization  is  the  placement  of  the other  departments. The  departments  on  this\n\norganization chart should be considered typical and illustrative of a generic hotel organization chart.\n\nFor purposes of illustration, the line and staff functions are defined as follows.\n\nFigure  2.1  depicts  a  typical  organization chart for a large hotel. Note that, with the exception of top managers, function rather than title identifies the departments.This is to indicate that job titles and associated duties vary from company to company,and,as noted, may be combined or eliminated to reflect current conditions. Looking at an organizational chart by function rather than by job title allows an industrywide  perspective, for  the  services  a hotel delivers remain the same even through financial emergencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

The line operations in a hotel  organization  are  the  Rooms  Division and Food and Beverage Division.

The  underlying  commonalty  is that  most  line  employees are hands-on participants in the assembly and delivery of the hotel's services.\n\nFor  instance, under  most  circumstances, members of the hotel's security staff do not have  regular  guest  contact; housekeeping staff may have somewhat more guest contact, and housekeepers are obviously major participants  in  the  production  of  the  hotel's  services. However, in  the  Rooms  Division, the front  office  staff  has  the  vast  majority  of highly  visible  face-to-face  contact  with  the guest.\n\nSimilarly, in the Food and Beverage Division, the  employees  of  the  restaurants, bars, room service, and banquet departments have a  tremendous  amount  of  face-to-face  guest interaction. Like the housekeeping staff, however, only under special and irregular circumstances does the food production staff under the hotel chef interact with guests.

The success of the engineering function heavily  influences  the  quality  of  the  guest's  stay and, at the same time, the engineering department supports the activities  of  almost  every other department in the hotel.\n\nFor instance, the engineering department maintains and repairs equipment that is crucial to all of the hotel's line functions, including  the  food  production  equipment  in  the kitchen. Engineering staff can be called on to repair  the  tables  and  chairs  in  the  dining room, the furniture in the lobby, and the carts the  bellhops  use  to  transport  guest  luggage. The engineering department thus can be considered  a  true  staff  department  that  serves and supports at any given time any or all of the other departments in the hotel.\n\nOther  hotel  organization  charts  place the  engineering  department  in  the  Rooms Division. This may be because that is where engineering works best in the hotel's organization, or  perhaps  this  placement  is  only tradition.\n\nThis situation may also be true for other departments traditionally thought of as Rooms Division functions. Security is one example. In  some  organizations, housekeeping has  been  changed  to  a  staff  function  rather than strictly rooms, for housekeeping, by definition, 'keeps' the entire house.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I f the efforts of people in organizations are to be channeled toward productive ends, structure  must  be  given  to  their  activities. Aldag and  Stearns  (1987)  list  five  ways  by  which managers give structure to organizations:\n\nWhenever a manager decides to make an organizational change, he or she usually must take these five elements into account.\n\nSpecialization. If  there is more than one way  to  accomplish  something, management must make a conscious decision about how to divide tasks among workers. At one extreme is the case of little or no specialization, where an individual worker is responsible for all of the tasks required to complete a job. An example is the chef in a small country restaurant who singlehandedly prepares an entire meal for 20 guests. It's rewarding to have total control over a project and motivating to see the results of one's efforts.The problem, however, is that as demand for products or services increases, it  becomes  more  and  more  difficult for  individuals  or  small  groups  to  increase their  output  without  changing  the  way  they are organized.\n\nOne of management's tasks  is  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  work  and  jobs should be specialized. As a general rule, specialization holds out the possibility of greater worker productivity and managerial control over tasks. On the other hand, dividing complete  jobs  into  smaller  subunits  tends  to  increase the need for coordinating the activities of numerous workers, each involved\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin  separate, specialized  tasks. Also, overspecialization  can  result  in  jobs  so  narrow  that workers lose interest, motivation drops, error rates increase, and quality suffers.\n\nDepartmentalization. As  organizations grow  in  size, managers  are  faced  with  the need to group certain jobs in order to ensure efficient  coordination  and  control  of  activities. Most  restaurants  departmentalize, with food preparation and food service as separate functional departments. This is a logical and practical solution. Preparing and serving food is achieved through distinctly different kinds of work; both the process and the function of the  two  activities  are  different. Forming  departments along functional lines  is  the  most common method of organizing a business.\n\nAuthority. Every time managers restructure  a  job  or  group  into  different  departments, they  are  faced  with  the  question  of how much decision-making authority to grant individual  workers, managers, or  departments. Organizations  are  never  totally  centralized or decentralized  with  regard  to decision making; rather, they tend toward one direction  or  the  other. A  number  of  factors must  be  taken  into  account  when  deciding what pattern of authority is best for an organization. Managers must take into consideration the experience and personality of subordinates, the environment in which they work (Is  it  stable  or  rapidly  changing?), the business strategy to be followed, and the management  style  with  which  they  feel  most comfortable.\n\nLine  executives  have  responsibility  for business  units  that  provide  products  or  services  to  customers  and  account  for  the  revenues of  the  business. In  a  hotel, the  rooms and food and beverage departments account for most revenue. On the other hand, staff departments are set up because the principles of\n\nwork specialization  and  departmentalization suggest  efficiencies  from  such  an  organizational design. The personnel and engineering departments of a hotel are examples of staff units. Once set up, however, staff departments sometimes cause organizational problems.\n\nHow  much  authority  should  functional staff executives have over line executives? At one  extreme, line  executives  could  be  given total authority. At the other extreme, staff executives, in  their  specialty  areas, could  be granted  authority  over  line  executives. Two intermediate  examples: (1)  Line  executives are  required  to  consult  with  staff  specialists before  making  a  decision; and  (2)  line  and staff executives are required to make joint decisions.Whatever the situation, top executives like  GMs  must  arbitrate  line-staff  disputes when they develop.\n\nSpan of Control. Span of control relates to the number of subordinates reporting to a supervisor. In  the  past, some  management scholars advocated an 'ideal' span of control of exactly seven subordinates. That simplistic view is no longer held. The ideal span of control is dependent on:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSome of these factors may work in opposite directions. For example, fast food restaurants  are  operationally  quite  similar  to  each other, suggesting  a  broad  span  of  control. However, their  physical  dispersion  works  in the  (opposite)  direction  of  limiting  span  of control.\n\nCoordination of Activities. Problems arise when  organizations  do  not  properly  coordinate their activities. In simple organizations of only a few people, coordination is usually not a major concern. Problems develop, however, as organizations grow in complexity. As previously discussed, work  specialization and departmentalization  are  organizational  responses to the growth of a business. As duties are subdivided, it becomes increasingly important to coordinate the activities of individuals and groups toward common goals.The kind of coordination required depends on how tasks and activities are linked. These linkages result in different kinds of interdependence between individuals and groups.\n\nPooled interdependence refers to activities that can be performed with little interaction between individuals or groups. Suppose a hotel  has  three  telephone  operators. Each  can usually  perform  the  required  duties  independently-that  is, without  any  interaction with  the  others-as  can  room  maids  and cashiers at food outlets. Because these workers  need  not  interact  among  themselves, coordination of their activities is best accomplished  by  prescribing  standardized rules and procedures for each to follow, by intensive individual training, and by direct su-\n\npervision. The  role  of  coordination  is  to  ensure that each independently performed task is  carried  out  at  the  same  level  of  efficiency and quality.\n\nSequential  interdependence occurs  when one task's output is a second task's input.This is typical of production line operations where products are progressively assembled.A hotel example  is  the  guest  check-in  process. The output  of  a  front  desk  becomes  an  input  to the  accounting  department  in  the  form  of  a guest  billing  record  or  folio. A  well-planned system linking the rooms department and the accounting department is vital for this activity to  go  smoothly. Proper  coordination  is  ensured through detailed planning, scheduling, and  standardization. Coordination  also  requires identification of the linkages that exist between activities.\n\nStill  greater  coordination  is  required  in cases where the output of Unit A is input for Unit B and the output of Unit B is input for Unit A. Whenever there is a high level of interaction between work units, they are said to exhibit reciprocal  interdependence. One  example  is  the  coordination  needed  to  host  a major  convention. Rooming  decisions  made by  the  front  desk  must  be  coordinated  with accounting, sales, housekeeping, and reservations; function  room  usage  requires  interactions among convention services, engineering, food and beverage, and accounting. Because any one department's output and activity affect numerous other departments, mutual adjustments are required. Close coordination is only  possible  through  direct  communication and  joint  decision  making  by  the  units  involved. While standardized plans and procedures are helpful, they cannot possibly solve all of the problems resulting from such a high degree  of  departmental  interaction. Direct communication  and  group  meetings  are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nneeded to ensure proper coordination when activities involve reciprocal interdependence.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "E xperience  has  accumulated  for  centuries about  how  to  organize  institutions  such  as government  bureaucracies, the  military, religions, large  commercial  trading  companies, and, since  the  industrial  revolution, large manufacturing  concerns. This  experience  is distilled  in  a  number  of  principles  that  have been identified. While these principles do not hold in all circumstances, they are important and should be understood and applied where appropriate.\n\nChain of Command. This principle holds that everyone in an organization should have a superior to whom he or she is responsible.A hotel's organizational chart depicts the chain of  command. It  should  be  possible  for  any employee to trace his or her way up the organization  chart's  chain  of  command  all  the way to the GM. The typical pyramid shape of an organization chart is a consequence of the chain  of  command  and  the  span  of  control concept discussed  previously. Chain  of  command is a powerful concept. It provides structure  in  an  organization  by  setting  forth  a system of subordinate-superior accountability for everyone.\n\nThe chain of command affects communication within organizations for both subordinates and superiors. If a GM wants to make a change  in  housekeeping, chain-of-command considerations  mean  he  or  she  should  communicate  with  the  rooms  department  manager, who in turn will speak to the director of\n\nhousekeeping. The traditional chain-ofcommand structure in a hotel has the baker responsible to the chef and the chef responsible  to  the  food  and  beverage  director. Accordingly, the  baker  should  communicate with the chef and not directly with the food and beverage director.\n\nToo strict an adherence to this principle, however, can take away the spontaneity in an organization. Experienced  hotel  GMs  often break this principle, but in a way that is not harmful to the hotel. The immediacy of some problems in hotels sometimes requires hotel executives to issue orders directly to subordinates two or more levels down in the organization. GMs  may  also  want  to  maintain personal control over some project or aspect of the hotel and choose to bypass immediate subordinates in order to do so. This does little harm as long as everyone knows what is happening and the organizational climate is otherwise healthy and trusting.\n\nUnity of Command. This principle states that each employee is responsible to one and only  one  superior-that  is, each  person  has only one boss. Unity of command is violated quite regularly in most organizations.A safety officer who reports to the personnel director might correct a food server, whose boss is the restaurant manager, for a safety violation.The server feels as if she has two bosses and, in effect, she  does. This  common problem occurs as organizations grow in size and task specialization takes place. Specialists in safety (or accounting, personnel, data  processing, and  so on) often do have authority, in their specialty area, over workers who do not report directly to them through the chain of command. Problems  can  develop  because  of  conflicting  orders from more than one boss. The solution is not necessarily to eliminate specialization and staff positions but rather to ensure, by closely\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncoordinating activities, that order rather than confusion reigns. The GM plays a key role in coordination throughout the hotel.\n\nDelegation. Young  managers  often  find delegation a difficult task to master. A subordinate's ability to successfully carry out an assignment depends in part on the clarity of his or her superior's delegation instructions. Delegation can range from assigning a minor task to a subordinate to granting complete responsibility for a major undertaking. It's important for  both superior and subordinate to understand and agree on the level of responsibility, the freedom of action, and the amount of authority that accompanies a delegated task.\n\nEach level of delegation is useful in different  circumstances. Here  are  examples  of orders  that  result  in  different  degrees  of delegation:\n\nThe extent to which authority is delegated depends in part on the experience of the subordinate. Young, inexperienced  subordinates can expect only limited delegation until they have  proven  themselves. The  amount  of  authority  delegated  usually  increases  as  trust between superior and subordinate is built.\n\nIt's been said that when a person becomes a manager, he or she gives up earning an hon-\n\nest living. Hotel managers don't usually make beds, cook food, or provide service directly to guests. Rather, their job is to see to it that the organization  they  manage  provides  proper guest services.\n\n",

      "content": "I ndividual hotels are usually organized along functional  lines, with  departments  grouped according  to  the  particular  work  activity  in which they are engaged. Figure 2.2 depicts a typical organization chart for a 500-room hotel. The hotel is divided along functional lines into  five  administrative  departments: rooms, food and beverage, accounting, sales, and personnel. The five department heads report directly  to  the  GM. As Figure 2.2 shows, each department is subdivided into smaller organizational  units. These  subdivisions  represent refinements  of  the  work  performed  and  the knowledge  and  skills  of  the  people  in  each subunit.\n\nThe Rooms Department. The rooms department performs the lodging function of a hotel. Reservations must be accepted, guests must  be  hospitably  received  and  assigned clean rooms, the status of available and occupied rooms must be kept current, guests must receive  mail  and  phone  messages  promptly, security  must  be  maintained, public  spaces such as lobbies must be kept clean, and guest questions must be answered. These are some of  the  important  functions  of  the  rooms  department. The  rooms  department  is  divided into a number of subunits, each of which performs  rather  specialized  tasks.

      "content": "Figure 2.2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndepartments. For  example, the  laundry  department, which in a 500-room hotel is quite large, is responsible for cleaning and pressing all the hotel's linens and employee uniforms as  well  as  guest  laundry. Its  function  is  extremely  specialized. Little  of  the  knowledge and skills required to manage a laundry operation are transferable to other areas of hotel operations.\n\nThe  front  office  is  where  guests  are greeted when they arrive at the hotel, where they're registered, and where they're assigned to  a  room. Telephone  operators  and  other guest  communications  functions  usually  fall under the front office department.The hotel's bell  staff is also  part  of  this  department. Reservations  takes  and  tracks  hotel's  future bookings. The  housekeeping  department  is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nresponsible  for  cleaning  guest  rooms  and public spaces. Security is responsible for guest safety. Finally, the engineering department is responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance of the hotel's entire physical plant, including  electrical, mechanical, heating, air conditioning  and  ventilation, structure, and plumbing. It also performs minor repairs and renovations.\n\nA  great  deal  of  interdependence  exists between  the  subunits  of  the  rooms  department, thus  calling  for  close  coordination  of activities. Linkages exist between the front office and the reservations department. Reservations  must  inform  the  front  office  of  the number of presold rooms each day to ensure that a current inventory of rentable rooms is always  available. The  front  office  must  let reservations  know  whenever  walk-in  guests (those  without  reservations)  are  registered. Linkages also exist  between  the  front  office and  housekeeping. Information  regarding room  status  must  flow  both  ways: When  a guest checks out, the front office must inform housekeeping  so  the  room  may  be  cleaned. Once it is cleaned, housekeeping must inform the  front  office  so  the  room  may  be  sold. These are both examples of reciprocal interdependence in which individual units provide each other with inputs. Other linkages within the  rooms  department  are  illustrative  of  sequential interdependence, which occurs when the output of one unit becomes the input of another. An  example  is  housekeeping's  inability to properly provision a guest room if the  laundry  does  not  supply  enough  clean towels or bedsheets. A less obvious example deals with the output of information from one department  to  another. For  example, engineering  cannot  replace  a  defective  light switch in a guest room if housekeeping does not report the problem. These examples illus-\n\ntrate  the  reciprocal  and  sequential  interdependence that exists between subunits of the rooms  department. Effective  management under these conditions calls for standardized plans, procedures, schedules, and  deadlines. Coordination  between  units  also  requires frequent  direct  communications  between executives.\n\nThe Food and Beverage Department. The primary  function  of  the  food  and  beverage department is, of course, to provide food and drink to a hotel's guests. In earlier times, when an inn had only one dining room, this was a much simpler task. Today, however, providing food  and  drink  is  much  more  complicated. The 500-room hotel in this discussion might well have a coffee shop, a gourmet restaurant, a poolside snack bar, room service, two banquet  halls, and  ten  separate  function  rooms where food and beverage may be served. It might  also  have  a  piano  bar  and  lounge, a nightclub, and a lobby bar. This adds up to 19 food  and  beverage  outlets, excluding  room service!  On  a  busy  day  (or  night), it's  likely that each of these outlets will be used. Often, more than one event takes place in an outlet during a 24-hour period.\n\nThere  is  great  diversity  in  the  activities performed  by  a  food  and  beverage  department and considerable variety in the skills required, so the department  comprised  a number  of  functional  subunits  where  tasks are  specialized. To  begin  with, there  is  the food production, or kitchen, department. In a 500-room hotel, this unit is headed by the executive chef, a person of great stature and authority in a first-class hotel. Under  the executive chef are a variety of culinary specialists  responsible  for  different  aspects  of food preparation. The service of food in a hotel's  restaurants  and  food  outlets  is  usually the  responsibility  of  a  separate  department,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhich, in a large hotel, is headed by an assistant  food  and  beverage  director. The  food service  department  contains  the  individual restaurant  and  outlet  managers, maître  d's, waiters, waitresses, and bus help. Because of the  special  problems  associated  with  room service, many  large  hotels  have  a  separate subunit  responsible  only  for  room  service. The high value and profit margins associated with alcoholic beverages cause hotels to form a separate department with responsibility for the bars, lounges, service bars, and other alcoholic  beverage  outlets. Most  full-service  hotels do considerable convention and catering business. A  convention  uses  small  function rooms for separate meetings, larger rooms for general sessions, and even larger facilities for banquets. Catered  events  include  local  parties, wedding  receptions, business  meetings, and other affairs held by local groups. To provide for the unique needs of these customers, hotels  often  organize  separate  catering  and convention departments that specialize in this kind  of  business. Finally, the  job  of  cleaning the spaces of the food and beverage department, dish-  and  warewashing, and  general food  and  beverage  expediting  is  often  assigned  to  a  separate  subunit  known  as  the stewarding department.\n\nSales and Marketing. This department is quite  small, making  intradepartmental  coordination  fairly  easy. Also, the  department  is removed  from  most  day-to-day  operational problems  faced  by  other  departments. Still, there is a division of work among sales managers, usually based on the type of customers a  hotel  is  attempting  to  attract. Individual sales  managers  often  specialize  in  corporate accounts, conventions, or tour and travel markets. Sales  managers  are  sometimes  further subdivided  along  geographical  lines  such  as regional  or  national  accounts. Still, the  sales\n\nstaff, even  for  a  1,000-room  hotel, usually does not exceed a dozen or so members. Sales managers work more or less independently in their particular market segments. Thus, problems  of  intradepartmental  interdependence are usually not severe (Pelletier 1988).\n\nPersonnel. A  hotel's  personnel  department is a staff organization set up to handle a specialized  function. It  serves  no  customers, books no business, and prepares no meals, yet it plays a vital role in a hotel's efficient operation. In Figure 2.2, the personnel department is subdivided  into  three  subfunctions: employee  recruitment, benefits  administration, and training. The personnel director must be an  expert  on  labor  law  and  able  to  advise managers in other departments. While these three  subfunctions  are  related, they  do  not present  many  problems  of  interdependence. Instead, the  personnel  department's  major challenge  occurs  as  it  attempts  to  interact with other hotel departments. Personnel may recruit, interview, and screen prospective employees, but  final  hiring  authority  resides  in the line departments. The same is true of promotion and disciplinary decisions, where the personnel department's input is advisory only. As a staff department, personnel's effectiveness  is  largely  dependent  on  its  manager's ability to form effective working relationships with other departments.\n\nAccounting. The  accounting  department often combines both staff and line functions. Its traditional  role  is  recording  financial transactions, preparing  and  interpreting  financial  statements, and  providing  management with timely reports of operating results. Responsibilities also include payroll preparation, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. These functions are the responsibility of  the  assistant  controller  for  finance. There is, however, another dimension to the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naccounting department that connects to operations, cost  accounting, and  cost  control throughout the hotel. This often results in the department being called the controllers'  department rather than the accounting department.The two central concerns of accounting control are rooms and food and beverage.The accounting  department's  front  office  cashier tracks all charges to guest accounts. The night auditor  reconciles  all  guest  bills  with  the charges from the various hotel departments. Although these employees work at the front desk  and  sometimes  have  direct  guest  contact, they are members of the accounting department and report to the assistant controller for operations.\n\nThe food and beverage controller, and the food and beverage cashiers, who work in the accounting department, keep track of the revenues and expenses of the food and beverage department. Food and beverage cashiers report to the assistant controller for operations, and the food and beverage controller reports directly to the hotel controller. The food and beverage department may be responsible for food  preparation  and  service, but  the  accounting  department  is  responsible  for  collecting  revenues!  The  food  and  beverage controller  verifies  the  accuracy  and  reasonableness  of  all  food  and  beverage  revenues. The accounting department is responsible for tracking  and  preparing  daily  reports  on  the costs of the food and beverage used in the hotel. In many cases, the accounting department is  also  responsible  for  purchasing  and storeroom operations. Finally, the director of systems is responsible for designing the accounting  and  management  information systems used throughout the hotel. This discussion demonstrates the accounting department's  direct involvement  in  day-to-day operational aspects of the hotel.\n\nWe make two final points about the accounting department. First, accounting is responsible for collecting and reporting most of a hotel's operational and financial statistics. It therefore plays an important hotelwide staff role as data provider for decision-making and budget  preparation. Second, the  accounting department  head  is  responsible  not  only  to the hotel's GM but also to the hotel chain's financial vice president or to the hotel's owner. The  reason  for  this  dual  reporting  relationship is to provide the hotel corporation an independent verification of the accuracy of the financial and operating results of the hotelthat is, independent from the GM. Thus, unity of command is routinely violated in the case of hotel controllers.\n\n",

      "content": "T he  reason  for  organizing  a  business  along functional  lines  is  to  group  employees  who perform  similar  tasks  or  have  similar  skills. The strength of a hotel's functional organizational design is the resulting efficiency within individual  departments  or  subunits. Performance  of  common  tasks  allows  for  work specialization, which  increases  overall  productivity. Because  functional  departments perform  similar  tasks, workers  rapidly  develop specialized skills and knowledge. Training is easier because of task similarity and the many opportunities for inexperienced workers  to  learn  from  experienced  workers. This helps new employees quickly learn the skills and behavioral patterns that lead to success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA functional organization is a logical way to organize work because it fosters efficiency, teamwork, and  coordination  within  departments. However, the functional design's most important  strength  is  also  the  source  of  its greatest shortcoming.The success of a hotel is measured by its overall performance, not the performance of one department.A functional department's strength lies in its ability to focus on its own tasks and activities. Although this is surely important for departmental efficiency, it does not necessarily ensure the overall effectiveness of a hotel. Because they are specialized, it is sometimes difficult for functional departments to fully appreciate the relationship between their performance and the overall  performance  and  goals  of  the  hotel. All  departments  must  keep  hotelwide  goals of customer service and profitability in mind rather than focus narrowly on their own concerns. A method must be found to coordinate the activities of individual departments and to set  hotelwide  strategies  and  goals. Left  to themselves, it  is  unlikely  that  individual  departments  would  be  capable  of  doing  this. Specialization at the department and subdepartment levels results in the need for leadership at the top of an organization. Someone above  the  departments  must  set  the  overall strategic  course  of  the  hotel, set  hotelwide goals, coordinate  activities  between  departments, and  arbitrate  interdepartmental  disputes. A  hotel's functional organization demands strong leadership at the top.\n\nWhile  functional  departments  produce specialists within a narrow skill category, they do  not  develop  executives  with  broad  hotel exposure. Consider  the  heads  of  a  hotel's marketing  and  food  and  beverage  departments. These two executives might only have superficial  knowledge  of  each  other's  specialty. Their  education  and  work  experience\n\nare likely so different that either would be at a loss if placed in the other's department. The director  of  sales  might  have  a  marketing  or general business degree and spend a career in sales-related work.The food and beverage director, on the other hand, could have a culinary diploma and a hospitality degree, extensive food production and service experience, and little or no sales experience. One often finds accountants running the controller's office, engineers in charge of engineering and maintenance, individuals with degrees in personnel administration heading the personnel department, and  a  variety  of  educational backgrounds among rooms managers.\n\nManagers  educated  in  hotel  administration  are  capable  of  filling  most  department head slots. The  longer  managers  stay  in  one department, the  more  narrowly  specialized they become. While a manager may perform well within one department, he or she may be unprepared to address problems that require a hotelwide knowledge and perspective. Narrow specialization can result in bias, mistrust, and friction between departments unless upper management takes steps to counter this. Individual departments may pursue their own narrow interests rather than broader overall goals  and  objectives  (Dann  and  Hornsey 1986). This is a particular problem for hotels because of the need for close interdepartmental cooperation in providing guest services.\n\n",

A  well-thought-out  set  of standard  operating  procedures  and  systems\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncan  decrease  the  chances  of  many  routine mistakes. Still, because  of  the  amount  of  reciprocal interdependence that exists between departments, close  cooperation  is  a  must. Nowhere is this more important than at the department-head  level, where  differences  in functional specialties are most extreme (Dann and Hornsey, 1986). The vehicle often used to foster cooperation between functionally specialized departments is the executive operating committee (EOC).\n\nThe  Executive  Operating  Committee. The EOC is made up of the GM and other hotel senior executives.There's no magic formula for EOC membership, but usually it's those  executives  who  report  directly  to  the GM.Thus, the EOC consists of the most senior members of a hotel's management staff: the heads of the functional departments who report directly to the GM and are responsible for the hotel's major budgetary units. A subgroup  of  these  executives-the  GM, rooms manager, sales  and  marketing  director, food  and  beverage  director, and  controller-usually produce the hotel's occupancy, revenue, and profit forecasts for each year. These forecasts form the basis for the hotel's overall annual budget, and meeting  annual  budget  goals  determines  executive bonuses.\n\nThe exact duties of an EOC vary from hotel to hotel. The duties and responsibilities of groups can be spelled out in detail or left ambiguous. A hotel's EOC can be loosely structured  or  highly  structured. An  important question GMs must answer is the amount of authority they wish to delegate to the EOC. Depending  on  the  circumstances, one  EOC might be structured to make certain group decisions, a second to play a strong though consultative role to the GM, and a third to have a weak or nonexistent decision-making role.\n\nQuite apart from decision making, EOCs play an important communications  role within hotels. This occurs by virtue of the fact that EOC members meet regularly to discuss hotel  business. Any  time  meetings  are  held, communication takes place. Scott and Mitchell  (1976)  identify  four  functions  of communication:\n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  all  four  of these  functions  of  communication  may  take place  during  meetings. Meeting  frequency, agenda, and the amount of decision making delegated to an EOC depend on a variety of factors. The  more  participative  the  GM's management style, the more likely the EOC is engaged in joint decision making. Authoritarian  GMs  find  little  need  to  foster  a  strong EOC.The greater the need for change within a hotel, the more likely it is that EOC meetings  are  frequent. The  less  experienced  the hotel's  department  heads, the  more  helpful frequent EOC meetings are because they can serve as a learning and training vehicle for inexperienced managers.\n\nUnder the influence of a skilled GM, the EOC can play an important role. Some of the ways it may be useful are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "Well-managed hotels address the need for coordination of activities through an elaborate structure  of  committees  and  meetings. Just like  a  hotel's  organization  chart, these  committees and meetings constitute a formal part of a hotel's organizational structure. The GM usually  prescribes  a  hotel's  committee  and meeting structure. Each group's responsibilities are  spelled  out  (sometimes  in  great detail), regular  meeting  schedules  are  promulgated, and  minutes  are  often  taken  and distributed to participants and to higher-level executives, including the GM. The committee and meeting structure of a hotel should be a well-thought-out part of its formal organizational structure.\n\nThe  purposes  of  the  committees  and meetings in a hotel vary with the complexity of the hotel. They address a range of concerns including daily operations; intradepartmental and interdepartmental issues; hotelwide concerns; and financial, personnel, and marketing issues. Table 2.1 lists the regularly scheduled meetings  of  a  typical  large  hotel. While  not the  meeting  schedule  for  an  actual  hotel, it could be. It will pay dividends to review this list carefully. The meetings a hotel holds provide clues about what it takes to manage it.\n\nOne  of  the  first  things  to  note  is  the sheer  number  and  diversity  of  meetings. Surely, one might say that if a hotel were to hold  all  of  these  meetings, there  would  be little time left over to do any work! In fact, the effective management of hotels requires frequent meetings.They are part of the work of the hotel. Table 2.1 shows an average of 249  scheduled  meetings  each  year  dealing with interdepartmental issues. Also, the GM attends  295  regularly  scheduled  meetings each year. In many hotels, this is the actual case.\n\nThere  is  no  denying  that  meetings  are time-consuming  and  sometimes  unproductive. Still, there  doesn't  seem  to  be  a  better way  to  effectively  manage  a  hotel  (Conlin 1989). One often finds frustrated, dissatisfied executives in hotels where there are too few meetings. These  executives  complain  about not being kept informed of what is going on. As elementary as it may seem, it is easy for a hotel to fail to keep its managers and employees  adequately  informed. This  shortcoming can have disastrous consequences for the attitude and morale of a hotel's staff. A second complaint relates to service breakdowns that occur as a consequence of too few meetings. Hotels are subject to frequent, usually daily, changes. Meetings  must  be  scheduled  frequently in such an environment, or their effectiveness is lost. Too few meetings results in confusion over a hotel's goals and objectives. People need to know what is important to the hotel. What does it value most? What does it stand  for?  What  constitutes  good  performance? Because hotels provide many intangible services, a constant effort must be made at all  levels  to  provide  answers  to  these  questions. Meetings are an effective means of accomplishing  this  vital  management  function (Hosansky, 1989).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 2.1 Typical Meetings Structure for a Major Hotel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHotels are businesses that require an extraordinary  degree  of  interdepartmental  cooperation  in  order  to  provide  high-quality guest  service. The  functional  organizational design used in most hotels fosters efficiencies within each department of a hotel but is weak with respect to coordination between departments. One  of  the  organizing  strategies  em-\n\nployed to overcome this problem is a formal meeting structure designed to foster interdepartmental communication and cooperation. Thus, an important part of management's organizing  function  is  to  design  an  effective meeting  structure  that  compensates  for  and complements  a  hotel's  functionally  departmentalized organization.\n\n",

I call this a reverse organizational  chart; it  is  also  referred  to  as an organizational  pyramid -and, as you can see, the GM is on the bottom of the hierarchy.\n\nAt the top is the customer. Customers are the  reason  we  are  here. This  focus  on  our guests creates alignment throughout the hotel. Our mission is to ensure that every guest leaves satisfied and wants to return, thus ensuring  customer  loyalty. One  of  Marriott's fundamental beliefs is: 'If you take good care of  your  employees, the  employees  will  take good care of your customers.' This belief is at the core of who we are and what we believe in as a company.\n\nI say that we have two types of customers: external  customers-our  guests-and  internal customers, who are the hotel's associates. I  don't  use  the  term employee but  have  replaced it with the word associate. The difference  is  that  employees  work for you  and associates  work with you. Associate implies partnership and working together, which is a\n\nsubtle but powerful message. Employee suggests a class structure wherein someone is always  organizationally  inferior  to  someone else.\n\nIt is my belief that the front line associate is the most important person in the hotel, because he or she serves the customer.

We set the  tone  for  outstanding  service, which  requires a lot of coaching and leadership.\n\nPutting the GM at the bottom of the pyramid shows that the leader actually works for the people who work with the leader.

      "content": "In  most  companies, someone  who  has  attained the title of general manager (GM) or something  similar  heads  the  organization. Most of us in the hotel field consider this job the acme of one's career. In many hotel companies, the  job  serves  as  the  springboard  to corporate jobs or larger and more prestigious properties.\n\nIn previous editions of this book, I noted how surprising it is that so little has been written  about  hotel  general  managers. Little structured attention was paid to the development  of  their  careers  and  the  skills  and strengths  they  bring  to  their  jobs. Strangely, this is still the case.\n\nA  1981  article  by  Arnaldo  presented  a statistical  profile  of  hotel  general  managers. Arnaldo  drew  a  demographic  picture  of  his sample  ( n = 194)  and  commented  that  although GMs changed jobs frequently, they re-\n\nported  a  high  degree  of  job  satisfaction. He also provided an analytical framework for reporting  how  these  GMs  allocated  time  and importance to a number of classic managerial roles. The most important of the managerial roles ranked by the GMs were (in descending importance): leader, entrepreneur, monitor, and disseminator, with six others (figurehead, liaison, spokesman, disturbance  handler, resource  allocator, and  negotiator)  assuming less importance (see also Mintzberg, 1973).\n\nReaders  of  Arnaldo's  article  may  be struck by the similarities that echo in Nebel and Ghei's contribution here. Another useful comparison  can  be  made  by  reading  Arnaldo's work with that of David Ley (1980). This work, based on a small sample of seven GMs in comparable properties  in  one  hotel company, recorded how much time the GMs allocated to the same managerial work roles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Mintzberg, 1973). The  difference  here  was that Ley asked for a corporate office rating of each GM's effectiveness. He compared the effectiveness ratings (highly effective, effective, and less effective) to the observed time allocations of the GMs to leadership and entrepreneurial  activities. Ley  concluded  that  in this small group, the more effective managers spent more time on entrepreneurial activities than  leadership  activities. In  contrast, Arnaldo's  much  larger  group  of  GMs  devoted much more time to leadership than entrepreneurship. This  should  suggest  to  the  reader some interesting  questions  about  what  sorts of  activities  might  best  prepare  future  GMs for that role.\n\nThis makes the Nebel and Ghei piece all the  more  interesting, for  while  still  a  small group, their GMs were studied intensely, and the  authors  propose  a  structural  framework from which to view the job of GM. If you will, it is a hotel general manager theory that can be used to explain, predict, or control the position of GM.\n\nA  central  aspect  of  career  development among GMs is explored by Rutherford  and Wigenstein (1985), which looked for the first time at the role of mentoring as it could be measured  to  affect  the  success  and  satisfaction of a modern hotel GM's career.\n\nAlthough  the  demographic, salary, and operational data in that article are out of date, the focus of the research can still be useful to those who aspire to the top job in a hotel organization.Also, because the literature on hotel GMs is so sparse, the insights gained from the  managers  studied  in  this  case  add  flesh and tone to the work of the other authors included  in  this  section. In  the  mentoring  research, Rutherford and Wigenstein conclude that there is ample evidence that seeking out\n\nand  developing  mentoring  relationships  can have a positive effect on several aspects of a GM's career.\n\nAnother view of the career and personal aspects  of  the  GM's  job  is  discussed  by Pavesic  and  Brymer  (1990). In  a  number  of studies  in  recent  years, they  have  looked  at the  roles  job  satisfaction  and  stress  play  in managerial careers. In a review of this technical research, the authors interpret the behavioral  dimensions  of  the  GM's  career, work values, and personal challenges. Hotel careers are challenging, but as these researchers point out, they do not have to be arduous.\n\nIn the research  reported  by  Woods, Schmidgall, Sciarini, and  me, we  sought  answers to questions regarding the importance of  various  operational  measures, and  at  the same time asked GMs for suggestions about the  structure  of  a  hotel-related  education. Students reading this article find solid suggestions from successful GMs, as the sample for the study was drawn from mostly upscale and luxury  hotels  with  more  than  500  rooms. Much of the financial data are out of date, but many of the conclusions are still viable.\n\nIn an interesting new article, Beth ChungHerrera and her colleagues study the specific skills and competencies demonstrated by successful hotel leaders. The model they develop can be useful to hotel organizations, schools, and  professionals  crafting  the  structure  of successful careers.\n\nSpeaking of success, the three professionals who contribute their thoughts on the job of GM have attained that level in separate areas of the country and for different types of organizations. The employment circumstances  of  each  have  also  changed  since  the previous edition.\n\nPreviously the GM of the Rosen Centre\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHotel  in  Orlando, Florida, Emilio  Fabico  is now in the management structure of the Disney World Resort complex, also in Orlando. His  perspectives  from  the  standpoint  of  the GM and as a member of a management team do not necessarily change. Speaking through his  writing like he was a guest in your class, Mr. Fabico shares his insights about management in this fascinating industry.\n\nIn  the  third  edition  of  this  book, Rob Balmer shared his experiences as the GM of a DoubleTree Club Hotel in Las Vegas. DoubleTree is part of the Hilton family of hotel products. Since then, he has managed another  DoubleTree  in  California  and  was recently promoted to GM of the Hilton Burbank Airport and Convention Center Hotel, moving  up  in  complexity  and  responsibility.

This article, based on the research of one of the authors into hotel general managers' effectiveness, presents the viewpoint that the job of a hotel general manager can be better understood by analyzing the influences that shape it. The two major contextual elements that influence the job are deemed to be job demands and relationship issues.They differ depending on the time frame (short-run, intermediate-run, or long-run) under consideration. These two elements give rise to specific job functions and concomitantly suggest various managerial work roles that must be performed in each job function. Finally, the importance of the communications requirement for being effective in the job is emphasized. Key Words: Job demands, relationship issues, time frame, job functions, managerial work roles, communications requirement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMajor  hotels  of  today  are  diverse, multifaceted, and fast-paced businesses engaged in a wide  variety  of  operational  activities. Their organizational and operational complexity increases  with  size. A  hotel, irrespective  of whether  it  is  an  independent  or  part  of  a chain, can  be  managed  as  a  separate, independent business entity. Thus, each individual hotel  can, in  effect, be  treated  as  a  unique profit  center. While  it  takes  more  than  one person to effectively manage a hotel, the executive with overall operational responsibility for this business is the general manager (GM) of the hotel. 'The general manager is the key implementer of the business strategy for the property  and  the  behavioral  role  model  for the entire management team' (Eder and Umbreit, 1989, 333). It can thus be argued that the GM is the central management figure in the hotel  business. The  demands  and  challenges of managing hotels are reflected in the complexities of the GM's job.\n\nThis article takes a close look at the context  in  which  GMs of major hotels work and how this context affects the nature of their job. It is based on the research of one of the authors (Nebel, 1991) into the managerial effectiveness of hotel GMs.The purpose of the research was, in part, to better understand the nature of the GM's job, and through this understanding develop a conceptual framework of it. As Dann (1990) has stated,'[T]here is now a need to . . . develop a conceptual framework for the better understanding of the actual nature of managerial work in the hospitality industry.'\n\nTen extremely successful GMs of some of America's finest hotels agreed to participate in the study. Each of the GMs studied was an experienced, top-rated  hotel  executive  with an average of ten years' experience in the position. One research goal was to study hotels that exhibited the fullest range of operational\n\nand managerial complexity.Thus, the smallest participating  hotel  was  an  internationally renowned  luxury  property  of  about  400 rooms, and the largest was a great convention hotel  of  nearly  2,000  rooms. The  author stayed as a guest at each hotel, observed each GM for three days as he proceeded through his  normal  workday, and  recorded  his  every activity. The  research  methodology  followed closely that employed by Kotter (1982). It employed a combination of participant observation  of  GMs  at  work, extensive  personal interviews with both the GMs and 53 of their key division  heads, background  surveys, and analysis of organizational and operational information from each hotel. The personal interviews extended over a number of days and took  between  four  and  six  hours  with  each GM,and about one hour with each of their division heads. In addition, informal interviews were conducted with at least 100 other executives  and  employees  of  the  ten  hotels. The field research was conducted while the author was on sabbatical leave and resulted in over 700 pages of field notes, which were subjected to extensive qualitative data analysis.\n\nFrom this analysis and from an exhaustive review of the literature on managerial work in hotels  (Guerrier, 1987; Guerrier  and  Lockwood, 1991; Koepper, 1988; Ley, 1978; Shortt, 1989; Umbreit, 1986)  there  has  emerged  a view  of  the  hotel  GM's  job  that  is  given  in Figure 3.1, which presents a model of the influences that shape the job. The model incorporates ideas found in the research of Kotter (1982)  and  Mintzberg  (1973). Kotter  (1982, 10-33)  showed  how  job  demands  and  relationship  demands  affect  executive  behavior. Mintzberg (1973, 55-99) described ten separate  work  roles  that  managers  perform. Figure 3.1 reflects how  the hotel context influences the various job functions and man-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Hotel GMs bear direct responsibility for their properties  and  thus, like  operational  managers  in charge of profit centers anywhere, are under tremendous pressure to produce short-run results. They must therefore devote a substantial amount of their time and efforts toward exercising effective operational control.An important functional characteristic of hotels is that many  of  their  day-to-day  business  problems have extremely short lead times.That is to say, most service-centered problems in hotels must\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 3.1 Key Job Demands and Relationship Issues of Hotel GMs\n\nbe solved quickly or not at all. Moreover, major hotels are both organizationally and operationally complex businesses in which numerous, highly diverse activities take place constantly as well as concomitantly.\n\nTo stay on top of this complicated short lead-time business is unquestionably the single most challenging and demanding aspect of the GM's job. To be able to do so effectively and in a proactive manner so as to retain the ability to influence events, GMs must engage in intense verbal communication and interact frequently  with  subordinates. In  discharging these responsibilities, a hotel GM can be said to  be  performing  the  job  function  of  opera-\n\ntional  controller. However, the  heavy  workload of short-run operational demands must not take up all the time of GMs, as they must also  concentrate  on  intermediate-run  and long-run demands and issues as well.\n\n",

These initiatives represent a proactive  response  to  the  operational  demands of the business; they take time to implement and constitute the bulk of intermediate-run  demands  faced  by  a  hotel GM. These intermediate-run demands, then, involve putting into place a hotel's organizational structure, systems, and people who are capable of quick and effective response to external  stimuli  and  who  can  simultaneously help the hotel meet its demanding daily operational commitments. Thus, in effect, the GM is fine-tuning the hotel's service strategy and refining and realigning its operating systems to ensure a smoothly functioning business.\n\nAll  these  efforts  require  intense, downward internal communication and a high degree  of  interaction  with  subordinates. In addition, intermediate-run  job  demands  require  the  GM  to  develop  communication channels and to nurture relationships that extend beyond the specific domain of the hotel. These relationships include, first, a wide-ranging network of hospitality industry and community contacts who can help the GM better understand the hotel's external environment; and,second,the GM's corporate superiors and staff specialists, whose cooperation is needed for the successful implementation of the formulated  specific  plans  and  programs  for  the hotel. In carrying out these responsibilities, the job function of a hotel GM can be referred to as that of organizational developer.\n\n",

Organizational  stability  and  vitality also gives the hotel the maturity and experience required for it to rethink its basic marketing and service strategies in the event of altered market or environmental conditions.

Because  the  activities  of  a  hotel  are  both numerous  and  diverse, GMs  must  be  constantly monitoring and disseminating detailed information  pertaining  to  daily  operational matters. Time  and  again  throughout  the course of the working day, GMs interact with subordinates to stay on top of the numerous operational  problems  that  occur. GMs  must also  be  available  to  effectively  and  quickly handle disturbances that are not covered by a  hotel's  routine  procedures  or  those  that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsubordinates perceive as being beyond their scope of authority or experience. In order to effectively play this managerial work role of disturbance  handler, GMs  must  have  rapid access to reliable internal information and, in turn, be able to quickly process and disseminate this information downward in the organization. While  functioning  as  operational controller, the GM's work role as resource allocator revolves mostly around the allocation of his or her own time to the numerous shortrun demands of the job. GMs can, of course, allocate a proportion of their hotel's financial and human resources to help solve short-run operational problems, but it is the manner in which they allocate their own scarce time that is of paramount importance when referring to the short-run operational problems of the job.\n\nGMs perform the leader role in every contact with subordinates. Every action of a GM is  analyzed  and  interpreted  by  subordinates; thus, every interaction with subordinates provides  GMs  with  an  opportunity  to  exercise leadership (Hales and Nightingale, 1986).That is why outstanding GMs realize they are constantly in the limelight throughout the working  day. GMs  also  exercise  leadership  by deciding  the  operational  issues  on  which  to concentrate. Subordinates automatically look for  clues  regarding  what  GMs  deem  important; thus, by deciding which operational issues to  focus  on, GMs  send  an  unequivocal  message downward in the organization regarding what they consider important.\n\n",

Further, the information  GMs  gather  from  the  external environment must be analyzed and disseminated to subordinates within the hotel. GMs must  process  both  externally  and  internally obtained  information  in  order  to  effectively play  the  work  role  of  entrepreneur, the  importance of which has been stressed by Ley (1978). As entrepreneurs, GMs are the developers of specific plans and programs geared to  improving  the  operating  efficiency  and service strategy of the hotel. Any new plan or program imposes additional time obligations on  both  the  GM  and  on  subordinates. New plans and programs often involve the allocation of financial and human resources as well.

In  seeking  capital  and planning a strategy for organizational stability and vitality, the GM's work roles of liaison, monitor, and disseminator of external and internal information upward to corporate executives  or  owners  are  critical, as  is  the  work role of allocator of scarce financial resources. The resource allocator role, more often than not, requires detailed presentation of formal budget  proposals  that  include  careful  financial justification. This is especially true if the GM is proposing a major directional shift in the  service  strategy  of  the  hotel. As  maintainer of organizational stability, the GM also plays the work role of disseminator of important  information  downward  to  subordinates. The  GM  must  act  as  entrepreneur  with  respect to important human resource development  plans  and  programs, and, as  with  all activities, continue  as  leader  in  the  ongoing role of nurturing and developing managerial talent.\n\nWhile GMs perform three job functions with  different  time  horizons, it  is  not  necessarily  the  case  that  these  job  functions  are performed independently of each other. That is to say, it is altogether possible for GMs to perform two or even all three job functions simultaneously. It  is  clear  from Table  3.3  that many  of  the  Mintzbergian  managerial  work roles are common to more than one job function. In  fact, the  work  roles  of  monitor, disseminator, resource allocator, and leader are common  to  all  three, while  those  of  liaison and entrepreneur are common to two of the job  functions. Thus, when  GMs  are  engaged with short-run operational concerns, they often do so in the context of longer-run considerations.

A  hotel's  context presents  GMs  with  a  series  of  job  demands and relationship issues with which they must deal effectively in order to be successful. As seen, these job demands and relationship issues differ depending on the time frame under  consideration. These  considerations  give rise  to  specific  job  functions  that  GMs  perform through a variety of work roles.\n\nIn the short run, the GM job function was described  as  that  of  operational  controller. Here, GMs are involved with the day-to-day internal operational control of their business, requiring  intense  and  frequent  downward verbal communication within the hotel. They must be adept at the managerial work roles of monitoring and disseminating a wide variety of internal information, handling nonroutine disturbances, and allocating their own scarce time to important operational issues.\n\nIn the intermediate run, the GM job function  was  described  as  that  of  organizational developer. Here, GMs face the challenges of developing subordinates, formulating specific plans and programs to improve their operational control of the hotel, and fine-tuning the hotel's  service  strategy  in  the  context  of  external  environmental  conditions. In  addition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto  internal  downward  communication, these challenges  require  intense  lateral  communication with both the hotel industry and local community sources. This  helps  the  GM  stay abreast of market and environmental trends. The GM also maintains upward communication  with  corporate  superiors  and  staff  specialists  to  ensure  their  cooperation  in  the successful  implementation  of  operational plans  and  programs. Here, GMs'  work  roles require them to monitor and disseminate external as well as internal information, so they act as liaison between the hotel and the outside world.\n\nThey also  may  initiate, as  entrepreneurs would, plans  and  programs  designed  to  improve  the  hotel's  operational  and  organizational  efficiency. This  requires  the  allocation of their own time, as well as the financial and human resources of the hotel, to these plans and programs.\n\nIn  the  long  run, the  GM's  job  function was described as that of business maintainer. Here, GMs must ensure the long-term viability  of  the  hotel  through  capital  expenditure decisions that are consistent with the hotel's strategic  service  vision, and  by  developing  a degree of organizational stability that allows the  hotel  to  carry  out  its  strategic  plan. Intense  upward  communication  to  corporate superiors, staff specialists, and owners, as well as lateral communication with a wide variety of industry and community contacts, highlight the  relationship  issues  of  this  job  function. GMs are required to play the work role of liaison between the hotel and corporate office or owners as well as industry and community sources. This  involves  monitoring  the  widest variety  of  external  and  internal  information and disseminating it laterally, downward, and upward. In addition, GMs play both the work roles  of  resource  allocator  of  capital  funds\n\nand of entrepreneur when seeing to the organizational  stability  of  the  business. All  three job  functions  require  GMs  to  be  leaders, a work  role  they  play  through  every  contact with subordinates.

Some firms, such as Marriott International  and  Choice  (Enz  and Siguaw, 2000)  have  made  identifying  leadership  competencies  a  priority. Identifying  appropriate competencies helps senior managers in  selecting, developing, and  coaching  future leaders, as well as mapping career paths and planning management succession. In this article we present a leadership-competency model  that  is  industry  specific  and  future based. Our goal in creating this model was to provide  the  hospitality  industry  with  a  functional-competency  model  that: 1)  organizations can use to develop their own model for leadership development, 2) employees can use to understand the competencies they need for advancement, 3) hospitality schools can use to design curriculum, and 4) students can use to craft career paths. We first describe the nature\n\nand use of competency models and then describe our study. We examine the critical competencies that we found to be important (and those that, surprisingly, are not as important). Last, we consider the possible uses for the industry-wide model that we have developed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "A competency model is a descriptive tool that identifies  the  knowledge, skills, abilities, and behavior needed to perform effectively in an organization  (Lucia  and  Lepsinger, 1999). Designed  to  help  an  organization  meet  its strategic objectives through building humanresources  capability, competency  modeling has been in existence since the 1970s, starting with  the  first  models  created  by  David  McClelland (Mirabile, 1997, 73-77). Such models gained  popularity  in  the  late  1980s  and  remain in use today.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompetency  models  focus  on  behavior rather than on personality traits, because personality traits are usually hard to measure accurately  (Lucia  and  Lepsinger, 1999, and ACA's  Competencies  Research  Team, 1996, 6-21). Expressing  desirable  traits  in  behavioral  terms  is  essential  for  a  competency model to be useful as a human-resources tool, because the model must not only define the competencies  necessary  for  effective  performance but also indicate how to tell when a particular competency is being demonstrated. Most  competency  models  express  traits  and characteristics  in  behavioral  terms  on  the grounds that behavior is the observable manifestation of personality traits and characteristics. Competencies  are  deemed  critical  for inclusion in a model when they distinguish superior performers from poor performers.\n\nCompetency models are less specific than is  the  job  analysis  typically  performed  for specific positions, and models can encompass a  whole family of jobs. Choice Hotels International, for example, developed competency models for each of the top four levels of its organization  (i.e., senior  vice  president, vice president, senior director, and director). In so doing, the company found that the competencies for success of a senior vice president were similar  to  those  needed  for  the  other  three positions.\n\n",

The  development  of  a  competency model can help provide guidance for a host of different HR practices and ensure that those\n\npractices  are  consistent. Specifically, competency  models  can  be  used  as  a  foundation from  which  to  establish  criteria  for  a  broad array of HR systems (McLagan, 1996, 60-65 and Lucia and Lepsinger, 1999). For instance, listed below are eight HR activities that can be guided or enhanced with the use of a welldeveloped competency model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompetency  models  confer  several  advantages  on  a  company. First, a  competency model  is  useful  for  building  an  integrated framework for developing a company's human-resources  system. Used  consistently, such  a  model  should  lead  to  improved  and consistent  performance  standards. More  important, the model can be a critical guide during periods of instability and change. Moreover, making HR decisions on the basis of  carefully  developed  competency  models reduces  legal  challenges  to  those  decisions. ( Note: Include  specific  competencies  in  the job description to reduce legal liability, especially if the competencies will be used for performance appraisals.) Finally, well-developed competency  models  enhance  a  company's ability to communicate with its employees regarding the behavior connected with success, thereby increasing the firm's ability to achieve its business objectives (ACA's Competencies Research Team, 1996).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "W ith point number eight in mind, we sought to devise a future-oriented leadership-competency model for the lodging industry. We consider this endeavor to be important given the absence  of  an  industry-focused  model  that works  across  many  organizations. (Our  research found no current models for hospitality leadership.)  Having  an  industry-wide model is important because it can inform stu-\n\ndents and employees alike about the expectations  for  future  leaders  as  identified  by senior-level managers. Furthermore, an industry-wide model helps to paint a comprehensive picture of the critical skills needed by the  entire  industry, thereby  assisting  senior managers  in  hotel  organizations  as  they  devise  and  implement  their  recruitment, selection, and development systems.\n\nLooking ahead. We focused our competency model on managerial behavior that industry executives anticipated would be needed  ten  years  from  now. We  wanted  a model that could be used as a prototype to\n\nTable 3.4 Self-Management: Dimensions of a Competency Factor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nguide  people's  aspirations  in  the  coming years  and  to  create  future  leaders. Asking leaders  to  focus  on  the  future  is  a  common approach when building competency models, although the resulting model may not identify  all  necessary  competencies  (given  that one cannot see the future). ( Note: Firms including  PDI, DDI, and  Hay  Management employ forecasting techniques. We used the linkage  systems  method, asking  participants to  forecast  future  important  behaviors; see Linkage, 1997.)  The  essential  limitation  in asking current leaders to project future competencies is that they may be unable or unwilling  to  define  the  future  differently  from the present. However, many thoughtful executives are able to envision and plan for a future  that  is  not  simply  a  reflection  of  the present, highlighting  behavior  that  they  see as increasingly important.\n\nUsing a  number of  different  competency studies (Mirabile, 1985; Evarts, 1988; Zingheim, Ledford, and Shuster, 1996; Blancero, Boroski, and  Dyer, 1996)  as  a  starting  point, we  constructed a provisional behavioral-competency model  that  captured  the  most  important  dimensions  of  leaders'  behavior  across  several industries. Using this preliminary model, we refined  the  components  through  hospitality managers'  feedback, developing  the  competency  model  by  means  of  the  customized generic  model  method  (Dubois, 1993). We collected  managers'  comments  by  surveying individuals from around the globe who participated in senior-level executive-education programs  at  Cornell  University. In  our  pilot survey, respondents  could  add  other  competencies  that  they  felt  were  becoming  increasingly important and eliminate those items that they deemed inappropriate.\n\nBased  on  the  feedback  from  the  pilot\n\nstudy, we modified the competency model to reflect  hospitality-specific  behavior. In  this fashion, we  arrived  at  a  final  competency model consisting of 8 overarching factors, 28 dimensions, and  99  specific  behavioral  competencies. The  factors  and  dimensions  were derived  from  the  literature  on  competency models  and  through  hospitality  managers' feedback. The  eight  overarching  factors  are communication, critical  thinking, implementation, industry  knowledge, interpersonal skills, leadership, self-management, and strategic  positioning. Each  of  those  factors comprised up to six dimensions that captured various aspects of that factor. Leadership, for example, is composed of the following six dimensions: developing others, embracing change, fortitude, fostering  motivation, leadership  versatility, and  teamwork  orientation. As another example, Table 3.4 shows the behavioral  items  and  dimensions  for  the  selfmanagement factor.\n\nWe listed the 99 hospitality competencies (Table 3.5) in a survey that was faxed worldwide to 735 senior-level industry executives at various  hotel  companies. Using  a  five-point Likert-type  scale  ranging  from  1  (not  at  all important)  to  5  (extremely  important), respondents were asked to rate the importance of each of the 99 competencies or skills for a senior-level manager ten years from now (see the accompanying list).A total of 137 industry leaders responded either online or via return fax, yielding a response rate of 18.6 percent. Participants'  positions  ranged  from  director to CEO or chair of international hotel chains and corporations. Response  rates  for  executive-level employees are notoriously low, and our response rate for this sample was typical for this population (Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld, 1999).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "C ompetency in self-management is the overarching factor that was rated highest by our respondents, followed by knowledge of strategic  positioning, implementation  skill, and  critical  thinking. (Table  3.6  summarizes the  ratings.)  The  self-management  factor achieved a mean importance score of 4.32 out of 5. This factor consists of four behavioral dimensions, namely: (1)  ethics  and  integrity, (2)  time  management, (3)  flexibility  and adaptability, and (4) self-development. Looking at the behavioral dimensions within each competency factor, we found that the behavior of acting ethically or with integrity was the most important to the responding senior leaders. Post-hoc Scheffe tests from an analysis of variance revealed that this behavioral dimension  of  self-management  was  rated  significantly higher than the other three dimensions. The  ethics-integrity  dimension  contains  six specific  behavioral  competencies, such  as 'Treats people with respect,' 'Displays consistency  between  words  and  actions,' and 'Considers ethical implications prior to taking action' (see Table 3.4). The overriding importance of ethical behavior is consistent with previous competency models devised by managers outside the lodging industry. (See competency research reports by consulting firms such  as  Personnel  Decisions  International (www.personaldecisions.com) and Center for Creative Leadership  (www.ccl.org).)  The other  specific  competencies  that  fall  under the self-management factor are 'Works constructively under stress and pressure,' 'Seeks feedback from others,' and 'Spends time on the  most  important  issues, not  just  the  most\n\nurgent.' Overall, self-management  skills  encompass actions related to the personal characteristics  of  the  leader  and  how  she  or  he handles himself or herself.\n\nCompetency in strategic positioning was the overarching factor considered to be second  in  importance  for  future  leaders. This factor  comprises  the  following  four  dimensions: (1)  awareness  of  customer  needs, (2) commitment to quality, (3) managing stakeholders, and (4) concern for community. Examples  of  behaviors  that  fall  under  these dimensions  include  'Influences  and  shapes owners'  and  stakeholders'  decisions,' 'Promotes  quality  initiatives,' and  'Considers customer needs when making decisions.'This factor clearly captures the hospitality industry's service orientation.The senior managers whom  we  surveyed  suggested  that  future lodging-industry  leaders  need  to  be  vigilant in their commitment to both quality and the needs of a variety of different stakeholders, including owners,Wall Street, employees, and customers.\n\nImplementation, critical thinking, and communication skills were also deemed 'extremely  important' by senior managers. Leaders  of  the  future  will  need  to  possess a strategic orientation and  approach  to decision-making  that  permits  them  to  both plan and redesign their organizations. In addition, communicating  persuasively, listening, and enabling others will be essential skills for managers  hoping  to  reach  senior  leadership positions.\n\nIndustry  knowledge, leadership, and  interpersonal skill were factors that, while important, were ranked lower than the others by our respondents. The relatively low score for industry knowledge seems to suggest that the importance  for  leaders  of  industry-specific\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 3.6 Leadership Competency Model for the Lodging Industry\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpertise is decreasing as time goes on. One reason for this is that industry expertise can be acquired by an adept leader, while the capacity for flexibility in a changing business environment can be hard to learn and often is inherent  in  an  individual's  personality  and skill  set. Interpersonal  and  leadership  skills also scored lower than did other factors. We found  it  particularly  interesting  that  the  dimensions of developing others, embracing diversity and change, and leadership versatility were  viewed  as  some  of  the  least  essential skills for the future.\n\nConcern  for  community  was  a  particularly  low-rated  dimension  of  strategic  positioning. Scheffe post-hoc tests  revealed  that this  dimension  was  rated  significantly  lower than the other three strategic-positioning dimensions.Although this dimension is not typically included in competency-modeling research, we  (incorrectly)  thought  that  it might be important to hospitality leaders because of their extensive connections with local community  events  and  activities. This dimension consisted of three items:'Commits organizational resources for community events,''Considers the impact of decisions on community well-being,' and 'Builds partnerships and alliances with community organizations.' Contrary  to  our  thinking, the  results revealed  that  those  three  were  among  the lowest-rated of all 99 items presented on the survey. When compared to other activities, a concern  for  and  relationship  with  the  local community  in  which  the  company  operates does  not  seem  to  be  a  core  competency needed for future hospitality leaders. On the other  hand, competencies  that  appear  to  be the likely core attributes of future leaders are ethics, awareness  of  customer  needs, time management, speaking with impact, commitment to quality, and team orientation.\n\n",

They can also help in educating future generations of leaders by guiding university  faculties  in  designing  curricula  to meet the industry's future needs. An increasing number of university programs are focusing  on  competency  building  in  an  effort  to prepare  students  for  a  specific  industry  (see Journal of Management Education 25(2)). For example, the master of management in hospitality  (MMH) program at Cornell University assesses  entering  students  against  three  core competencies  that  are  deemed  necessary  for graduation. These  competencies  are  leadership skills, teamwork and group-process skills, and  written  and  oral  communication  skills. Students are evaluated through an assessment center  as  they  enter  the  MMH  program  and are  given  feedback  at  the  end  of  the  assessment center, as well as after each subsequent semester.If they have weaknesses in any of the three  competencies, the  students  must  make plans to improve their skills. Students' competency  development  is  further  supported  by special modules offered by faculty members to enhance key skill areas.These modules contain both lecture and experiential components.\n\nIndustry-specific competency models can also help students seek out employment and career  tracks  that  will  give  them  ample  opportunity to develop needed skills.The model presented  here  provides  a  comprehensive framework to inform future managers about what will be needed or expected to lead future lodging firms.A good competency model serves as both a roadmap and a prototype for achieving success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees in lodging organizations may find this model useful as a general guide for self-development. In the absence of an institutional program to help develop a promising manager, a competency model can be used by an  individual  to  design  and  plan  her  or  his own career choices.\n\nLast, individual lodging organizations can use  this  industry-wide  model  to  build  their own specific model. Once an organization has tailored  the  model  to  its  specific  needs, that firm can use the model in a variety of ways. For example, Choice  Hotels  International  now uses its  competency database to perform annual readiness assessments to determine managers' leadership capability. The competencies in  Choice's model are the basis for the company's  selection, promotion, and  succession\n\nplanning. Marriott  employs  a  system-wide leadership-development  initiative, called  the Benchstrength Management System, which is used by current senior managers to build leadership capacity. Using the tools and measurements  from  this  system, Marriott's  senior managers  are  responsible  for  identifying  potential leaders and ensuring that those individuals  develop  the  skills  and  competencies needed  to  carry  the  company  forward. Targeted development plans are created to assist senior managers in filling critical positions that are  'stretch' assignments  for  high-potential managers. The  Benchstrength  Management System provides Marriott with a consistent approach  to  evaluating  its  leadership  potential and ensures that the company focuses on core capabilities that are key to future success.\n\n",

With  Hilton  Hotel  Corporation's  advanced technology, we have the capability of ascertaining  which  guests  are  new  to  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmy professional values were and never doubting that I would always remain true to them. As the years passed, the titles got fancier and the paychecks got bigger. I found myself separating from my beliefs. After losing a job a few  years  ago  (I  didn't  truly  lose  it; I  know where  it  is, but  someone  else  now  has  it), I came to the realization that my paycheck was like a drug. I was thinking in terms of what I could do to get more of it. I had lost sight of how fun and exciting our industry is. Don't be afraid of the zigzagging career path. I found that it often leads where you never planned to go  and  teaches  you  what  you  could  have never planned to learn.\n\nAnd that's as I see it: what I do.\n\nhotel, which  are  returning  guests  and  how many times  they  have  been  here, which  are new to any Hilton brand, and which have experienced problems in the past.We also know if guests have special preferences or requests. Our focus is to exceed guest expectations and increase customer loyalty.\n\nDuring this morning briefing, we also discuss  our  banquet  events, arriving  VIPs, and any  and  all  comment  cards  from  the  night prior. It is a great way to jump-start the morning. The team members briefly describe their day and are sent off with their marching orders. I do enjoy helping every team member be their best.\n\nBy this time, my email box is reaching capacity. What  did  we  ever  do  before  email, I wonder? I attempt to sift through and prioritize the messages.\n\nThe majority of my day is spent at various times  strategizing  and  communicating  with our director of sales and marketing and director of revenue management. Revenue is our lifeblood and of course cures most woes!\n\nBetween meetings with department or division heads, I can expect numerous interruptions coming from any direction. The director of finance requests assistance in reviewing a report that must be submitted quickly to our ownership group. The director of human resources needs to brief me on a new hire or recalcitrant  team  member. The  executive  chef and director of catering would like to review the  banquet  event  order  for  the  upcoming Mayor's State of the City luncheon.\n\nI usually have lunch with clients, local dignitaries, guests, or of course team members in our four-star team dining room! Increasingly, the job of general manager has an outward focus, projecting the image of the hotel to the surrounding community.\n\nAfter  lunch, it is time  to  check  more\n\nemails  and  to  catch  up  on  daily  correspondence. Typically, I've  got  a  corporate  report due  and  phone  calls  to  make  and  return. I spend a great deal of the afternoon reviewing forecasts and working on and updating action plans.\n\nRunning  a  large  hotel  is  essentially  the same as being the CEO of a small company. It is  essential  to  have  a  strong  executive  committee so each department can run independently. This  is  the  key  to  success. Success breeds success.\n\nFunny things happen every day. One day during a staff meeting attended by corporate vice  presidents, I  was  interrupted  by  our  director of safety and security. The safety of our team  members  and  guests  was  in  jeopardy. The  authorities  had  arrived  at  the  hotel  regarding a guest involved with drug trafficking. When the authorities attempted to apprehend the guest, he ran through the hotel waving a weapon. I arrived at the front entrance of the hotel  to  witness  the  guest  face  down  on  the ground  being  handcuffed  while  the  authorities surrounded him with their guns drawn. I didn't want the VPs to be alarmed and leave the meeting room. Before I knew it, the guest had been arrested and business was back to usual. As  I  was  returning  to  my  meeting, a guest  approached me and asked if someone was filming a movie. I responded, 'Welcome to  the  media  capital  of  the  world!  I'm  glad you enjoyed the show.' There are days I feel like  the  ringmaster  of  a  three-ring  circus. I think  this  is  what  keeps  each  day  fresh  and exciting.\n\nI  often  giggle  at  the  old  hotel  industry phrase, 'If  it  weren't  for  those  darn  guests and team members, my day would be much more productive!' However, if it weren't for them, this  job  would  not  be  different  every day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "Bob Peckenpaugh\n\nYou've made it! It is officially your turn. This is  what you have worked for your entire career, the  golden  carrot, the  title  of  general manager. So what is so different?\n\nNo matter what position(s) prepared you for this goal, it is all yours now. Total responsibility  for  the  profit  and  loss  statement  and the success of the entire operation is in your hands. This  is  your  opportunity  to  lead  the senior management team in achieving the desires of the ownership, the management company, or  both. You  are  now  setting  the  tone for the operation and providing the results to the next level up.\n\nResults are what your game plan is built around. Whether  you  work  for  an  independent  or  a  corporation, someone  is  going  to want answers. What do they expect? Is it all about bottom-line profits, five-star services, or a  happy  medium? What elements of performance are most important to the company? Ask these questions and you are well on your way to developing your goals, the outline for your future success.\n\nSet your goals, document them, and begin measuring  your  results. Obvious  categories are  guest  and  employee  satisfaction, great communications, and  positive  financial  results. Remember, you  are  now  the  general manager with a supporting cast of managers who each love specific talents and knowledge. Utilize  these  skills  by  communicating  your goals and ask your team to outline their goals to support what you have set forth.\n\nSounds simple right? Here is where your day begins. You are now leading those who\n\nwere  your  peers  yesterday. How  are  you going  to  set  the  tone  for  your  team  and create an atmosphere that will support your expectations?\n\nCreate the image. A mission statement is a good starting point. What were the expectations  given  to  you?  How  do  you  want  the team  to  function? At  the  Rancho  Bernardo Inn, we  developed  the  following  mission statement: 'To  be  the  finest  family-owned destination  resort, exemplifying  comfortable elegance  and  service  of  unmatched  warmth and  sincerity. We  will  treat  all  of  our  guests and  each  other  as  lifetime  friends. The  way the world is supposed to be.' The mood is set, the expectation is laid out, and we are all going to be friends in a world that's the way we want it to be, the one we are creating.\n\nGive direction. How are you going to support the mission statement? Get the team involved; you will be amazed at how easy this is. We  have  developed  a  set  of  core  values  to show how we want to operate and what our roadmap looks like:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSet  the  stage. Now  focus  on  the  experience. How  will  you  conduct  yourself  with your staff, and how do you expect your staff to treat the guests? Each time you come on duty, you are stepping on stage. Describe the performance everyone is expected to give.We do this through a set of service expectations:\n\nRemember,the team needs direction, and they need it daily; you set the tone, and they create the atmosphere you want by following your example. Don't underestimate the value of each team member watching your actions. Treat others as you want to be treated!\n\nNow take your creation on the road. Get the  word  out. It  is  like  a  campaign; infuse  it into  every  communication: general  meetings for all staff members, staff meetings for managers, departmental  meetings  for  more  intimate settings, and  daily  line-up  meetings  for repetition. Make it known what the expectation is and hold everyone equally accountable.\n\nIn a typical day as a general manager you will have contracts to sign, new managers to guide, senior  managers  to  focus, vendors  to negotiate  with, forecasting  to  accomplish, guests to intrigue, and controls to monitor. Interruptions are commonplace. The chief engineer  may  call  you  to  discuss  the  effects  on your guests of the chiller going down. The director of human resources is on the line because a manager just overstepped his bounds with  an  employee. As  you  are  comparing notes from the individuals involved, your cell phone  rings; it's  the  golf  course  superintendent, who  is  on  the  twelfth  hole  in  the  rain watching  the  river  that  runs  through  your property flood the course and the neighbors'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhouses. Now you have to find time to coordinate  the  insurance  adjusters, geologists, and canal  clearing  teams  to  determine  liabilities, flow patterns, and potential problem solving for the future. Now it is lunchtime. Have you kept your head about you? Are you following the philosophies noted above?\n\nGeneral management is about using your brain, not your brawn. As you can see, your day can consume you. Don't let it. Surround yourself with the best talent possible and set the level of expectation high. You can spend the  day  involving  yourself  with  every  detail you can dig up, or you can find and nurture talent that can help free your time.Take pride in helping others learn to handle situations so you have time to focus the direction you have set.\n\nEducate  yourself. Read  trade  journals and newspapers. Keep up with community issues. Seek the latest trends in food and drink. Is your room product better than the competition? Being on the front end of a trend could mean free press for your hotel. Let your passion show through.\n\nGet the word out. Employ a public relations  company  to  ensure  you  get  your  fair share  of  accolades  in  the  places  your  target guests  will  see  them. Use  your  marketing team to research advertising opportunities, direct mail, and Internet options. Make yourself available to the sales team. The general manager's  influence  during  a  decision-maker's site  inspection  can  make  a  profound  difference. Be  available, active, and  involved. The phrase  'Build  it  and  they  will  come' only works in the movies. The team must be ener-\n\ngized to sell. They need to believe in your direction and vision as much as you do.\n\nSpecial  assignments  can  be  rewarding. You may be called on to determine the direction of the development of the property.Your analytical skills may be tested in explaining to the ownership how a new ballroom will make them more money. You may be called on to sell the idea to community planning leaders to ensure  the  permitting  process  is  successful. Your  speaking  skills  may  be  further  challenged in a town hall forum, with tough questions coming directly at you with no time to prepare an answer. You can do it; just translate the skills you learned from guest interactions. Remember your vision.\n\nCommunity  involvement  can  be  vital. Keep up with the economic indicators in your region. Serve  on  a  board  for  the  Hotel  and Lodging Association or the Convention and Visitor  Bureau. You  must  be  involved  with politicians  when  transient  occupancy  taxes are a topic of city fund-raising. Will community  involvement benefit your hotel or company? The current mayoral race may set the tone  for  many  decisions  that  will  affect  the hospitality  business  in  the  next  four  years; your  influence  and  support  for  right  candidate  may  be  needed. The  property  you  run will  develop  a  reputation  that  will  be  your signature. You will be setting a tone throughout  the  community  in  everything  you  do  at your hotel.\n\nRemember that you represent your hotel. Its  ultimate  success  will  be  your  success, so don't  get  too  distracted. Keep  focused  and have fun. You have earned it!\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "The  student  of  hospitality  management  will find the hotel's front office referred to as the hub, the nerve center, the brain, or some other name suggesting centrality. As H. E. Heldenbrand  stated  in  his  classic  1944  book Front Office Psychology, 'To the guest, the manager is largely represented by the front office, and the unseen head will be judged favorably or otherwise by the guest treatment there' (Introduction). The  observations, opinions, and research presented in this section are chosen to illustrate the centrality of the front office in the modern hotel.\n\nA theme that recurs throughout many of the readings in this section is that of communications. In an increasingly communicationsoriented society  and  world, information-its storage, retrieval, dissemination, and evaluation-can mean a competitive edge and, to a certain  extent, power. Technology  has  given\n\nus  the  Internet, cellular  phones, electronic mail  (e-mail), telephone-  and  computertransmitted  facsimiles  (faxes), overnight  delivery  of  letters  and  packages, and  personal data assistants (PDAs). These all combine to generate  an  expectation  of  clear  and  nearly instantaneous communication and, by logical extension, fast and efficient services based on communications. This, in  turn, has  increased the complexity of the hotel's front office and at the same time delivered increased opportunities to serve the hotel's guests. It has, therefore, significantly  changed  the  role  of  the front office and the front office manager from that described by Heldenbrand.\n\nIn  1985, Rutherford  studied  a  national sample  of  front  office  managers  (FOMs) and concluded that communication had emerged as a central issue. FOMs had added to the  predictable  role  of  department  manager\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nresponsibilities  as  facilitator  and  broker  of communication in its various forms among the other hotel departments, the front office, and the hotel guests.The model that emerged from this analysis carries with it the powerful message  that  the  FOM's  job  clearly  revolves around  communications. A  major  conclusion of this study was that hotel firms should consider communication skills an important criterion in considering candidates for the position of FOM.\n\nWhen communication is coupled with the aforementioned complexity and guest expectations  of  instant  availability  of  information and data, it is easy to see why the front office and  its  staff  operate  under  considerable stress. Being  the  hub  or  nerve  center  of  a modern hotel has as one of its positive aspects the fact that front office staff can be keenly aware of what is happening at virtually every level  of  the  hotel's  organizational  structure. One of the negative aspects is that the front office serves as a lightning rod for guest complaints. Dealing with complaints can be one of the  most  difficult  tasks  for  the  front  office staff  to  learn, especially  given  the  frequency and  sometimes  the  intensity  of  guest  complaints and expectations.\n\nSuccessful FOMs ideally possess demonstrated competencies in both oral and written communications to deal with these complexities  and  challenges. The  FOM, therefore, is not  only  a  manager  and  a  communicator among the front office staff, the hotel departments, and the guests but also a communicator  in  yet  another  way-that  of  teacher  and trainer.\n\nThis contextual theme of communications is carried forward in the essay contributed by James Bardi. Bardi discusses the job of FOM, providing  insights  about  the  complexities  of\n\nthe  job  relative  not  only  to  communication but also to elements of an FOM job analysis, intrahotel  relations, and  the  emerging  and popular concept of employee empowerment.\n\nTo  see  how  this  all  fits  together, walk  a few miles in the shoes of FOM Garry Dickover. At the time this was written, Dickover was the FOM of two hotels: Marriott's River Center and Riverwalk Hotels in San Antonio, Texas. Currently  general  manager  of  the Courtyard Convention Center in Las Vegas, Dickover invites you to see the inside of the FOM's job and how he practices the theory of managing the front office.\n\nIn  1993, Glenn Withiam  researched  and wrote  'American  Concierges  Set  Service Standards,' an essay used in the second and third editions of Hotel Management and Operations. Withiam also wrote an earlier piece, 'Keepers of the Keys: Concierges in American Hotels' (1983). The 'keys' references the practice  in  European  hotels  of  hotel  guests leaving  their  room  keys  with  the  concierge upon  leaving  the  floor  of  their  room. The concierge  therefore 'kept  the  keys' for  the guest. The job today has evolved to use keys as a metaphor for the processes of gatekeeping access to hotel and community services on behalf of the guest. Concierges have a professional  society, Les  Clefs  d'Or, which  uses crossed  keys  as  an  identifying  device. The concierges who are members and so certified are said to be keyed.\n\nFor this fourth-edition article on concierges, Dr. Mario Arnaldo of Hawaii Pacific University acknowledges  Withiam's work as the heritage and underpinning of his current  research, which  led  to  this  chapter. Herein, Arnaldo presents an overview of research he did on the post-9/11 American hotel concierge and guest service staff. The strict\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napplication  of  the  title concierge indicates a  hotel  employee  working  at  a  conciergedesignated desk in a hotel property. To accurately assess the contributions of these hotel professionals, Arnaldo  contacted  dozens  of contemporary  concierges  and  guest  service staff  members, who generously provided examples of their concierge experiences.The author  reviews  in  an  accessible, conversational manner  the  following  questions: What's  up with concierges these days? Who does the office  work?  What  are  the  organizational  departments  they  work  in?  What  kind  of interactions do they have with other hotel departments? What is their greatest wish?\n\nThe  theme  of  active  communications  is carried through the piece contributed by Bill Quain and Steve LeBruto. If hotels are going to  actively  find  the  best  pieces  of  business, then  there  must  be  good  communications channels  among  all  the  organizational  components that guide the guest to a purchase decision. Whether  this  is  at  the  front  desk, through the reservations system, or through a travel agent, it is important to recognize the most  attractive  pieces  of  business  and  what potential bookings may be logically refused. Yes, refusing business is a central component of  successful  yield  management, but  not  always. In  their  words: 'Yield  management  is usually  thought  of  in  the  context  of  turning away undesirable business during excess demand periods. However, the real art of yield management is in learning how to turn undesirable booking requests into desirable ones.'\n\nTheir article helps the reader, in an interesting and entertaining way, learn to make these management decisions.\n\nYield and revenue management are also treated in the marketing section of this book with other, in some ways contrasting, views by Chappelle. The reader who wants additional insights into these concepts is directed to the contributions by that author.\n\nThe articles and essays presented here for your consideration represent only a fraction of the potential range of issues attendant on any modern hotel front office. The duties, obligations, and  responsibilities  of  front  office personnel change from hotel company to hotel company based on such variables as market  segmentation, organizational  structure, corporate  philosophy, and  individual  leadership. A  large  amount  of  management  literature  exists  that  is  not  specific  to  the  front office but nonetheless pertains to the various issues and challenges that face FOMs. The articles chosen for inclusion in this section are as specific as possible to functional aspects of front  office  management. Other  pertinent managerial  insights  may  be  applied  from other  contexts  once  the  reader  has  a  good functional grasp of front office activities. Included  in  the  suggested  readings  are  textbooks that treat in great depth the functional and  technical  aspects  of  front  office  operations. What  has  been  attempted  here  is  an overview of pervasive managerial issues typical of those currently facing FOMs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "James A. Bardi\n\nThe exciting atmosphere of a hotel lobby often  intrigues  students  of  hotel  management. People from all walks of life and corners of the world cross paths to discuss and share ideas, greet family and friends on special occasions, attend conferences to debate issues, or discuss business deals. Questions concerning arrivals, meeting  times, rates, food  and  beverage  services, directions, transportation  services, or whereabouts  of  the  management  staff  and guests  create  a  commotion  that  seems  overwhelming at times. Is someone in charge here? The preprofessional who sets as his or her career objective being the general manager of a hotel and hopes the required tenure as a front office  manager  (FOM)  proceeds  with  haste will find the role challenging. If you begin your career  in  hotel  management  as  a  front  desk clerk, bellperson, or  cashier, you  have  a  vast opportunity to explore just who is in charge.\n\nIn a 1985 study, Rutherford discussed the important  dimensions  of  the  FOM's  job, including communications, facilitation, and organizational interface and technical minutia. Selected  job  functions  reported  in  the  research  findings  included  communications with guests and employees; facilitating medical emergencies, selling  up, power  failure procedures, walking guests due to overbooking, and  design  of  computer  systems  for  the front office; and organizational interface with the director of marketing, controller, food and beverage  manager, and  catering  manager. These  job  skills  and  interactions  require  a person  to  prioritize  and  to  resolve  many  issues, to make quick decisions based on sound\n\ncorporate management concepts, to empower employees, and to refine exemplary communication techniques.\n\nBardi (1990, 345-349) stated, '[T]he front office  manager  must  take  an  active  role  in gathering  information  of  interest  to  guests and in developing procedures for the front office  to  use  in  disbursing  this  information.' This information is also needed by various departments to assist in delivering and organizing hospitality.This is a tall order for the FOM to  fulfill, especially  considering  the  total realm of potential information guests may require and from what departments. Those hotel  departmental  areas  and  their  sources  of guest information are included below:\n\n",

This hotel executive must analyze and seek the pieces of information guests will probably need and figure out which departments must interact to fulfill these needs.\n\nFurther inquiry into the role of the FOM can  be  accomplished  by  reviewing  the  elements of a job analysis of this position. Bardi (1990, 49-50)  presents  a  job  analysis  of  an FOM's duties on a typical day.\n\nAlthough this list shows only a few of the many duties performed in any one day in the life of an FOM, it provides the aspiring hospitality professional with an idea of the range of managerial activities. The FOM must stay in control of all activities that affect the delivery of hospitality to the guest-a major function of a hotel's financial success.\n\nIf  delivering  hospitality  to  the  guest  is  a major responsibility of the FOM, what are the components of this subsystem of the hotel operation? How does the front office and, subsequently, the FOM fit in? An answer to this question  can  be  derived  from  reviewing  the guest  service  cycle  in  a  hotel  (adapted  from Albrecht and Zemke, 1985). If the FOM analyzes the various guest-departmental contacts, he  or  she  can  move  toward  understanding how the front office fits into the efficient delivery  of  the  hotel's  hospitality  services. The potential  departmental  contacts  in  the  cycle are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis list of components in a guest service cycle suggests the vast array of duties the FOM\n\nencounters in managing the delivery of hospitality services. However, one piece of 'electrifying  magic' is  still  required  to  make  front office  hospitality  relevant  to  modern  service delivery realities: employee empowerment.\n\nSternberg (1992) discusses the concept of empowerment  as  a  granting  of  authority  to employees to make everyday decisions within guidelines. For example, many guests of a hotel feel they are in the middle of a bureaucracy when they want to have a charge adjusted on their account folio. 'Step aside and I'll call my supervisor' is too  often  the  response  to  a guest's inquiry about a charge adjustment.The cashier  is  only  doing  what  he  or  she  was trained to do. However, the guest doesn't care what  the  training  was; he  just  knows  the system  isn't  user-friendly. As  Sternberg  emphasizes, if guidelines  are  established  and communicated, the cashier should know what to do. Here is the manager's chance to provide that first electrifying jolt of empowerment.\n\nCharges within a specified dollar amount that are debated can be credited or adjusted without  the  supervisor's  approval. A  corresponding control system can be implemented that  will  reveal  the  extent  of  the  credit granted per cashier.\n\nAnother example of providing empowerment  opportunities  for  front  office  staff  is provided by Allin and Halpine (1988) in describing  quality  assurance  training  at  the Waldorf-Astoria:\n\nWhile there  can  be  many  reasons  to  combine the positions of registration clerk and cashier, and  many  aspects  were  considered  at  the Waldorf-Astoria, the decision was driven by a desire to improve guest service where its impact is most  obvious-at  the  front  desk. Crosstrained  employees  speed  the  check-in  and checkout process by performing both functions, as the traffic at the desk dictates. Registration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nclerks  can  cash  checks  and  cashiers  can  issue duplicate room keys, in many cases eliminating the  necessity  of  having  the  guest  wait  in  two lines.\n\nOther opportunities to provide employee empowerment can be identified through careful analysis by the FOM of the progress of the guest through the guest service cycle.\n\nThe  potential  opportunities  to  serve  or mis-serve the guest can be appreciated when viewed in the context of guests times service contacts. If  12  million  guests  pass  through  a hotel company's entire system in a year and each has an average of 12 contacts with hotel staff-guest service staff, housekeepers, front\n\noffice  clerks, and  others-that's  144  million chances for the chain to give a good or bad impression  (Bardi, 1990, 233). As  the  gatekeeper of many, if not most, of these potential contacts, the FOM is in a unique position to help his or her staff enhance the guest experience. Empowerment is another powerful tool in the FOM's managerial arsenal.\n\nThe role of the FOM demands a mastery of  communication, operational  details, and, increasingly, empowerment. The  challenging and  attractive  nature  of  this  role  allows  the new  hospitality  professional  to  try  various ways  to  apply  interpersonal  skills  that  will yield  a  profit  for  the  hotel. It  is  a  challenge that will last a lifetime.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Garry Dickover\n\nIt's  6:00  on  a  Saturday  morning. The  alarm clock is blaring its normal 'beep, beep, beep, beep.'The sun is peering through the window. Time to start another day as front office manager. It is going to be a busy day featuring 800 arrivals and 750 departures. Plus, the hotel is 50 rooms oversold. It is going to be a fun one.\n\nIt's 7:00 A.M. The drive to work is an easy one  this  Saturday  morning. It gives  me  a chance to think about one thing in particular that is on tap for today. There is a 9:00  A.M. pre-convention meeting for the group that is arriving  today. There  is  the  regular  morning pre-shift meeting. Today I also have to review hospitality standards with the front desk staff. You would think that it would be easy to have\n\npeople smile and greet the guest, use a guest's name, add a value statement about the hotel or city, and thank the guest for his or her business. I don't ask for much, but to train people to do those four things can be a challenge.\n\nPre-shift meetings are an important start to the day, but it can be a hassle getting everyone together. There are a lot of reasons why an  associate  can't  make  a  pre-shift  meeting, but attendance is important to the success of my department. It is the time I have everyone together, let them know what is going on for the day, and get a chance to share with them the standards we have set and how they can apply them to the customer.At 1:00 P.M. today I  have  a  Safety  Committee  meeting, and  at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4:00  I  have  my  weekly  rap  session  with  the telephone  department. Yeah, I  think  to  myself, it is going to be a full day.\n\nAs  I  arrive  to  work, I  can  see  that  the check-outs have already started. It is nice to see the bellmen taking care of our guests.As I scan the grounds, I make sure there is no trash on the ground, the bell carts are clean, and the valet parking staff is hustling to retrieve guest cars. I look at the windows of the entryway to the  hotel  to  check  for  cleanliness. The  front drive is the first and last thing a guest sees, so it  has  to  be  looking  good. Today, all  looks good.\n\nIt is better for me to spot-check the area before  the  general  manager  comes  by  and sees any problems.As the FOM, I learned the GM's  route  when  he  arrives  at  work, so  I make  sure  the  area  is  clean. (This  is  something they did not teach me in college, along with  how  to  repair  printers  and  copy  machines-some  things  you  gotta  learn  by  doing.) This morning, things look good.\n\nIt's 7:50 A.M. I make my way to the back of  the  front  office. My  desk  managers  are busy  getting  information  ready  for  the  preshift meeting.As I walk through the area, I always make it a point to greet people as I pass and wish them a good morning. I know how important it is to give each and every associate a cheerful good morning. It sets the stage for the day.And you know, it really does make people  feel  good. A  good  department  head recognizes  his  or  her  associates. The  first words that come out of your mouth should be pleasant. The  front  office  team  takes  the brunt of all the complaints. They don't need me to harp on them.\n\nThe pre-shift meeting goes smoothly. The desk managers prep the team for the day, I review the hospitality standards, and we are set. As we are about to finish, I notice some ten-\n\nsion on the staff's faces.They know they are in for a tough day-remember, 50 rooms oversold. It is important that I don't let the team see any stress I may feel on my face.The team knows how important it is to sell out the hotel. They  know  that  once  a  room  is  empty overnight, you never get a chance to sell that room again.They also know you have to oversell the hotel. This is the time I can reassure them that the revenue department has calculated  all  of  the  slip  percentages  for  the  big group checking in.A slip percentage is the expected  variation  from  stated  arrival  and rooms pick-up percentages the group's meeting planner promised. It is important for me to develop a good relationship with the revenue department.The FOM must be active in the  forecast  meetings  to  ensure  the  hotel  is not 'sold up the river,' meaning overcommitted by the sales staff.\n\nRelationship building is an important job for the FOM. It is where trust is establishedtrust between you and the other departments. It is not me versus them; it's us trying to maximize revenue and occupancy and to continue to  build  loyalty. This  is  the  time  to  reassure the  team  that  if  we  do  our  jobs  as  we  have been  trained, all  will  be  fine. We  do  a  little cheer, and out to the desk they go! Now for a cup of coffee.\n\nI review the plans with the desk managers for the sold-out night. This is also the time I check  availability  at  other  hotels, check  the stayover  requests  and  no-show  percentages, and check for duplicated reservations. It looks like  they  have  it  under  control. I  doublecheck  the  staffing  during  the  peak  periods and remind the managers to get everyone to lunch. (As  simple  as  this  sounds, sometimes we forget.) I check my watch; 30 minutes to the pre-con. Better pull out the group resume, which is our profile of the group that includes,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\namong many other things, a historical profile of  the  group's  room  pick-ups, occupancies, and food and beverage revenues.\n\nAt 8:45 A.M., I'm off to the pre-con. I head by the desk to wave to the staff, and I stop by the  telephone  system, bellstand, and  the concierge desk. All seems to be going smoothly.At the pre-con, we all do our formal introductions and meet the group's representatives, usually the meeting planner and members  of  the  group's  leadership. We  each discuss  our  individual  departments  and  the relationship we will have with the group. This is our time to sell them on how well we will do for their group. It is a successful pre-con; all the parties seem happy. I spend just a couple of  minutes  with  the  group  convention  manager, giving an update on the oversold situation. If we have to walk guests, it is important to  let  the  group  convention  manager  know about the situation.Today I said we might, but we should be in good shape. She thanks me for the update.\n\nAs I make my way back to the front office, I end up walking with the resident manager (RM). He asks me how things went last night and how our hotel is for tonight. As an FOM, it is important to know what your boss is  going  to  ask  you. Bosses  are  all  different, but they always seem to ask the same questions. It is important to review the daily sales and occupancy report from the previous day so you know what is going on and can share this information with the RM. I gave the RM the information he wants, always emphasizing the positives.\n\nWhen I  get  back  to  my  office, I  have  a couple  of  associates  wanting  to  talk  to  me. They are bothered by the new schedule. They wanted some specific days off and, because of the business, they did not get them. This is a delicate situation. You want to be fair to the\n\nteam, but you also have to respect why your managers did what they did.The best thing to do is to listen to what your associates say and then review the situation. I have found that 80 percent  of  the  time  there  is  an  alternative. You  want  to  create  win-win  solutions. By spending  time  with  your  associates, you demonstrate to them you care about their situation; this helps build loyalty. Remember that they don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Another situation solved.\n\nThe next couple of hours I spend reviewing the previous day's information and getting caught up on email, memos, and other communications. Generally, this is the time I get a couple of phone calls from upset guests. This could  be  for  a  variety  of  reasons. Before check-out, some people always want to let the manager know how things went. It is important  to  listen  to  customers  when  they  complain. It is a  great  way  to  find  out  what deficiencies you may have in the hotel's service processes. Most complaints are caused by a breakdown in the process. Sometimes people get upset over the smallest things. Sometimes  they  have  a  right  to  be  upset. One example from past experience was the room being so cold that  when the guest lifted  the toilet seat, the water had a small sheet of ice on it. Ensuring customer satisfaction is a large part of the FOM's job. You have to own hospitality. Your team sets the stage for a guest's entire stay. It better be good!\n\nBy now it is 12:15 P.M. and time for lunch. I grab the information I need for the 1:00 P.M. safety meeting. I will go directly to that meeting after lunch. As I make my way, I check on the  desk  and  the  house  count. We  are  now only 29 oversold. We have had some canceled reservations, and we also had 18 early departures. Things are looking good.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt 1:00 P.M. I walk into the safety meeting. This is never an exciting meeting, but it is always important. Accidents are costly to the hotel. It is important to keep accident prevention a priority for all associates. Today we talk about  the  most  current  accidents, how  they could  have  been  prevented, and  the  next steps. We  also  discuss  the  implications  of safety  and  security  interests  for  our  guests. This is  important to avoid lawsuits and provide  guests  with  a  safe  and  secure  environment. The meeting wraps up at 2:30 P.M.\n\nAs I come down the escalator, I see the check-ins are starting to arrive. I head to the bellstand  to  see  if  the  bell  captain  is  caught up. All is well. Because lines are forming, I go behind the front desk to handle a few checkins. I  always  like  this  part  of  the  job. It  also gets a smile from the desk clerks. Before you know it, you have helped move the line. Because the desk is staying busy, it is time for me to move out and manage from the lobby. This is  a  great  way  to  watch  what  is  happening. You can view your whole front office team by being in the lobby. (You can also ensure the cleanliness of the area. This helps our friends in housekeeping.) A big part of the job in the lobby is just  answering questions and giving directions. Every  guest  I  help  means  one guest who did not have to go to the front desk and one more guest who did not have to stand in line. This is the fun part of the job!\n\nAt 3:50 P.M., my pager goes off. It is a reminder about my 4:00 P.M. rap sessions. I can't believe 90 minutes passed while I was in the lobby. It is a good day.\n\nMeeting with associates allows me to take the  pulse  of  their  work  situation. I  do  it  in small groups or as a one-on-one rap. It helps build a relationship within the team and also helps identify challenges I was unaware of. I ask leading questions so the session does not\n\nbecome a bitch session; this helps me control the meeting. During this meeting, I discover some equipment that is needed and that we need more uniforms for the team. It would be great to buy them all new uniforms, but I have to  stay  within  my  budget. Sometimes that is hard  to  do. I  take  notes  on  their  comments and will pass them on to the other managers. It is important for all of the managers to be in the loop. I always keep the raps to about an hour.\n\nBy now it is 5:00 P.M., our peak check-in time. I  go  back  out  to  the  lobby  to  see  how things are going. On a busy day like today, I typically spend the next couple of hours helping  out  in  the  lobby. At  5:30  P.M., the  night manager on duty (MOD) comes out to meet with me. We usually work the lobby together while  I  tell  him  about  the  day. He  tells  me about the previous night. Of course, the first thing  he  shows  me  is  the  house  count: 24 rooms oversold and 352 arrivals expected.We are in good shape. It is important to track the number  of  no-shows. This  helps  you  make better  decisions  to  maximize  your  revenue. The MOD is a little nervous. I tell him not to worry, we will be fine. We review the sold-out night so we don't miss anything. He tells me he  already  has  the  walk  letters  (expressing our  regret  and  outlining  our  promises  to  a guest who is walked to another hotel) out on the desk. This brings a good laugh. We have done this plenty of times, so I trust that the hotel is in good hands.\n\nIt's  7:00  P.M., and  things  seem  to  be  in good  shape. Time  to  go  home. I  make  one more trip  around  to  the  departments  in  the front  office  to  see  how  they  are  doing  and wish them a good evening.Another good day!\n\nThe day described above is a typical day as a front office manager. Some days have different meetings, some days have more upset\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nguests, some days have more upset associates, and some days are just better than others are. The thing I have learned over the years is that the job of the FOM is the same. Take care of\n\nthe associates, who take care of the customers, who take care of the business. It's  the  same job, just different players, and I love it.\n\n",

      "content": "Y ield management, as a term, is not very exciting. However, the results of a well-run yield management program are certainly exciting! Properly implemented, it means that a business can make more money. The keys are to sell more and to sell more profitable items.\n\nThe first step in a yield management program  is  to  determine  who  is  the  best  customer. The best customer is the one who can spend the most money at your property purchasing  profitable  items. The  products  and services you provide are the best fit for their needs. The  best  customers  for  the  property are the ones who receive the greatest benefit from  your  services. They  are  willing  to  pay more, buy more frequently, and remain more loyal because you are satisfying their needs.\n\nMany  operations  do  not  know  who  the best customers are. However, the answer is in a property's data collection system. Guest histories, food and beverage checks, cash register receipts, and the records of strategically allied business  partners  contain  most  of  the  information any property needs to determine the ideal customer base. In order to properly implement  a  yield  management  project, the property  must  be  viewed  as  a  collection  of\n\nprofit centers. A profit center is a place where value is created and exchanged.\n\nOne of the  techniques  of  yield  management is to let the guest in on the secrets of the establishment. Give him or her all the information  necessary  to  truly  enjoy  the  experience. As part of the yield management plan, management must be willing to make experts of the guests by sharing information on how they can utilize all of the profit centers.\n\nAn important  part  of  analyzing  the  potential of each profit center is to identify all the possible sources of revenue. This means analyzing  both  the  revenue-producing  outlets  and  the  people  who  spend  the  money. Every  establishment  has  a  wide  variety  of revenue outlets.They can range from the sale of rooms to valet service, flower delivery, specialty  drinks, cigars, and  creative  take-out services.\n\nStrategic  alliances  with  car  rental  agencies, cooperative  advertising, couponing, and packaging  of  all  sorts  will  vastly  change  the number  of  channels  the  guest  can  use  to spend  money  in  the  profit  centers  of  the enterprise.\n\nRestaurants  can  increase  revenues  by serving take-out food, catering private parties off-premises, adjusting  the  menu  mix, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndeveloping reward systems for servers. Especially  during  hours  of  peak  demand, restaurants  can  design  product/price  combinations that  offer  incentives  to  customers  to  change their demand patterns. Why accept any reservation  at  any  time?  Instead, select  the  most profitable reservations and use incentives to move the other reservations to non-peak or shoulder times.\n\nProfits are the only true measure of business success. The following groups all benefit from enhanced profits:\n\nManagers face six major obstacles in their efforts to implement a yield management system. These impediments are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

The three concepts are simplifying the yield management system to make it manageable; examining the rate controls to make certain they  allow  acceptance  of  the  business  that yields the strongest revenue return; and using length-of-stay controls to shift demand from sold-out periods to slack periods.\n\nGroup business, as it relates to the above three  points, is  a  special  case. The  change needed, if  any, is  to  think  in  terms  of  which business  is  best  for  the  property  on  a  given date.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "O ne may think of yield management as a relatively recent practice, but the lodging industry  has  applied yield management principles for  many  years. In  one  early  instance, Marriott Corporation  used  yield  management principles  long  before  it  installed  its  current sophisticated system. Back when young J. W. 'Bill' Marriott  was  working  at  the  family's first  hotel, the Twin  Bridges  in Washington, D.C., the property sold rooms from a drive-up window. As  Bill  tells  the  story, the  property had  a  flat  single  rate  and  charged  extra  for each  additional  person  staying  in  the  room.\n\nWhen  availability  got  tight  on  some  nights, Bill  recalls  leaning  out  the  drive-up  window to  assess  the  cars  waiting  in  line. If  some  of the  cars  were  filled  with  passengers, Bill would turn away the vehicles with just a single  passenger  to  sell  his  last  rooms  to  fuller cars. That  technique  demonstrates  the  core concept of yield management.\n\nFrom that simple start, yield management mechanisms  have  become  complicated-so complicated  that  some  managers  whom  we have met seem to think they cannot improve revenue unless they have access to the most sophisticated tools. Worse, the hotel manager may have created an overly complex system of  discounts  and  packages. If  the  manager then insists on managing every rate or package individually, the result is a sense that the property has too many programs to track and control, and it probably does. For this reason, the first suggestion for a straightforward approach to yield management is to cluster rates into a few groupings of similar programs and then work on controlling these clusters or rate categories.\n\nThe goal of yield management is to select which business to accept and which business to turn away (when demand exceeds supply), based on the relative value of each booking. Most properties do not need more than four to  six  rate  buckets  for  their  transient  bookings. As an example, the following gives transient  rate  categories  that  combine  programs of similar value:\n\nLevel 1 Rack (no discount)\n\nLevel 2\n\n10 to 20 percent discount\n\nLevel 3\n\n25 to 35 percent discount\n\nLevel 4 40 to 50 percent discount\n\nLevel 5\n\ngreater than a 50 percent discount\n\nEach level or bucket in the above hypothetical  structure  might  comprise  several\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nroom rates. Given such a structure, a manager need  not  agonize  over  whether  to  restrict rooms offered at a rate  of  $150  in  hopes  of getting  a  rate  of  $155. While  it  is  given  that those $5 bills would pile up, the complexity is not  worth  it, especially  when  one  might  be working so hard on the $5 difference that one overlooks  the  opportunity  to  earn, say, $50 more by selling at rack rate.\n\nIf  a  given  set  of  discounts  isn't  working, the hotel should change the categories. For instance, if  a  hotel's  business  fell  entirely  in Level 1 and Level 2, with virtually no business in  Level  3, a  manager  should  rearrange  the rate buckets. The three rate buckets could be discounts from rack rate of 10 to 15 percent, 20  to  40  percent, and  greater  than  40  percent-or any other arrangement that makes a meaningful division among rate categories.\n\nThe following principles apply to setting up categories to manage rates at a hotel:\n\ncategories to no more than six or so, particularly  if  there  is  no  automated  yield management system.The chief reason for that  limit  is  that  yield  management  requires  forecasting  demand  for  each  rate category. Not only is it time-consuming to forecast  numerous  categories  (with  diminishing returns as the number of categories increases), but the more categories are created, the less accurate the forecasts are for each.\n\n",

      "content": "T he point of yield management is to use demand  forecasts  to  determine  how  much  to charge  for  rooms  on  a  given  day. When  the hotel sells out, the ability to determine which reservations to accept or deny is lost, because all  requests  for  the  sold-out  date  (including those for multiple-night stays that involve the sold-out date) must be rejected. A property's yield management objective should be to sell out  the  hotel  as  close  to  the  arrival  date  as possible, because  the  further  in  advance  the hotel  is  sold  out  with  discounted  (or  shortstay)  business, the  greater  is  the  likelihood\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat high-value bookings will be turned away. This  forecasting  regime  requires  a  continual process of comparing remaining demand for high-rate  stays  (and  multiple-night  stays) against  remaining  available  inventory. Rate category controls help ensure available inventory to accommodate the projected high-rate demand.\n\nTable  4.1  demonstrates  how  rate  categories  are  controlled  to  increase  total  room revenue. The table assumes a 500-room hotel (or  a  hotel  with  500  rooms  remaining  to  be sold). The objective is to hold rooms open for high-rate  demand  without  leaving  a  large number of rooms unsold. In this example, although the hotel would prefer to sell all 500 rooms at rack rate, the hotel's managers project that they can sell 380 (or more) rooms at rack  rate. Their  inventory  plan  is  set  up  to maintain room availability for this forecasted high-rate  demand. The  managers  would  like to  sell  the  remaining  120  rooms  in  the  next rate category down (Bucket 1), but their demand forecast projects they will not be able to sell all 120 in that rate category. Based on current trends, however, even though they have a total of 500 rooms to sell, they won't be selling any rooms in the deep-discount category because there is sufficient demand at higher rates.\n\nWhen evaluating how well a property is managing its inventory, there are two basic indicators: (1) On dates the property is selling out, it should be observed how far in advance that sellout occurs; (2) if the property is not selling out, it must be determined whether the property ever turned away business as a result of discount controls or because the property had committed too many rooms to groupsthat is, if  a  group  does  not  pick  up  its  room block, did the hotel, as a result, refuse reservations from transient guests?\n\nFull-occupancy  dates  frequently  receive less  attention  from  property  managers  than one might expect, given the revenue potential of a sellout. One reason is that some properties are too slow in closing out discounts to restrict room availability to expected high-rate business. Hotels  do  close  the  discounts, but not always soon enough. A common practice is  to  set  threshold  levels  at  which  discounts are closed at a predetermined level (90 percent occupancy, for example). While this approach is well meant, all it succeeds in doing is preserving the last 10 percent of the hotel's inventory for high-value guests, when a proactive approach might shut down discounts earlier and gain the hotel even more high-paying guests (and revenue).\n\nAnother reason hotels often don't focus\n\nTable 4.1 Hypothetical Room Rate Structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non sold-out dates is that the persons responsible  for  managing  the  hotel's  inventory  are also usually responsible for high-profile tasks, including forecasting daily occupancy. Thus, a revenue  manager  may  spend  more  time  determining whether a particular date will run an occupancy of 65 percent or 75 percent than determining how to make the most out of excess demand on a projected l00 percent occupancy date.The process of forecasting a date's occupancy is important, but so is determining how to gain the most revenue from a sold-out date.\n\nFor all the time spent in month-end analysis  of  occupancy  levels, average  rates, and market comparisons, rarely is conclusive evidence found that properties perform as well as they could. Moreover, the more often those two questions are asked (i.e., did we fill too early? and did we turn away business on days we didn't fill?), the more employees work to give the desired revenue results. As occurs in many  cases, you  get  what  you  inspect, not what you expect.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I mplementing  length-of-stay  controls  takes the rate management decision a step further. The essence of rate category control is having one room left to sell and deciding whether to sell it to one guest for $100 today or to wait and  sell  it  to  another  guest  for  $150. The essence  of  length-of-stay  controls, on  the other hand, is having one room left to sell at $150 and deciding whether to sell it for one night or to wait, with the prospect of selling it to  another  guest  for  four  nights. In  the  rate\n\ncategory decision, the hotel can net an additional  $50, while  the  length-of-stay  decision can  generate  as  much  as  $450  in  additional revenue.\n\nManaging  stay  lengths  is  complex, but mastering length-of-stay patterns may be the most  rewarding  of  yield  management  functions. The most sophisticated inventory management controls requests down to granular levels of detail: by program or rate category, by length of stay, or by day. This level of control really requires an automated system. As is the case with managing rate discounts, however, measurable revenue improvements connected  to  length  of  stay  can  be  achieved without  sophisticated  automated  systems, as long  as  the  application  of  controls  is  kept fairly simple.\n\nJust as setting rate control categories requires  an  understanding  of  demand  by  rate category, length-of-stay management requires an  understanding  of  demand  by  various length-of-stay  intervals. To  make  the  call  in the  above  example, the  manager  needs  to know the level of demand for four-night stays before he or she turns away (or accepts) the request for a one-night stay.\n\nThe most common length-of-stay statistic used in the hospitality industry is average length  of  stay, which  describes  the  average duration of a guest's hotel stay over a range of dates. One needs more effective statistics than simple average length of stay to manage stay  patterns. What  the  revenue  manager needs to know is the total number of arrivals on  a  given  date  for  one  night, two  nights, three  nights, four  nights, five  nights, and  so forth. To  illustrate  the  difference  between those two statistics, imagine that a manager was determining whether to apply minimumstay  restrictions  on  a  peak  night. The  man-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nager could know that the average length of stay is 3.6 nights, or the manager could have specific  length-of-stay  information  (e.g., 10 percent of the arrivals on a given date are for one-night stays, 25 percent are for two-night stays, and  so  on). Naturally, the  manager wants to know how much of the demand will be  affected  if  he  or  she  were  to  reject  all one-, two-, and three-night stays with the expectation  that  the  hotel  can  be  filled  with people staying four or more nights. Table 4.2 shows an example of a chart with this type of information.\n\nMost  central  reservation  and  property management  systems  developed  in  the  last few  years  facilitate  stay  pattern  controls, although at varying levels of sophistication. The ideal system enables a property's managers to set  controls  for  each  arrival  date  by  discrete lengths  of  stay. Such  a  system  enables  the property  to  close  availability  to  one-, four-, five-, and eight-night stays, for instance, but allow  stays  of  two, three, six, seven, or  nine nights (or longer). Most new systems at least allow minimum-stay controls by rate category.\n\nCaution: One aspect of yield management systems' stay controls can become overused. Most  systems  allow  managers  to  place  a closed-to-arrival restriction on selected dates. This  restriction  enables  a  property  to  sell through stays arriving before the given datethat  is, multiple-night  stays  for  which  the closed date is a second or subsequent nightbut rejects all requests to arrive on that date. The problem hotels create for themselves by using this approach is that they end up saving space for two- and three-night stay-throughs while rejecting multiple-night stays by guests proposing to arrive on the closed night.\n\nObviously, the hotel does not want to lose revenue  from  stay-through  guests  to  those staying  for  just  the  closed  night, but  having the  system  forbid  a  multiple-night  stay  that begins  on  the  peak  night  may  actually  be worse than having no controls at all. In such a case, some form of minimum or other discrete length-of-stay  controls  is  appropriate. Any property still using a flat closed-to-arrival restriction  should  reconsider  in  light  of  this problem.\n\nTable 4.2 Hypothetical Stay-Length Forecast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Y ield  management  is  usually  thought  of  in the context of turning away undesirable business during excess demand periods. However, the real art of yield management is learning how  to  turn  undesirable  booking  requests into  desirable  ones. Thus, an  important  element of yield management is teaching all employees the art of saying yes.\n\nThe  art  of  saying  yes  is  particularly  important in negotiating group business, which generally  involves  decisions  about  rates, dates, and  space. Rates are  how  much  the group  is  going  to  pay; dates are  when  the group is going to be staying; and space is how many  rooms  the  group  will  use. Turning  an undesirable proposal into a desirable contract involves varying these components until both the  hotel's  sales  associate  and  the  meeting planners  have  what  they  consider  a  worthwhile  package. Too  often, hoteliers  either deny a  group's  request  outright  or  focus  on adjusting the group's proposed room rate to make the request appealing to the hotel. At times, the better response is to give the group the rate it requests but to change the dates of the proposed business to a time when the hotel's forecast is for empty rooms. Even less obvious is the option to ask the group to change the  number  of  rooms  it  proposes  to  block. Committing  to  more  rooms  (and  thus  more overall  revenue)  or  fewer  rooms  (reducing displacement)  leaves  the  opportunity  to  sell to a second group interested in your property.\n\nApplying  revenue  management  principles  to  group  business  involves  more  than changing a group's proposal from undesirable to  acceptable. Perhaps even more important is the ability to make a proposal that is merely\n\nacceptable  into  a  contract  that  represents  a great piece of business. Working within a hotel's normal acceptable boundaries, one thing that typically makes a proposed piece of business  undesirable  is  the  hotel's  ability  to  sell that space to others at a better profit margin. That's why the most common response to an unacceptable proposal is to ask for a higher price.\n\nTurning a mediocre proposal into an excellent piece of business might work as in the following  example. Say  that  one  group  requests 200 rooms at a 350-room hotel for $80 per room, which is a $16,000 piece of business that  was  really  not  expected. The  forecast shows  that  the  total  revenue  without  the group for that date would have been $29,000 with 290 rooms booked at an average rate of $100.The group's business will bring the hotel to 100 percent occupancy and generate a total of $31,000 in revenue (having displaced some of the forecasted transient arrivals). The revenue  on  the  60  extra  rooms  gives  the  hotel more  than  enough  incentive  to  accept  this group, with a $2,000 increase in total revenue. (Assume per-room ancillary spending offsets the variable costs on the extra rooms.)\n\nAny good sales  director  is  going  to  feel good about the $16,000 in business he or she helped  bring  to  the  hotel. Even  if  someone points  out  that  the  business  really  brought only $2,000 in additional revenue to the hotel, there  still  is  reason  to  feel  good  about  this arrangement. Another  way  to  look  at  this group, however, is that it represents $16,000 in unanticipated room revenue from which the hotel is extracting only an additional $2,000 in revenue  because  the  group  has  displaced higher-rate  business. By  manipulating  the other variables and, in this case, moving this group to a date that will displace little other business, the  hotel  can  extract  maximum\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvalue  from  this  group. Even  if  the  hotel needed to reduce the room rate to $60 to entice  the  group  to  move  to  other  dates, the added  value  would  be  $12,000  instead  of $2,000, because the group would be displacing less  (anticipated)  higher-rate  business. Note that the calculations for this example are for only  one  night, but  a  group  would  typically stay for multiple nights, thus amplifying both the  benefit  of  moving  the  group  and  the penalty for accepting the proposal as offered.\n\nThe  hotel  could  also  propose  that  the group's room block be smaller-for example, in a situation where the group is attending a convention  for  which  the  dates  are  already fixed. This proposal is less effective from both the  hotel's  point  of  view  and  that  of  the group, but  it  still  increases  the  value  of  the group. Because the forecast is that the group would  displace  140  rooms  that  would  have sold to transients at $100 each, the hotel gains back $20 in displaced revenue for every room sold to transients instead of to the group. Cutting  the  group's  room  block  in  half, for  instance, actually nets the hotel another $2,000 in  revenue. While the group has little incentive  to  reduce  its  request  for  rooms  (unless the  market  is  otherwise  sold  out), the  hotel could insist that the group block fewer rooms if the group's original offer did not make up for  revenues  the  hotel  would  have  obtained from transients.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "T his case study explains how Disney uses simple information about hotel guests' stay patterns  to  increase  revenues  at  their  Orlando resort hotels (Quain et al., 1998). One of the highest-demand  weeks  of  the  entire  year  in Central Florida is the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's Day. Ironically, this strong week is followed by one of the lowestoccupancy weeks of the entire year, the first week  of  January. Disney's  Orlando  resorts typically sell out the Christmas to New Year's dates by the end of September, if not sooner. But  the  first  week  in  January  has  been  a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nchallenge for Walt Disney World's marketers, who have developed programs and events to fill the void caused by the exit of the holiday crowd. Although  Florida  residents  can  be tempted with deep discounts to boost the occupancy for the month of January, the resorts cannot  develop  enough  demand  to  fill  their rooms one week following one of the biggest holidays of the year.\n\nDisney  took  many  creative  measures  to boost  the  resorts'  occupancy  that  week. For example, the Walt  Disney World  Marathon, which  was  originally  held  during  the  threeday Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend to help ensure the race's success, was moved to the first weekend of January.The move was a  win  for  both  the  race  and  the  hotels. The Martin Luther King holiday weekend maintained its strong occupancy levels without the marathon, and  the  end  of  the  first  week  of January  received  a  much-needed  occupancy boost  from  the  marathoners  and  their  families. The good news for racers, moreover, was that  more of them could find a room at the Walt  Disney World  resorts  because  they  no longer  had  to  compete  with  vacationers  for limited  rooms  over  the  King  holiday  weekend. Despite  the  marathon's  success, Walt Disney World's marketers knew this was not the  complete  answer, and  they  continued  to look for ways to increase hotel occupancy immediately following the holidays.\n\nAs  part  of  the  effort  to  increase  occupancy  during  the  first  week  of  January, the revenue  management  department  at  Disney began  studying  ways  to  use  minimum-stay controls in conjunction with New Year's Eve to preserve rooms for guests who wanted to stay beyond New Year's Day. This was in the early days of yield management, when lengthof-stay  controls  were  relatively  uncommon and a new corporate culture had to be devel-\n\noped. Such a seemingly extreme concept drew skepticism and concern within the company. Senior managers had to be reassured that this new form of controlling inventory would not end  up  causing  them  to  carry  empty  rooms during their busy season.\n\nIn another demonstration of how knowledge is power, the revenue management department  had  recently  developed  a  report that summarized arrivals by length of stay (a concept discussed by Cross, 1997). This report demonstrated  two  things: First, they  did  indeed have demand for guests arriving late in the holiday week and staying through several days into January; second, over 35 percent of arrivals during the holidays were guests staying three or fewer nights. Disney's estimates of  unconstrained  demand  over  the  holidays indicated it could easily afford to accept stays of four nights or longer only and still sell out its peak nights.\n\nTaking  a  deep  breath, Disney's  revenue managers set a minimum-stay restriction for arrivals  during  the  holiday  week  accepting reservations  for  four  nights  or  longer  only. This calculated decision was intended to improve revenue during the first week of January  while  presenting  minimal  risk  to  the normal strong revenues during the preceding holiday  week. The  experiment  attracted  attention  throughout  the  company. When  late September  came  and  the  resorts  were  not sold  out, some  people  were  concerned  the holiday might not fill. However, the forecast predicted the resorts would not be sold out by the usual late September date under the fournight minimum stay restraint. Because of the limitation, Disney was turning away shorterstay  requests  that  in  previous  years  would have been accepted (and sold out the holiday week by September), with the forecasted expectation that the resorts could book longer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstays to guests calling in October, November, and  even  early  December. Trend  reports helped affirm the resorts were still on a pace that  would  sell  out  the  hotels, which  eased some minds in the revenue management department. (It is worth noting that guests desiring  a  short  stay  could  be  offered  almost their pick of rooms the week after New Year's Day.)\n\nThe final results were well worth the effort and nail-biting. The hotels filled to capacity  over the holidays, having sold out in late October. Occupancy for the first week of January  rose  10  percentage  points, almost  entirely driven by guests arriving prior to New Year's  Day  and  staying  the  minimum  four nights. The room revenue contribution alone was worth over $1.5 million.\n\nDisney's  success  in  this  example  highlights  a  simple  principle  that  many  hotels miss. Disney  was  not  paralyzed  by  the  fact that  it  did  not  have  perfect  information  or that it was not in a position to maximize revenue with optimal inventory controls. Instead, Disney's revenue managers made use of the information  available  to  them  to  achieve  a measured  improvement  in  revenue  while minimizing their risk.\n\n",

      "content": "Mario Arnaldo\n\nI vividly remember my first and last contacts with a concierge.\n\nFirst  contact. Not  knowing  the  correct term, I  would  simply  have  called  him  'the Supe,' or  building  superintendent. We  had just moved to France after enjoying a year in Somalia, East Africa. My dad used to work for the United Nations, so we literally moved to different countries and continents every two or  three  years. This  time  our  home  was  an\n\napartment on the seventh floor of a well-used building in the immediate outskirts of Paris. We have our own concierge? Wow! And his name is Monsieur Guy de Roquefort? I was only  14  years  old, so  it  was  easy  to  get  impressed, or  disappointed. Well, Monsieur  de Roquefort's  scent  certainly  reminded  me  of the  cheese  with  his  namesake. He  was  unshaven and less than tidy. His uniform du jour was  an  undershirt, a stick of Gauloises\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(French cigarettes) in one hand and a glass of cheap beaujolais in the other. But Guy had a good heart, engaged me in titillating conversations  about 'cherchez  les  femmes' (much more  rewarding  than  the  four-hour  French lessons I had in school), always fixed the toilets that wouldn't flush, and delighted in announcing  every  single  piece  of  mail  we received. He  probably  would  not  get  within 50 feet of an employment agency. However, if I could give him a shower and a shirt, I would hire  him  in  a  heartbeat. Monsieur  Guy  de Roquefort's soul was in the right place. I still remember him, see? That was in 1964.\n\nI  fondly  remember my most recent contact with a concierge.\n\nLast  contact. This  article  was  written  in 2004. Forty years later is a long stretch of time after my first contact with a concierge.Thanks to  my  dad's  international  assignments, I've used up seven passports.Thanks to my two international airline jobs, I've filled up my last passport  with  immigration  stamps  from  32 cities in five continents. I have enjoyed a privileged opportunity to meet and work with a multitude of professionals, but one, in particular, in Seattle stays in my memory.\n\nShe was punctual. Polite. Charming. Endearing. Never  forgot  the  slightest  detail. Never  overbearing  or  invasive. Made  my socks  roll  up  and  down  with  legendary  service. Went way beyond the call of duty in answering the simplest of requests. 'Where can we get great fresh oysters? Where is . . .? How do we . . .?' It was as if my engagement and honeymoon  to  come  were  made  in  heaven. This was in 1997. Since then, she has faithfully written us every year during the holiday season  with  neat, short, handwritten, personal notes. Her envelopes are also written by hand. She  does  not  use  insensitive, computergenerated  labels. She  always  hopes  we  will\n\ncome back to visit her again and enjoy Seattle. She has never asked questions like, 'Can we  book  a  room  for  you?' We  correspond regularly about hospitality concepts to bring reality to my hospitality students, or ideas she can bring to her in-house training programs. On two occasions, Mr. Robert Thurston, managing general partner, enthusiastically gave us permission to study his hotel as a class project, long-distance from Honolulu!\n\nThat's Annie Delucchi, former concierge at the Inn at The Market, a great boutique hotel in Seattle, literally a shout away from Pike Place Market. Eight months prior to our arrival at the IATM, my fiancée and I had never met  Annie. All  our  interactions  were  via email. Not even a phone call. Annie has since been  promoted  to  executive  liaison  at  the IATM. Know  what?  If  my  wife  and  I  were given complimentary reservations at another Seattle property, we would still go to Annie's property and pay for our rooms. You see, I'm not  just  a  reservation  record  on  the  IATM database. I  can  be  me, someone  who  has  a preference  for  fresh  oysters!  My  wife  is  not 'the  Mrs.' She, too, can  be  herself. She  can spend the whole day walking back and forth to Pike Place Market to select just the right bouquet of fresh flowers or just the right jewelry  accessories. Annie  Delucchi's soul is  in the right place.\n\nWassup? During the fall 2003 semester, I was designing interactive games for my international  students  to  enjoy  as  part  of  our weekly class discussions. One of these games was the Concierge Game.This game is the basis for the research I did on concierges for this article.\n\nSo I reviewed the Withiam concierge articles, used Google to point me to a few hundred  pages  of  articles, scoured  dozens  of concierge-related websites, emailed and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntalked to dozens of hospitality professionals, and  finally  interviewed  concierges  in  Honolulu, Hawaii, to highlight six significant findings  about  the  modern  concierge. The  six findings  concern  passion, titles, technology, Les Clefs d'Or, stars, and Aloha!\n\nFinding  #1: Passion. The  concierges  and guest  service  staff  I  talked  to, whether  they had their keys or not, are, without exception, passionate about what they do. They all have what  some  have  called gotta-wanna, an  almost insatiable desire to exceed customer expectations with minor regard for themselves or the time clock.\n\nFinding #2: Titles. Got concierge? Job titles I compiled  included  concierge, head concierge, chef  concierge, concierge  supervisor, lobby concierge, guest service agent, guest services manager or supervisor, activity agent, and  the  more  recent  compcierge  and  technocierge, for  those  who  assist  road  warriors with laptops and other electronic paraphernalia. However, whether or not properties enjoy a keyed concierge, management must openly recognize  and  support  the  need  to  provide concierge  services. Anecdotally, seasoned concierges, no matter what they are titled, will tell  you, as  do  Nargil, Kahn, and  Peterson (2003) that 'one doesn't have to be at an upscale property to provide the kind of service that will keep guests coming back.' Presence of a concierge, keyed or not, is a plus when it comes to four-star and five-star ratings ( Mobil Travel  Guide )  or  four-diamond  and  fivediamond ratings (AAA). The concierges and guest service staff I met are part of front desk operations, with a designated area close tobut distinct from-the check-in area. When I visited some Honolulu hotels, the front desk areas appeared to have lulls in operation during  midmorning  hours, after  check-out  rush time, and before afternoon check-in times. In\n\ncontrast, the  concierge  area  appeared  to  be continuously busy whether midmorning, noon, afternoon, or early evening.\n\nMore and more organizations are answering 'Yes!' to the question 'Got concierge?'\n\nA fall 2003 television series, Life of Luxury, with  Robin  Leach, featured  one  of  the more exclusive U.K. concierge services, Quintessentially. Quintessentially, a  membership organization  affiliated  with  luxury  facilities worldwide, essentially  provides  the  same services  the  lobby-based  concierge  would without the restrictions of being in a facility. According to their website (www.quintessentially.com/home.php):\n\nQuintessentially aims to satisfy practically any last-minute whim our members may have, from front  row  seats  at  a  fashion  show  and  spur  of the moment chartered yachts, to impossible dinner reservations at some of the world's most exclusive  restaurants  and  last-minute  theatre tickets, and  with  24/7  member  telephone  and email assistance our experts are always on hand to  save  you  time, hassle  and  money. Fantastic offshoots of the Quintessentially brand include the  Quintessentially  magazine  and  the  exclusive  Quintessentially  'Beyond  Black'  credit card. Quintessentially members are also continuously  kept  up  to  date  with  what's  hot  and what's  not  through  our  weekly  newsletter, offering indispensable advice on the essential art and cultural events of the moment, as well as invitations to charity affairs, gala balls, shopping evenings, film  premieres  and  exclusive  afterevent parties.\n\nIn  the  middle  of  finalizing  this  article  in December  2003, my  own  university, Hawaii Pacific University, advertised its latest service. Guess what it was? Yep! A concierge desk to help  students  and  other  stakeholders  access and utilize the services of the university.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "cierge. I predict that no amount of technology will  ever  replace  the  concierge  or  guest  service  staff. Inger  Boudouris  and  the  other concierges  I  interviewed  or  emailed  agreed with this prediction. However, there is room to enjoy and take advantage of what the current technology has to offer. You don't have to look far. Check out the extensive usage of PDAs in last  fall's TV  series Las Vegas and The Threat Matrix. At one end of the technology  spectrum, the  Westin  Santa  Clara  uses Sony's Contact-ME for remote video conferencing  from  the  concierge's  home  (a  threehour  round-trip  commute)  directly  to  the hotel  lobby's  monitor, some  80  miles  away. After some weeks of emailing, I obtained permission from the Westin Santa Clara general manager and support from Clifford Planning, LLC, a  premier  Hawaii-based  architectural firm, to conduct a one-hour videoconference between Anna Morris and my hotel and resort  management students. We had a terrific experience; this  is  a  perfect  example  of  the application of technology to enhance a traditional service rather than replace it.\n\nAt  another  level  of  technology, interactive software programs such as GoConcierge (GC)  [http://www.goconcierge.net/home/]  allows  a  user  to  manage  and  provide  guests with  information  and  services  in  a  consistently  impressive  manner. Adam  Isrow, who designed and developed this interactive webbased program, provided me a username and password and gave me an opportunity to validate  and  confirm  for  myself  how  userfriendly  GC  was. I  predict  the  concierge's uniform  will  include  a  wireless  PDA, a camera-video cell phone, a software program similar to GoConcierge, and other electronic gadgetry. Isrow said in an interview:\n\nI think you appropriately summarize the commonality of the concierge position with passion! These  people  (generally  speaking)  love  what they  do, love  people, and  are  therefore  great people  to  be  around. I  enjoyed  your  prediction-video  cell  phone  and  a  PDA-I  don't think you are too far off!\n\nAnd then there's Mike Doi, a guest services  coordinator, sitting in the  Outrigger lobby  on  Waikiki  Beach, with  his  uncanny memory  for  names, places, phone  numbers and  his  reliable  Rolodex. He  does  have  a computer monitor at his desk, but like many concierges, prefers  not  to  use  it  while  interacting  with  a  guest. Mike  also  shifts  from speaking  English  to  Japanese  to  pidgin  and back  without  blinking  an  eyelash, on  the phone and with walk-ins who step up to his desk.\n\nOthers  exemplified  by  Dave  Nishi  and Sally Yates  agree  it  would  be  wonderful  for their properties to enjoy state-of-the-art technology, more computers, more staff, and more space. From  my  conversations  with  them, I found that  both  Dave  and  Sally  are  equally adamant about not letting the gadgetry come between the guest  and  the  service  provider. Know what? Dave, guest services manager at the Ohana Maile Sky Court, can't even spell Les  Clefs  d'Or, but  he  has  over  25  years  of customer service under his belt. Dave also has many  years  of  information  technology  (IT) experience, but  given  the  choice, says, 'I  always  prefer  to  deal  with  the  guests  face  to face. Sometimes you just can't trust your computer or PDA.' Sally is one of only a handful of  Les  Clefs  d'Or  concierges  in  Hawaii, and she has enjoyed  her  position as senior concierge at the Halekulani Hotel for over 10 years. She says, 'We enjoy working with our guests on a personal one-on-one basis at the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndesk, and  sometimes  the  computer  work takes us away from that service.' One concern we  discussed  was  maximizing  eye  contact with  the  guest, or  avoiding  interactions  that take your eyes away from the guest.\n\nI  found  these  statements  enjoyably  revealing  because  (a)  they  were  self-initiated, (b) Dave works in a three-star property and Sally in a four-star property, and (c) Dave and Sally have never met.\n\nFinding #4: Les Clefs d'Or (LCD) USA. In the original Withiam article on concierges (1983), there were about 40 members in LCD USA. Back then, many travelers didn't know whether  a  concierge  was  Mozart's  second movement in D flat or the alternate entrée. In 1993, there  were  200  U.S. concierges  in  the LCD  membership, and  the  savvy  traveler started looking for the concierge. Even in fiction, 007  (James  Bond)  had  his  hotel  contacts-concierges!  In  2003, there  were  450 concierge members in LCD USA representing over 100,000 rooms in 250 four- and fivestar properties.\n\nOver  3,400  international  members  from 37  countries  make  up  the  LCD  worldwide. The LCD headquarters in Paris is called the Union International des Concierges d'Hôtels. Although the concierge position is predominantly male in Europe and other countries, 53 percent of U.S. concierges are female.\n\nConcierges  continuously  network  with one  another  and  the  communities  in  which they work. Concierge associations are found in many cities throughout the United States. Some  only  admit  hotel  concierges  as  members (LCD as well as non-LCD concierges); others  include  local  vendors  and  employees from car rental agencies, tour companies, tour guides, restaurants, art  galleries, and  so  on (maybe  even  university  concierges!  Who knows?).\n\nMany  concierge  country  sections  also have  community-based  organizations. In  the United  States, for  example, Les  Clefs  d'Or Foundation  of  the Americas  (United  States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil) provides financial  support  and  in-kind  donations  of  goods and was founded to respond to the suffering of concierges and/or their families and significant  others  affected  by  catastrophic  or  lifethreatening illnesses.\n\nCharles  Holzer, director  of  media  for LCD USA and chef concierge at the RiverPlace Hotel in Portland, Oregon, explained to me:\n\nEach  [LCD  local  chapter]  is  different  in  its composition, yet  each  association's  purpose  is the same: to positively enhance the guest experience  through  knowledge, education, mentoring, networking, and friendship. In general, local meetings  consist  of  an  educational  element, whether  that  is  speakers  from  local  organizations, vendors, or attractions. This could also entail  bringing  in  members  from  the  hospitality industry to discuss strengthening the concierge desk, enhancing revenue, or working in a more supportive manner with management.\n\nAfter  I  interviewed  Inger  Boudouris  by phone, we  spoke  and  corresponded  many times. In one of our discussions, this is what Inger told me about concierges:\n\nYou  know, being a concierge is being a 'concierge  for  all  seasons,' because  you  must be able to turn around on a dime, multitasking and  at  the  same  time  making  important  decisions  while  talking  on  the  phone, et  cetera!  I love being a concierge because of what I call the unpredictable  challenges, and  it  makes  one's life very exciting-no day, no hour, no minute is the  same. There  is  no  time  for  stress  because you  are  always  in  the  midst  of  happenings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToday, it's  snowing. We  have  a  wedding  ceremony  in  our  lobby  this  afternoon. Afternoon tea will be served in the pub today, wedding receptions  everywhere, and  in  the  middle  of all  this, guests  will  be  checking  in  and  out-I love it!\n\nA brief but supremely informative phone interview  with  Shujaat  Khan, vice  president of LCD USA and chef concierge at the Capitol Hilton in Washington, D.C., revealed these weathered and tested beliefs:\n\nFinding  #5: Got  stars? Not?  Don  Massagli  (2002)  wrote  an  article  that  at  first glance appears to be a straightforward commentary  applauding  the  assurance, confidence, and  customer  relations  packaged  in your  hotel  concierge. The  reader  should know  that  Massagli  brings  an  uncommon perspective, as he is the senior vice president of  Park  Ridge, Illinois-based Mobil  Travel Guide (http://www.mobiltravelguide.com/). The Mobil Travel  Guide inspects  and  rates\n\nthousands of hotels and restaurants and publishes the travel guide and other travel publications. Coincidentally, I had an opportunity to interview Massagli in person; he repeated to me that concierges add a touch of distinction to any property, regardless of its star status. I predict  that  hotel  management  will pay  increasingly  more  attention  to  their concierge and concierge services, whether the property  has  two  stars  or  five. Jameson (Withiam, 1993)  sums  it  up  best: '[G]uests are  going  to  ask  the  kind  of  questions  that concierges  routinely  answer, regardless  of whether the hotel has a concierge desk.'\n\nFinding  #6: Aloha. (In  Hawaii, Aloha means more than just 'hello' or 'goodbye.' It also  refers  to  a  spirit  that  encompasses  welcoming, friendly accommodation that embodies giving the gift of friendship. -Editor)\n\nSilverman (Withiam, 1993) hit the nail on the head:'Does management create the environment to make exceeding expectations possible?' Probably  not  all  the  time. Whatever the  number  of  stars  the  property  has, management  must  continuously  maintain  a  dynamic  environment  enabling  all  employees, whether or not they work in guest services, to exceed guest expectations. So what is the energy  source  of  all  the  legendary  stories  of Houdini-like concierges? My interaction with concierges  in  Hawaii, the 'Land  of Aloha,' tells me that concierges are loyal and have a built-in desire to please and satisfy within legal and moral limits. The concierge in Hawaii makes  it happen  by  practicing  'service through Aloha.' And when he or she doesn't have that particular desired resource (the dinner reservation, a hard-to-find gift for the significant  other), he  or  she  knows  how  to network out the solution through Aloha with fellow concierges.\n\nAt the time of this writing, there was no\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLes  Clefs  d'Or  section  in  Hawaii, but  there are  several  Les  Clefs  d'Or  concierges  on Oahu, Kapolei, and the other popular resort areas  of  the  state. According  to  Pam  Davis, publisher of the Oahu Concierge newsletter:\n\nOur goal  is  to  disseminate  pertinent  information to the hospitality industry as a whole, focusing on the latest happenings, keeping them informed on recent changes and improvements at  places  they  might  very  well  recommend, as well as including industry changes and promotions. As  we  are  the  only  industry  publication on Oahu located in one of the few cities without an  official  [Les  Clefs  d'Or]  organization, we have an additional burden to try to fill that void by  holding  regular  gatherings  where  industry professionals  can  mingle  and  share  information, but  unfortunately  they  are  not  monthly, and they rarely (due to travel complications) include those from the outer islands.\n\n",

      "content": "T he  bell  stand  and  its  associates  are  important because they are usually the first and last encounter the guest has with the hotel and its staff. Traditionally, the  bell  staff  was  considered concierge as well, as they usually had the best  insider  knowledge  about  the  location and attractions, and they always had a friend or  relative  working  there  as  well  to  get  the guest a special deal. This is still the case in hotels  where  the  bell  staff  has  been  with  the property for many years. In newer properties, it is primarily the concierge who has this kind of connection. The basic duties of a bell person include but are not limited to handling incoming and outgoing guest luggage, greeting arriving and departing guests as they enter or leave the hotel lobby, storage of luggage for guests, and being present in the lobby area to answer questions or assist the guests with any requests they might have. Specific tasks differ from property to property.\n\nDepending on a property's check-in and check-out  procedures, the  bell  staff  may spend a significant  amount  of  time  with  the guest, accompanying him or her to the room\n\nand explaining the features of the hotel and its  surroundings. This  is  a  key  encounter  for the hotel, as the bell staff has a lot of influence on  the  guest, enabling  the  staff  to  steer  the guest  toward  the  hotel's  outlets  and  amenities. This, of course, is only possible and effective if the associates are trained properly and have the necessary knowledge about the hotel offerings. The bell staff gets a lot of information from guests about their stay, experience, and  encounters, and  about  the guests themselves. This kind of information is invaluable  for  the  hotel. If  proper  reporting channels are in place, the hotel can be proactive in addressing an incident before the guest considers it a problem. This information also helps  the  hotel  recognize  special  occasions like birthdays and anniversaries.The bell staff is the hotel's eyes and ears, the ambassadors for the property. It is important to understand their significance and the influence they have on the hotel and front office operation.\n\nThe  bell  stand  is  usually  located  in  the main entrance area, easily accessible by both guests and staff. It is usually close to a storage room  where  luggage  and  other  guest  items can  be  stored. The  bell  stand  should  have  a telephone with an outside line to enable the staff to  make  reservations, inquire  about hours  of  operations, and  so  on. A  computer with access to the Internet and the property management  system  (PMS)  allows  the  bell staff not only to provide the latest online information  but  also  access  guest  information like  room  numbers  and  contact  information or to leave messages on guest accounts. Maps and informational material about attractions in  the  surrounding  area  help  the  bell  staff point guests in the right direction after making recommendations about leisure activities. If no printer is attached to the computer, preprinted driving directions to popular destina-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntions  (e.g., airport, train  station, landmarks) can be handed out to guests.\n\nLuggage tags are used to label guest luggage for storage. There are usually two parts to the ticket, one for the bag/item and the second  for  the  guest  to  claim  the  stored  items later. The storage room should be big enough to handle the storage demands for the property. The shelving should be arranged and labeled to reflect the numbers or letters on the luggage tags. This makes it easier for the bell staff to store and retrieve items, and it keeps the  storage  room  organized  and  clean. The bell  stand  should  also  be  equipped  with plenty  of  luggage  carts. Those  carts  should match  the  decor  and  category  of  the  hotel (you probably do not want to use a wooden dolly  in  a  five-star  property). The  bell  staff must ensure that  the  carts  are  kept  in  good condition.This includes polishing the metal or brass  parts  as  well  as  maintaining  the  carpeted  area  and  wheels  to  ensure  proper functionality.\n\nAnother important item for the bell stand is  a  so-called  trip  log, a  simple  spreadsheet where the staff marks the room numbers of check-ins  and  check-outs  they  performed. This log is a great help if you have to retrace a  luggage  delivery  or  pickup  or  simply  as  a tool  to  communicate  which  room  is  next. Sometimes  luggage  gets  delivered  to  the wrong room, but the trip log helps the staff rectify the situation immediately.\n\nThe bell stand is a front-of-the-house area with direct guest contact. It is important that this area is kept clean and organized. The bell staff  must  ensure  that  they  are  wearing  the proper uniform and that the uniform is in top condition. In order for the staff to attend to all guest requests and questions, it is imperative for them to have all the necessary knowledge  before  they  start  their  shift. Helpful\n\ntools that ensure daily information is communicated to the front-of-the-house staff include a pre-shift meeting, where the important details for the day are being discussed, a white board  with  information  on  it, or  a  daily newsletter in everybody's mailbox. However, it  is  the  front  office  manager's responsibility that  the  associate  either  attend  the  pre-shift meeting or read the information provided on the whiteboard or newsletter to get the necessary information for their shift (as a front office  manager, you can make this part of the shift, and therefore the property's attendance policy applies).\n\nThe bell staff itself should be trained like any other front-of-the-house staff. First of all, it is important to hire the right candidates. As a  front  office  manager, you  look  for  applicants  who  are  outgoing, comfortable  with working in public, well groomed, and articulate, and who have a good understanding of service  and  a  positive  attitude. It  is  always better to interview more candidates to make sure you find the right person for the job than to  go  with  the  first  decent  applicant. Never compromise  when  it  comes  to  hiring  great staff!\n\nOnce a new bell person is hired, proper training  is  key. A  possible  training  rotation should  include  housekeeping  (great  insight into the room setup, the different room types, and locations), front desk (basic check-in and check-out  procedures  and  basic  knowledge about the property management system), the outlets  (knowledge  about  the  restaurant menu, spa  offerings, etc.), loss prevention (first aid, security, and emergency  procedures), as  well  as  basic  training  to  cover the  phones-and, of  course, guest  contact etiquette.\n\nOnce the staff member completes the required training and is working regular shifts,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nregular performance checks should be implemented to ensure knowledge stays up to date. It is the front office manager's responsibility to  supply  the  bell  staff  with  the  appropriate tools and information to perform their duties. Therefore, regular meetings are necessary to communicate any changes or additions and to collect feedback from the staff. The bell staff is  at  the  front  of  the  line. Their  input  is  invaluable  for  the  front  office  operation. It  is important to stop everything, listen, and use their  information  to  adjust  and  improve  the front  office  operation  and, ultimately, the guest experience. It has proven helpful in my workplace  to  cross-train  other  associates  at the bell stand as well. Associates in loss prevention, room service, the front desk, or any other department are then able to help out at the bell stand if necessary. Sometimes, checkins come in waves, and the current bell staff might not be able to get bags to guest rooms in  a  timely  manner. Having the flexibility of calling associates from other departments to help  out  ensures  guest  satisfaction  and  is  a nice change for the other associates.\n\nBecause in many cases the bell stand is located in a high-traffic area and is the first area the  guest  sees  and  interacts  with, the  hotel must make sure that the guest's first and last impressions are positive.\n\n",

      "title": "▶ FRONT DESK",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he  front  desk  or  reception  area  is  where staff-guest  interaction  is  probably  most  intense. The  front  desk  manages  the  room  inventory as well as the check-in and check-out process  and  the  account  activities  for  each guest in house. The front desk assigns rooms to the arriving guests according to their preferences and requests (many properties have a staff person, called the rooms controller, who\n\nis in charge of assigning rooms to incoming individual  guests  and  groups). This  is  the  department  with  the  most  traffic  in  the  front office  area. The  agents  deal  with  the  checkin/check-out procedures, handle cash, resolve conflicts, address reservation/billing inquiries, and perform guest services. They have to be jacks-of-all-trades  because  the  front  desk  is the most important access point for information, complaints, and requests at the hotel.\n\nThe  front  desk  is  usually  located  in  the lobby  area  (sometimes, in  high-rise  properties, the  front  desk  is  located  on  a  higher floor), easily  accessible  from  the  main  entrance door and the guest room elevators. In some properties, front desks take the form of individual  islands  instead  of  a  long  counter. The advantage is that the agent can access the lobby area much more quickly to greet or assist the guest. The desk is divided into several equally  equipped  workstations. The  number of workstations depends on the size of the hotel. A good rule of thumb is 1 workstation per 100 guest rooms. Each workstation has (this again  varies  from  property  to  property)  a computer or PMS terminal with a credit card swiper  and  printer, room  key  encoder, telephone, reference  guide  with  information about room location, outlet location, currency exchange, market codes, rate codes, technical support  information, cash, credit  card  and check  handling  instructions, emergency  procedures, and other property-related information. It is vital that this folder-an important front-desk tool-is in order and up to date at all times. Other necessities for each workstation  include  paper  and  pens, area  maps, key cards, key  sleeves, and  scissors. As  with  the bell  stand, it  is  important  to  keep  workstations clean and organized at all times, as they are all in direct view for the guest and reflect on the hotel's operation.\n\nThe primary tasks for a front desk associ-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nate are the check-in and check-out of guests. During the check-in process, the agent should verify  specific  information  related  to  the guest's reservation. The information includes but  is  not  limited  to  duration  of  stay, requested room type or room preference, room rate (it is important for the front desk agent to verify the guest's eligibility for discounted rates  by  checking  membership  cards  [e.g., AAA or AARP], company IDs, government credit  cards), special  requests  or  arrangements, method of payment, and any frequentstay membership/airline affiliation. The verification  of  this  information  is  important to  avoid  discrepancies  in  the  billing  process and adjustments during check-out, and to ensure accuracy in room availability.\n\nDiscrepancies  in  the  billing  process  can be time-consuming and therefore a significant inconvenience to the guest. It is important to verify  the  room  rate  during  the  check-in process  (especially  if  a  guest's  room  rate changes during the stay); otherwise, the front desk  must  adjust  revenue  during  the  checkout  process, which  takes  extra  time  and  affects  the  room  revenue  figures  negatively. Billing  discrepancies  are  the  most  common reason for guest complaints.\n\nThe  verification  of  length  of  stay  helps the front desk manage room inventory more accurately. Especially in a sold-out situation, the hotel depends on all guests who are supposed to check out, according to the property management system, to actually check out, as their rooms have been sold to other guests for the night. If a guest's departure date is incorrect and he or she needs to be extended, the hotel may find itself in an oversold situation. This  causes  a  chain  reaction  of  additional problems and costs. If a guest's actual length of stay is shorter than the property management system shows (because it was not verified during check-in) and the guest checks out\n\nearlier  than  expected, the  hotel  might  have lost an opportunity to sell the room.Accuracy is  thus  very  important  to  maximizing  hotel revenue. However, there  will  be  occasions where guests depart before the confirmed departure date. It is up to the individual property or chain if an early departure fee (usually one night-room and tax) is charged.\n\nThe correct  room  type  and  location  can be essential to guest satisfaction. Selection is a matter of training and experience, as there are several  aspects  to  consider  when  allocating rooms  to  reservations. The  order  of  importance of the criteria may depend on local or corporate standard operating procedures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrepeating  business. Benefits  of  higher membership level  benefits  (usually  platinum or gold level) include room type and upgrade guarantees. Some programs even penalize the individual property if those guarantees  are  not  met. This  shows  the importance companies place on these frequent  guests  and  the  money  they  spend with  the  chain. In  addition, many  hotels have  developed  local  repeat  guest  programs to acknowledge and reward guests who  frequently  stay  with  one  specific property. These guests are not necessarily members of the hotel company's reward program.\n\nIn addition, special requests on the reservation might include information about allergies, rollaway  and  baby  crib  requests, high floor/low  floor, request  for  a  universally  accessible  room, and  so  on. Property  management  systems  have  codes  that  identify  such requests.This helps when printing reports and\n\nwhen  the  front  desk  associate, during  the check-in  process, verifies  that  the  requests and guarantees are met.\n\nA method of payment must be secured either  prior  to  check-in  (e.g., for  a  prepaid reservation)  or  during  the  check-in  process. Payment  can  be  made  in  cash  or  by  valid credit card or check; some properties also accept money orders. In most cases, a credit card imprint is made during check-in, either electronically  or  manually. The  total  amount  of room and tax and an incidental amount (for phone calls, movies, room service, etc.) are authorized on the credit card to secure payment. The incidental amount varies from property to property, depending on guest room amenities and services. If a guest wishes to use cash, an equivalent amount should be collected and deposited  on  the  guest  account. Each  property management system checks regularly to see  if  the  authorized  amount  has  been  exceeded and, if so, authorizes additional funds on the guest's credit card. Any guest account without sufficient authorization appears on a credit  limit  exceed  report, which  the  front desk runs regularly. Local standard operating procedures determine the next steps the front desk  associate  takes. Usually, the  front  desk tries  to  contact  the  guest  via  phone  or  text message. However, if  the  guest  does  not  respond to any of the messages, the front desk might go as far as locking the guest out of his or her room.This requires the guest to stop by the  front  desk  to  get  a  new  key  issued-a good  time  to  inquire  about  an  alternative method of payment or to ask for an additional cash deposit.\n\nIt is important for the front desk associate to  know  that  when  guests  use  a  debit  card during  check-in, the  amount  authorized  will not  be  available  for  the  guest  to  withdraw from  the  checking  account  until  he  or  she checks  out  of  the  hotel  and  the  hold  is  re-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nleased. It should be part of the check-in procedure to inform the guest about this before taking an electronic imprint of a debit card. However, if necessary, the front desk can release  holds  on  credit  card  and  checking  accounts immediately by contacting the appropriate  bank  directly. The  number  for the  institution  can  be  found  on  the  back  of the  credit/debit  card. Most  front  desks  are equipped  with  a  check  verification  system (similar to grocery stores). If a guest decides to pay by check, the front desk associate can get  immediate  clearance  to  secure  payment and avoid bounced checks.\n\nThroughout the day, the front desk associate spends a significant amount of time providing  guest  services  including  directions, restaurant and  activity recommendation, reservations, and rate inquiries.Therefore, it is important  that  all  front  desk  associates  receive  detailed  training  in  these  areas. It  is helpful  for  all  new  front  desk  associates  to spend  a  few  days  in  other  departments (housekeeping, concierge, maybe  even  the restaurant)  to  learn  about  them  and  their mode of operation.\n\nWorking in housekeeping gives the front desk  associate  great  knowledge  about  room setup, location, amenities, and views, but also an appreciation for the work the housekeeping  staff  does. Working  with  the  concierge helps the front desk associate learn about the area  and  its  attractions  and  activity  options for  the  guests. With  all  this  knowledge, the front desk associate can handle the majority of  guest  requests  and  questions, and  the check-in  process  is  faster, as  the  associate knows  everything  about  the  room  type  and location. It is helpful for the associate to visit a guest room once in a while to get refamiliarized with the room types and locations and learn about any changes made to the setup or amenity offering. Training is definitely an on-\n\ngoing  process. In  addition, the  associate should be familiar with the in-room technology, like high-speed  Internet  access  and movie  systems. This, of  course, not  only  includes knowing how to connect to the Internet and how to order a movie but also what movies  are  currently  showing  on  the  hotel channel.\n\nMost hotels these days provide an express check-out option. A copy of the guest's folio is delivered to the guest room the morning of check-out. The guest may use this as the receipt and need not have to stop by the front desk to check out (only if the billing is accurate, of course). Many in-room entertainment systems also feature a video check-out option, which allows the guest to check out through the  TV  screen. However, this  works  only  if sufficient  funds  are  secured  in  advance  to cover the balance on the account. To this day, though, many companies require their associates to present a zero balance receipt for their expense report. Therefore, there is still significant check-out traffic at the front desk.\n\nDuring this process, the front desk associate  verifies  that  all  charges  are  correct  and confirms the method of payment on the account. The guest still has the option of changing to a different method at this point. During check-out, the  associate  should  also  verify that  the  guest  has  a  frequent-stay  membership number on file, and if not, inquire about the  guest's  membership  to  ensure  proper credit. At  the  end  of  the  check-out  process, the  front  desk  associate  should  offer  assistance with luggage and transportation and, of course, thank the guest for staying at the hotel. This  is  the  last  opportunity  for  the  front desk  to  get  feedback  from  the  guest. If  the guest  experienced  any  problems  during  the stay, the hotel may lose the chance to rectify the  situation  and  compensate  the  guest. Therefore, it  is  useful  to  inquire  about  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nguest's experience while processing the check-out request.\n\nThe  initial  training  of  newly  hired  front desk associates is crucial to guest and associate satisfaction. Unless the front office manager  provides  the  associates  with  the  right tools  from  the  beginning, the  service  encounter can become a frustrating experience for  the  associate  and  guest. Initial  training should include a rotation so the associate can experience  other  departments, see  how  departments interact, and become familiar with the  property, its  features, and  its  offerings. However, training should be ongoing. It can be  in  the  form  of  on-the-job  training  (new processes and procedures, revisiting associate actions to discuss alternative solutions for the future), a daily 15 minutes of learning, where a new topic is discussed every day, or specific job-related  training  classes  (problem  resolution, service  recovery  models, public  speaking, interpersonal  skills). Secret  shoppers, organized by the front office manager, can be helpful  in  identifying  opportunities  for  improvement. Using friends and family for this purpose gives them a fun night out and provides the department with valuable information about the team's performance.\n\nAgain, success  starts  with  a  good  hiring process. You should look for certain characteristics when interviewing applicants for the front  desk. Candidates  should  be  very  comfortable  with  working  in  the  public  arena. They must be able to multitask in a fast-paced environment and able to handle stressful conflict  situation  without  losing  their  cool. As with  all  front-of-the-house  jobs, candidates should  be  well  polished  and  groomed  and should  possess  a  service-oriented  personality-the willingness to  go  the  extra  mile  for guests and fellow associates.\n\nThe  front  desk  is  the  front-of-the-house nerve center of the hotel.You want to be sure\n\nthe best associates are represented here. Selecting and training these associates is one of the  main  responsibilities  of  the  front  office manager. Providing them with the right tools to do their job well is key to success and guest satisfaction.\n\n▶\n\n",

With reference to this information, the  staff  can  place  certain  items  the guest usually requests in the room when he or she  returns.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The other important use for such a system is the  analysis  of  the  data  logged  through  the guest's  requests. It  is  important  that  all  requests and issues are logged in order to make this  process  work. It  is  up  to  the  hotel-or, more specifically, the front office manager or guest relations manager-to extract information from the system and learn from it.\n\nRequests: Reports  show  the  requests (e.g., towels, in-room  coffee)  made  from which  guest  rooms. This  information  can  be helpful in several ways. Towels and coffee are basic  room  amenities  and  should  always  be there. An increase in the number of these requests  should  catch  the  manager's  eye. Reports  can  be  narrowed  by  floor  or  even  by housekeeping  section  to  see  if  the  performance of a particular housekeeper is the reason  for  those  increased  requests  (i.e., items are not replenished when  the room  is cleaned). On the other hand, if the requests do not show a clear pattern, one might want\n\nto consider other reasons. For example, during  the  summer, people  take  towels  to  the pool, so  you  might  experience  requests  for clean  towels  when  guests  get  back  to  the room. This finding might lead the hotel to increase the number of towels in the rooms in summer. This will reduce the number of calls from the guests, reduce the time spent delivering  towels, and  thus  free  up  time  to  take care of other guest requests faster. Similarly, an increased number of requests for mouthwash might cause the hotel to add mouthwash to the basic bathroom amenity set.\n\nIncidents: Reports  show  any  problems guests  experience  during  their  stay  (only, of course, if the guests report them). These data help the hotel identify topics for retraining (in case of service issues) as well as engineeringrelated opportunities. Again, with the reports these systems allow the hotel to produce, you can narrow the problem to specific associates (in cross-referencing with department schedules), specific  rooms, or  mechanical  equipment such as a malfunctioning plumbing riser, hot water pump, or electrical appliances. For example, an  increased  amount  of  calls  for  a burned-out light bulb in a specific room might be an indicator for a broken-or dangerouslight  fixture; several  calls  from  a  room  indicating that the HVAC system is not working might signal a clogged filter.\n\nIf a hotel has such a reporting and tracking  system in place, it  is  essential  that  every staff member is behind it and reports every issue or problem so it can be entered into the database. (The concept of 'garbage in, garbage  out' is  relevant  here.)  The  support for  this  initiative  must  start  at  the  top: The general manager must give full support. This is the only way to convince everybody else to work with the system as well. This is the only way to make these systems produce accurate results that could save hotels a lot of money.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo reiterate, training the associates in the guest  relations  department  is  critical  and probably  more  intense  than  other  departments. The  associates  must  be  familiar  with literally everything, as  they  must  respond  to every  request  and  complaint. The  hiring process should be similar to that at the front desk, as the characteristics of a potential guest relations  associate  are  the  same. Training should  likewise  include  a  rotation  through every department to develop the insight and product  knowledge  that  will  help  the  staff member make the right decision. Service recovery and problem resolution training is key as well and should be a constant part in the associate development. Computer training is important too.Working with the different systems is a big part of associates' responsibilities, and the more comfortable they are with the  systems, the  faster  they  will  be  able  to work with them. The associates in the guest relations  area  are  the  hotel's  eyes  and  ears, but all staff and management must be aware of the importance of this area.\n\nWorking in the hospitality industry, with its crazy hours, stressful and challenging situations, weekend and holiday obligations, and so on, requires passion. If you love what you do, the rewards will come. I would not want to work in any other industry. For me, it is the greatest  reward  when  a  guest  or  associate thanks me for what I do.\n\n",

Talking to your staff shows them you are interested in their lives and you value their feedback. This is also a good opportunity to get information about problems from the previous evening and night you need to follow up with.\n\nChecking emails and voice mails and trying to return them in a timely manner ( very challenging).\n\nMr. X is at the desk complaining about his room service breakfast and wants to talk to a manager. I meet with Mr. X and take care of the issue. After the conversation, I follow up with the room\n\n9:00-\n\n9:15 A.M.\n\n9:15 A.M.noon\n\n10:0010:15 A.M.\n\nservice staff and the food and beverage manager to ensure the issue has been addressed. I double-check that the incident is entered into our guest relation database so Mr. X does not experience it again when he returns.\n\nMorning meeting with all the managers. This is the daily meeting where we discuss the previous day, the current day's events, VIPs, special guests, repeat customers, and any announcements pertaining to the overall operation (scheduled site tours, media appearances, managers out of the office, etc.).\n\nWork in the lobby with the associates. Meet and greet our regular guests and help out at the bell stand. This is what we call being the lobby ambassador. I also cover the breaks for the front desk associates to ensure proper staffing at all times. Ensuring your associates take breaks is important-and the law.\n\nMr.Y, a repeat customer, calls inquiring about his next stay. His usual rate is not available and he does not want to pay the available rate, which is significantly higher. I negotiate with Mr.Y, and we agree on\n\nthe regular rate (impor- tant if your company has a best rate guarantee); in addition I guarantee him an upgrade for his upcom- ing stay.\n\nNoon-\n\nLunch (this is not a regular occurrence).\n\n12:30 P.M.\n\n12:30-\n\nCatching up with emails and voice mails (between other things).\n\n2:00 P.M.\n\n12:40- 1:00 P.M.\n\nAssociate X calls off for the evening shift. It will be a busy evening, so I need to find a replacement soon. Associate Y offers to stay a little longer. I call the night auditor, and he agrees to come in early. The shift is covered.\n\n1:00- 1:30 P.M.\n\nMeeting with Associate Z to go over her performance review. Regular feedback is important. You want to make sure your associates are aware of their per- formance. This helps them identify areas of opportu- nity and makes them grow. It is the responsibil- ity of the front office manager to provide such feedback either in official reviews or in-the-moment coaching.\n\n1:30-\n\nI am paying my invoices. Accounting and finance knowledge is important to department managers. The department budget is your responsibility, and you have to be able to\n\n2:00 P.M.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nread and interpret financial statements to control your budget and secure your contribution to the bottom line.\n\n2:00-\n\n3:00 P.M.\n\n3:003:30 P.M. 3:304:00 P.M.\n\n4:004:15 P.M.\n\nOperations meeting. We critique the events of the past week and discuss details about the events for the coming week. This is an important way to collect information regarding check-in and check-out times, group VIPs and contacts, arrival patterns, room preferences, meeting schedules and locations, etc. Such information is crucial to scheduling as well as preparations such as prekeying guest rooms, setting up remote check-ins, etc.\n\nInterview with an applicant for the front desk.\n\nI walk all my areas and meet and greet the associates of the evening shift. I want to make sure everybody is okay and has the tools to do their job right. I also want to make sure to hear about issues (guest or associate) early before they become serious problems.\n\nMrs. Y wants to talk to a manager because we do not have an upgraded room available for her. I talk to Mrs. Y and explain the sold-out situation. I com-\n\n4:305:00 P.M.\n\n5:006:30 P.M.\n\n6:307:00 P.M.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npensate her with access to our VIP lounge. She is satisfied and checks into her room. A lot of times guests who are complaining and want to speak to a manager just want to be heard. Good listening skills and demeanor are important to show credibility to the guest.\n\nMeeting with the director of room operations to discuss the sports team check-in for the next day. Proper preparation is key to success and a smooth operation.\n\nI am in the lobby, helping my staff during the peak check-in time. Here I also have the opportunity to interact with our guests, welcome our repeat customers, and assist wherever necessary. Being in the lobby makes you accessible to your guests; talking to them, listening to them gives you a lot of information and feedback. I cannot stress enough the importance of this feedback for your operation; it is a great learning source for everybody. It also helps cover the front desk while the P.M. shift takes their breaks.\n\nI walk all my areas one last time before I leave to make sure everything is\n\ngoing well and everybody is happy. I make sure all my associates know how to contact me if necessary. I stop by my office to\n\ncheck for emails and voice mails one last time, and then I leave for the day.\n\n",

She also spent a significant  amount  of  time  learning  the  job  of front office manager and concluded that it is significantly  different  from  that  of  assistant front office manager in a smaller property.\n\nThe  front  office  staff  are  young, mostly students, who  are  in  South  Florida  for  the weather and the social amenities. Many want to become actors and are active in dinner theaters  and  small  theater  companies  in  the greater  Miami  area. For  the  most  part, they are bright and attractive people, but they lack the  professionalism  that  comes  from  a  solid core  of  knowledge  and  training. Among  the things that concern Jennifer as FOM are the following:\n\nthat are out of order, not clean, or already occupied.\n\nJennifer  believes  her  relations  with  her staff are pretty good. Her relationships, however, with  other  managers  in  the  hotel  are strained, particularly with housekeeping and sales.\n\nAs Jennifer seeks to understand the complexities  of  these  problems, she  decides  to compile a  list  of  their  possible  causes.

      "content": "Nancy Swanger\n\nMorgan Black has been described by the corporate office as the Miracle Worker because of  the  troubled  properties  that  were  turned around  under  Morgan's  leadership. It is hoped the story at the Coug Inn will have the same happy ending; however, the Coug Inn is in a remote location, hundreds of miles from any other corporate properties.\n\nThe Coug Inn is a 150-room full-service property  with  several  medium-sized  conference rooms; it caters mostly to business travelers  and  visitors  affiliated  with  the  local university. The bulk of the revenue is generated between August and May, with periods when  classes  are  not  in  session  being  extremely  slow. The  hotel  is  at  full  occupancy only  during  football  weekends  and  commencement. Occupancy  has  been  declining for  the  last  year  or  so, with  last  month's RevPAR at a record low. Since arriving at the Coug Inn, Morgan has made several observations about the hotel's situation. It seems that most of the problems involve the front desk. After  analyzing  several  previous  months' comment cards and informally chatting with guests  at  the  hotel, Morgan  has  sensed  real dissatisfaction with the check-in process. Several  common  themes  have  emerged: The process seems to take forever, the paperwork at check-in is perceived as lengthy and hard to fill out, the front desk clerks always appear to be  running  around 'like  chickens  with  their heads cut off,' and guests have been checked into rooms that were not clean.\n\nAfter  discussing  the  problems  with  the\n\nfront desk manager, Morgan is in a quandary about  how  best  to  move  toward  a  solution. The  front  desk  manager  complains  that  the reservations staff does not always submit the day's reservations to the front desk in a timely manner. Thus, guests  arrive, and  the  desk clerks have no idea what rate was quoted or the room preference of the guest. This results in  the  guest  having  to  refurnish  information that  was  previously  given  when  making  the reservation. Many times, clerks are forced to leave the guest at the counter while they attempt  to  retrieve  missing  information  from the reservations. Further, with over 65 percent of the housekeeping staff speaking a first language other  than  English, communication  is difficult at best, and room status is often mistaken. The front desk manager suggests that the  hotel  advertise  its  check-in  time  to  be from 'say around 1:00 P.M. or 2:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M.' to  reduce  the  crunch  time  and  allow front desk clerks more time to work with each guest's  check-in  needs. The  front  desk  manager further states that the new hotel in town, the Suite to Sleep Inn, has an earlier check-in time and 'it seems to work okay for them!' Morgan asks the front desk manager how the staff might respond to moving to a fully automated property management system. The response  was  not  favorable; the  front  desk manager  mumbled  something  about  'old dogs and new tricks' and that the corporate office had not put any money into the place in years. What would make Morgan think they would put out the cash now?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  an  attempt  to  reach  a  compromise, Morgan considers changing the check-in time in  exchange  for  the  front  desk  manager's support  of  the  conversion  to  an  automated system.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A while back, I was talking with a large group of housekeeping directors representing most of  the  major  metropolitan  hotels  in  a  large northeastern city. I asked the following question: How many of you, as part of your career plan, initially  considered  housekeeping  as  a managerial  role  that  had  any  attraction  to you? The answer, not surprisingly, was none!\n\nThis  points  up  a  major  dilemma  facing modern hotel management structures. One of the most important, most labor-intensive, and largest cost centers in the hotel is neither universally understood nor respected by the bulk of the hotel's department managers, their employees, and, to  a  large  extent, the  hotel's guests and clients. Some encouraging signs indicate  that  this  situation  is  in  a  state  of change. Some  hotel  companies  are  experi-\n\nmenting with taking housekeeping out of the rooms division and making it a staff function, with  the  director  of  housekeeping  reporting directly  to  the  general  manager. Others  are combining housekeeping and other property management functions such as maintenance and engineering. At one firm's resorts, housekeeping directors are titled Director of Services and have responsibility for all nongolf  recreation  in  addition  to  traditional housekeeping.\n\nHistorically, however, information  on housekeeping  administration  for  hotels  has been  organized  around  models  set  forth  in textbooks that date to the 1951 treatment of hospital  housekeeping  by  LaBelle  and  Barton. Brigham  (1955)  focused  her  analysis  of the  structure  of  the  housekeeping  functions and responsibilities on the small hotel.Tucker and Schneider (1982), Schneider and Tucker\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1989), and Martin and Jones (1992) provided a comprehensive inventory of the theoretical constructs, responsibilities, relationships, and techniques  important  to  the  modern  housekeeper  in  a  range  of  operational  situations. (See the Jones contribution elsewhere in this section that updates those authors.)\n\nGenerally speaking, these works present information  in  a  traditional  structure  that says the housekeeper administers four major areas of responsibility:\n\n(Tucker and Schneider 1982, 38)\n\nIn analyzing the differences between the folklore and  fact of the manager's  job, Mintzberg (1975) concluded that substantial differences  existed  between  the  popular  or academic notion of managers' jobs and their actual work.\n\nIn  the  last  study  of  its  type, Rutherford and  Schill  (1984)  studied  housekeepers  in  a similar fashion. They addressed this question: What  is  the  relationship  between  what  has been  written  about  housekeeping  and  what housekeeping  directors  themselves  deem important?\n\nA survey was sent to a national sample of housekeeping executives asking them to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 the importance of 100 theoretical  constructs  common  to  the  housekeeping literature. Statistical procedures (factor  analysis)  grouped  the  housekeepers' responses into eight groupings. While the traditional responsibilities of records, costs, supplies, and furnishings were still important, the issues  central  to  the  management  of  people\n\nwere  of  overwhelming  importance. Specifically highlighted were the following:\n\nThe authors concluded that new arrangements  of  traditional  knowledge, constructs, and  tactics  such  as  those  explored  in  their model may present future managers with windows of operational, educational, or marketing  opportunity  that  improve  competitive position or streamline the transfer of knowledge. The dissemination of this knowledge in the most efficient and effective manner is also important, for, as  Mintzberg  (1975)  points out, '[T]he  manager  is  challenged  to  find systematic ways  to share his privileged knowledge.'\n\nSince 1985, very little, if any, analytic empirical research has been done on operational aspects  of  housekeeping  and  other  laborintensive  hotel  departments. Until  there  is, there will be little forward movement in the theory of housekeeping. Inspired practical experimentation  on  the  part  of  housekeeping managers, however, is not lacking.\n\nWhen he started his career in hotel management, Kurt Englund, like the housekeepers  referenced  at  the  start  of  this  section, never expected that housekeeping would be a major stop on his career journey. It was, however, and he feels the many tasks involved in keeping  the  house  for  a  major  asset  like  a Four Seasons property prepared him well to be  the  resort  manager  at  the  Four  Seasons Resort Costa Rica at Peninsula Papagayo. He was previously the director of rooms for the luxury hotel, Regent Beverly Wilshire. In this\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nview of a day in his life, it is important to note that housekeeping is still one of his important responsibilities.\n\nProfessor Tom Jones of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, describes how housekeeping  departments  are  organized  and  staffed. He provides an overview and organizational perspective of the department, paying particular  attention  to  the  responsibilities  of  the various personnel within the modern housekeeping  department. Professor  Jones  brings deep  knowledge  of  executive  housekeeping management to his writing and structures his description  of  the  organization  with  a  realworld, tell-it-like-it-is narrative.\n\nAs John Lagazo states in the introduction to  his  description  of  being  an  executive housekeeper, most  people  are  surprised  to learn  that  housekeeping  is  an  important  career stop for hotel managers. Now the director  of  operations  at  the  luxurious  Madison Hotel in Washington, D.C., Lagazo still deals with  housekeeping  every  day, although  it  is now one of his direct reports. John wrote this piece for the third edition, but it holds up so well, I  am  including  it  here  because  he  captures the essence of the job of managing this complex organizational element.\n\nIn  most  cases, the  management  of  the housekeeping  function  is  no  longer  the province of the lead maid type. Increasingly, the expense of running the department coupled with the large numbers of employees on its  staff  mandates  that  the  head  of  this  department  be  well  versed  in  all  managerial skills and a sophisticated and creative leader.\n\n",

Housekeeping, security for the hotel and its guests, and the maintenance of the hotel's engineering  systems  are  under  the  best  of  circumstances  behind  the  scenes  and  neither noticed nor experienced by guests in any but an abstract sense. They are, nonetheless, services that are critical to a safe, comfortableand, by extrapolation, successful-guest stay at your hotel.\n\nAs stated in the first of the two articles included  here  on  the  engineering  function, in the past, the chief engineer and his or her department have been metaphorically relegated to roughly the same position in the hotel's organization that they physically occupy-usually  the  basement  or  otherwise  out  of  sight. These two articles explore the numerous indications that the importance of the engineering  function  can  no  longer  be  ignored  or treated with less respect than any other aspect of management.\n\nIt  is  important that the reader recognize that  the  first  of  these  articles  overviews  the department, explores some of the issues that affect hotel engineering, and outlines typical job functions. Part of the thrust of this article is that unlike in the past, the chief engineer is responsible for major components of the asset and the physical comfort of the guest. This argues for consideration of the chief engineer as  no  different  than  any  other  hotel  department head.\n\nThe  DeFranco  and  Sheridan  article  on how chief engineers (CEs) use financial information illustrates that idea. As their research demonstrates, computer  technology  and  the use of financial information in the engineering department are vital in maintaining an efficient  operation. This  was  not  widely  true even ten years ago. This research contributes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto the argument that, like that of the executive  housekeeper, the  position  of  CE  in  the modern hotel organization mandates a leader who is more manager/leader than technician. At the same time, the CE still must manage a diverse collection of talents and skills among the engineering staff. In a fashion, this raises the question of what type of manager such a person is. Structured research is still sparse on this topic.\n\nThe number of employees for which the CE is responsible varies widely, mainly with the size of the hotel. A 1986 study (Fisher) set the  ratio  for  an  engineering  staff  at  3.9  for each 100 rooms, but a lot has changed since then. Other factors that can influence the diversity of human-related management for the engineering manager are market niche, sophis-tication  of  the  building's  design  and equipment, and corporate philosophy. Therefore, if a 1,000-room hotel has 40 or more people  on  the  engineering  staff, each  of  them presumably  highly  trained, qualified, and skilled technical people, the CE's job takes on aspects of management that strongly suggest a need for refined people-related skills.\n\nWhen  Wasmuth  and  Davis  studied  the management  of  employee  turnover, they found  it  to  be  relatively  low  in  engineering departments  in  the  majority  of  the  hotels studied.They also found that quality of supervision was a key element in maintaining low turnover  rates  among  these  engineering  departments. The  most  successful  supervisory style had as a critical element the talent that 'allowed and encouraged (the engineers) to work autonomously' (1983, 68).\n\nAllowing  the  engineering  staff  to  work autonomously pays tribute to both the nature of their jobs and concern for the human side of  management. It  also  suggests  that  while some supervisory or management styles may\n\nbe  appropriate  in  engineering  departments, others may not. Managerial style refers to the way managers manage, control, motivate, and otherwise  direct  subordinates. It  is  through managerial style that employees may or may not  be  encouraged  and  allowed  to  work  on their own.The extent to which an atmosphere is  fostered  by  the  manager  significantly  affects  the  range  with  a  manager's  humanrelated  challenges, of  which  turnover  is  a prime example.\n\nAn unpublished, proprietary study of 49 hotel CEs with one hotel company sought to determine their managerial styles. They were asked to take a standardized managerial-style inventory  and  fill  out  a  short  demographic questionnaire  in  order  to  determine  what managerial  style  predominates  among  the self-described successful chief engineers in a major international hotel corporation.\n\nThis inventory instrument judges primary managerial style to be in one of six categories (see below), with a secondary or backup style that is one or a combination of the others.\n\n",

Primary is the managerial behavior one uses most often, is most  comfortable  with, and  is  the  style  to which  one  normally turns under  stress. Backup refers to an alternative way of managing one uses when the primary style is ineffective. Some  individuals  have  more  than one primary style, and some utilize multiple backups.\n\nThe comparisons showed that each group of CEs is primarily affiliative in style, a trait that  flies  in  the  face  of  their  reputation  as crusty curmudgeons.\n\nWith affiliative as the primary style of this group of engineers, it was somewhat surprising  that  the  backup  style  was  democratic. Combining the democratic backup style with the  predominant  affiliative  style  would  certainly produce an organizational atmosphere where the employees would feel encouraged to be independent and autonomous.\n\nThe  data  developed  through  application of this instrument to this sample of CEs tends to support the theory that successful CEs and their  departments  favor  management  styles that put people first.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I t is an unfortunate fact of modern hotel management  that  the  days  of  simply  providing comfort, high-quality  food, beverage  and lodging  services, and  a  home-away-fromhome  atmosphere  are  severely  affected  by the  inventory  of  problems  presented  by  the predatory elements of modern society. At the same time, hotel security departments are responsible  for  protecting  the  hotel's  assets from loss.\n\nHotels  are  usually  fairly  close-mouthed about their security and its functions, duties, and personnel. On an individual basis, a good overview of security can be found in publications  of  the  Educational  Institute  of  the American  Hotel  and  Motel  Association (http://www.ei-ahla.org/). Typically, however, the  modern hotel security department is organized as a staff function, with the director of security reporting directly to top management. We have little data or insight about the manager  of  the  hotel  security  function, as little, if  any, research  has  been  done  on  the subject. Anecdotally, from the editor's experience, most of the managers recently hired to fulfill this function  have  a  security  background in the military or a law enforcement career with civil authorities.\n\nTypically, the  director  of  security  has  a staff in keeping with the nature and size of the threats  to  a  particular  hotel, the  size  of  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhotel, its location, and its managerial strategy. A director  of  security  administers  the  functions  of  his  or  her  department  against  two broad  and  general  classifications  of  threats: external and internal.\n\nExternal threats are generally those that present risk for the hotel and its guests due to the actions of outsiders. Internal security is a functional  area  that  generally  is  concerned with  reducing  the  threat  of  loss  of  assets; in most cases, this refers to control of highly attractive and popular consumer goods such as wine, expensive foodstuffs, furnishings, and, of course, the hotel's cash.\n\nThe responsibilities of the security manager in contending with the above threats include the following:\n\nSecurity  directors  participate  in  certain levels of administrative or operational activities  that  deal  with  policies, training, education, and  human  resources  to  avoid  hiring what has become known as the high-risk employee. This is due primarily to the increasing risk  hotels  and  other  employers  face  from negligent hiring.\n\nHaving policies  and  procedures  in  place to deal with the management of emergencies is also a fundamental aspect of the hotel security director's job.These emergencies can take a number of forms; in recent years they have been  known  to  include  fires, hurricanes,\n\nfloods, earthquakes, blackouts, robberies, bombs or  bomb  threats, medical  and  dental emergencies, and some forms of terrorism. It is a fact of modern life that the properly managed  hotel, from  a  security  standpoint  must have contingency plans in place and training programs  to  help  its  employees  deal  with these potential threats.\n\nA further responsibility of the security director is liaison with civil authorities. Increasingly, as the article included here points out, hotels  are  being  held  accountable  for  what they either knew or should have known about potential threats. The best way to keep up on this is by cultivating a good relationship with the local police.\n\nFinally, the major responsibility of a modern hotel security director is to assist in policy development. Hotels must have policies that guide  the  implementation  of  procedures, training, and inspection to meet the inventory of potential risk. Hotels also must gather data to  make sure they are aware of all facets of the  risk  environment. The  security  function must  also  assist  the  hotel  in  formalizing  a structure that links all pertinent parts of the hotel's organization to the concept of total security for the organization, its employees, and its guests.\n\nIn  the  legal  analysis  contributed  to  this edition, Melissa Dallas outlines and discusses the  major  families  of  risk  facing  hotel  managers. She also includes in her analysis current examples of how the law affects the management of hotels in the modern era. This comprehensive and detailed article has a conversational and engaging style unusual in legal treatises.\n\nIn the article included here by Abbott and Fried, the authors explore in some depth one of the trickiest risk environments that (liter-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nally)  surround  many  hospitality  operations: the parking lot. Because parking lots can be remote, poorly lighted, or not patrolled, they are increasingly sources of risk. Courts are increasingly finding that landlords have liability for third-party criminal activity, so operators are  advised  to  be  aware  of  this  potential liability.\n\nAs  if  that  were  not  enough  to  give  one pause, the  article  by  Beattie  and  Gau  serves notice that there is yet another realm of risk that now affects our ability to manage hotels safely. Workplace  violence-including  homicide-is a growing problem for hospitality operations. The authors explore telling examples and discuss a structural theory to guide further research and the establishment of policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "Kurt Englund\n\nA day  in  the  life  with  Four  Seasons  Hotels and  Resorts  focuses  on  people, both  guests and employees. One of the first things I do in the morning is walk around the departments that are my responsibility: front desk, concierge, communications, valet  parking, door attendants, bell desk, health spa, housekeeping, laundry, and valet. It is important to be visible with the staff we depend on to provide  a  superior  level  of  service  to  all  of  our guests. Knowing who they are and what they are facing each day makes a big difference in how they carry out their job.\n\nEvery  morning, we  have  an  operational meeting to review how we are going to take\n\ncare of our guests, the other key component in  hospitality. This  meeting  is  attended  by  a wide range of managers: the general manager, hotel manager, all of the planning committee (including the director of human resources), housekeeping, conferences  services, sales managers, and catering managers. The entire day is laid out, reviewing the expected arrivals for  the  day  from  the VIPs  to  return  guests, guests  with  pets, guests  with  special  dietary requirements or mattress firmness.We discuss these to ensure the requirements are met in advance. We also include in the discussion all catering  functions  and  any  other  movement of individuals en masse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn our effort to provide a high-quality experience, we  also  discuss  any  glitch  or  poor experience any of our guests may have experienced. Our  concern  is  not  whose  fault  the glitch  was  but  rather  how  can  we  make  the stay better for our guest and prevent it from happening to any of our other guests. If the city  decides  to  jack  hammer  at  8:30  in  the morning on a Saturday, it may not be directly our  fault, but  it  is  certainly  our  guests  who have been inconvenienced.We will do a followup with the guest to explain what we know, offer a new room if appropriate, and ascertain their overall happiness with their visit.\n\nWe have a number of other meetings to keep  the  communication  going. Our  weekly meetings include planning committee, group resume, and  rooms  division. Every  other week we hold a department head meeting.\n\nAs  mentioned, we  hold  the  care  of  our employees to be as important as taking care of our guests. One of the ways we do this is by being prepared to work alongside them when business levels suddenly peak.We do our best to  staff  at  appropriate  levels, but  sometimes everything hits at once.We call these crunches and respond with an all-page for assistance to the area in need.The management response is incredible; from  our  general  manager  on down,we get the assistance we need to help in valet  parking, bell  desk, front  desk, room\n\nservice, and so on. This is an excellent example of the teamwork at our hotel making an impact on the morale of the staff.\n\nWalking around the hotel and checking in with  staff  is an  important  communication tool. Employees develop a comfort level for raising concerns about their jobs. It is equivalent to bringing the open-door policy to employees in their work area. Issues have been brought to my attention in this format such as conflicts with coworkers, questions about paychecks, suggestions to improve a work procedure, and requests for assistance in following up with maintenance concerns.\n\nHiring new staff is another crucial role in day-to-day  activities. Our  interviewing  process involves a screening by HR, an interview with the department head, an interview with the division head, and final approval from a meeting  with  the  hotel  manager  or  general manager. We attempt to be as flexible as possible when it comes to making time to interview these candidates. If the right candidate comes through the door, we make every effort to free our schedule so we can keep the interview process moving.\n\nBalancing  the  needs  of  our  guests  and employees requires flexibility.There is no typical  day  in  our  business, which  is  one  of  the reasons I enjoy my job. I face a new challenge every day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "B y  definition, hospitality is  the  cordial  and generous  reception  and  entertainment  of guests or strangers, either socially or commercially. From this definition we get the feeling of  the  open  house  and  the  host  with  open arms, of a place where people are cared for. Regardless  of  the  reasons  people  go  to  a home  away  from  home, the  presumption  is that  they  need  to  be  cared  for  there. They need a clean and comfortable place to rest or sleep, food service, an area for socializing and meeting  other  people, access  to  stores  and shops, and a secure surrounding.\n\nAmericans have often been described as a people on the move, a mobile society. Even as  our  country  expanded, we  required  bed and board. Travelers in the early 1700s found hospitality similar to that in their countries of origin, even  though  these  new  accommodations  might  have  been  in  roadhouses, missions, or private homes, and the housekeeping might have included no more than a bed of straw, changed weekly.\n\nFacilities  in  all  parts  of  young  America were commensurate with the demand of the traveling  public, and  early  records  indicate that a choice was usually available; travelers based the decision on where they expected to find  good  food, overnight  protection, and clean  facilities. Even  though  the  inns  were\n\ncrude, they were gathering places where anyone could learn the news of the day, socialize, learn the business of the area, and rest.\n\nThe  business  of  innkeeping  has  become the  hotel  industry  of  today, but  the  main tenets remain: a clean, comfortable room, access to food and entertainment facilities, and a courteous and concerned staff who mean it when they ask, 'May we be of service?'\n\nHousekeeping  departments  play  a  vital role  in  today's  lodging  industry. People  involved  in  housekeeping  operations  service guest rooms, maintain and service public and special areas, and, in many instances, operate laundries  and  recreational  and  health  facilities. The  people  of  housekeeping  are  also  a part of the overall team of hosts and hostesses who  welcome  the  hotel's  guests. They  show concern and care when something goes wrong with the guest's visit, and they are quick to initiate action that will make things right again.\n\nMajor hotel companies have been quick to  recognize  the  value  of  housekeeping  and other  service  industry  workers. Good  hotel management  does  not  see  housekeeping work  as  demeaning  or  menial. To  the  contrary, all high-quality hotel operational management  personnel  have, at one  time  or another, performed  housekeeping  functions; as  a  result, they  understand  the  worth  and value of the people who perform such functions regularly.\n\nStudents of the service industry should remember the statement made proudly by one\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof  America's  most  prestigious  resorts, The Greenbriar of White Sulfur Springs,West Virginia. This statement appears on a sign that is visible  as  one  enters  the  resort: 'Ladies  and Gentlemen  Being  Served  by  Ladies  and Gentlemen.'\n\n",

The department manager is usually called the resident manager, although the title is somewhat misleading in its implication that this manager lives on the premises; most do  not. Synonymous  titles  include  rooms manager, rooms  director, director  of  rooms operations, and, simply, hotel manager (not to be confused with the general manager).\n\nThe rooms department is usually a combination  of  two  principal  operating  departments: the front office and the housekeeping department. The  manager  in  charge  of  the front office oversees several subdepartments: reservations, front desk, bell staff, PBX, transportation, possibly  concierge, and  any  other form of guest reception function.\n\nThe manager in charge of housekeeping functions is most commonly known as the executive housekeeper. Depending on the size of the  hotel, subdepartments  within  the housekeeping  sphere  of  operations  (e.g., inhouse  laundry, recreation  department), and, in some cases, corporate policy, the person in charge of housekeeping may have any one of\n\na number of titles, all considered synonymous with executive housekeeper. A few such titles are:\n\nFor the purposes of this article we refer to this manager as the executive housekeeper.\n\nThere  was  a  time  when  most  executive housekeepers worked under the direction of the front office manager. They were, in fact, not  executives  but  people  who  had  worked their way up from a maid's position, with little or  no  managerial  training. Today, however, the size, cost, and complexity of housekeeping operations  have  put  the  executive  housekeeper on an equal footing with other department managers. As a result, executive housekeepers are now seen as sharing equally in responsibility under the resident manager for the operation of rooms departments.\n\nThe  hotel  industry  is  a  highly  laborintensive  hospitality  business. More  total employees may be involved in food and beverage (F&B) operations than in any other department. Because  of  the  diversity  of  F&B operations  (restaurants, lounges, banquet services, and  kitchen), there  are  plenty  of managers  to  control  the  total  operation. In housekeeping, however, a single department head (the executive housekeeper) is responsible for the largest staff, operating cost center, and physical area of the property.\n\nToday's  modern  executive  housekeeper must  be  a  trained  manager  skilled  in  planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and  controlling  operations. He  or  she  must  also  be skilled  in  employee  and  human  relations,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhave  a  superior  understanding  of  cost  controls, and have a strong technical background in purchasing, decorating, and  renovation. Last but not least, the executive housekeeper must be an able delegator. Without strong expertise  and  the  inclination  to  pass  tasks  to others, convey  the  necessary  power  to  act, and, finally, hold others accountable for their actions, the executive housekeeper must personally  perform  all  working  functions.

The number of floor supervisors or team leaders and workers depends on the number  of  rooms  a  room  attendant  is  expected to clean in a given eight-hour period. The national standard for rooms cleaned by one room attendant in one eight-hour period varies from 13 to 20, depending on the market mix. Hotels occupied primarily by traveling or group business transient guests are more efficient to clean because occupancy is primarily single, and such guests are up and out of their rooms early each day. Also, they are inclined to leave their rooms fairly neat. For this segment, room attendants can clean from 18 to 20  rooms  per  day. When  the  mix  features more double occupancy with families on vacation, access  to  rooms  for  cleaning  is  more difficult and  cuts into the efficiency of staffing. In  such  cases, room  attendants  are not able to clean as many rooms in the same eight-hour period.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "For our model hotel of 350 rooms, assume an 18-room workload per day. On any 100 percent occupancy day we would need approximately 20 room attendants to clean all guest rooms. Placing  these  room  attendants  in teams of five, each working under one floor supervisor, creates  a  need  for  four  supervisors. Also  assume  that  one  section  housekeeping  aide  is  assigned  to  each  team  to handle  corridor  cleaning, provide  certain services  to  room  attendants  during  the  day, and to care for other public areas within the\n\nguest  room  portion  of  the  hotel. Finally, assume that five laundry workers are needed in the laundry regularly, and that persons hired to  relieve  room  attendants  on  days  off  can also relieve in the laundry.\n\nThe  complete  organization  should  now come  into  focus, except  for  one  remaining concern. Hourly personnel cannot work seven days a week but are usually confined to a fiveworkday schedule. The following formula can establish  the  entire  rooms  cleaning, laundry, and  relief  staff  requirement; increasing  the staff allows for days off for regular room attendants, laundry  workers, floor  supervisors, and  section  housekeeping  aides. (See  the staffing guide, discussed below.)\n\nAt 100 percent occupancy on a continuous basis:\n\nregular staff × seven days =\n\ntotal staff × five day maximum\n\nS1 × 7 = S2 × 5\n\nS2 = S1 × 7 ÷ 5\n\nFor the model, S2 = 25 × 7 ÷ 5 = 35 total working staff, all limited to a five-day workweek. The  additional  ten  employees  can  be organized into two special teams identical in composition  to  the  regular  teams  and  the laundry workforce. These swing teams relieve all regular and laundry personnel teams twice each week and have two days off themselves. This portion of the organization can now be scheduled to work by team units rather than as individual workers, which greatly simplifies personnel  scheduling. (For  further  information  on  scheduling  techniques, the  reader  is encouraged to read the basic text from which this article is drawn.)\n\nThe balance of the housekeeping organization  is  noted  in  the  functions  to  be  per-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 5.1 Department Staffing Guide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 5.1 (Continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nformed, and for purposes of illustration must be  scheduled  individually. Specifically, personnel required for the second shift, persons required to staff the linen room housekeeping communications  central, and  personnel  organized under the senior housekeeping aide for  public  area  cleaning  and  maintenance round out the total department staff.\n\nThe entire housekeeping department staff might then take on the appearance provided in the staffing guide outlined in Table 5.1.\n\nThe staffing guide is created to accurately document the need for total personnel. Every position  within  the  department  is  listed  and can be used to fill vacancies when they occur. Note teams identified by color.\n\nThis  identification  system  shows  which teams are regular teams, the one that works in the  laundry, and  which  ones  are  considered swing  teams. This  particular  staffing  guide presumes  that  a  100  percent  staff  has  been hired  to  support  an  occupancy  averaging  85 percent  or  more  for  an  extended  period. Should  occupancies  be  forecast  as  a  lesser amount, a 100 percent staff need not be hired, and staff vacancies can be distributed over the entire team network. Fluctuations in daily occupancy  are  dealt  with  by  scheduling  down within each team on a fair and equitable basis. This task can be delegated to the floor supervisor, but  controls  must  be  in  place  that guarantee fairness to all who must be cut out of a day's work due to low occupancy.\n\n",

The  movement  of  management personnel between venues is well documented. When asked how difficult it is for a manager to make the transition in either direction, a member in hospital service once remarked, 'The main function of housekeeping in both areas is to clean rooms and public areas, and to dispose of trash and rubbish.There\n\nis  only  one  major  difference, however, and that is in hospitals, we know exactly what we are walking into, and in hotels, we don't know what  we  may  be  dealing  with.' That  was true-until the advent of the AIDS crisis.\n\nOn December 2,1991, new rules issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) made it mandatory that employers provide to all employees who might, as a result of their job classification, come in contact with human blood or other bodily fluids, information, training, and  compliance with federal precautions designed to maintain a  safe  workplace  with  regard  to  bloodborne pathogens  (microorganisms  that  can  cause disease in humans), especially the HIV virus and the HBV (Hepatitis B) virus.\n\nSpecifically, department  managers  must establish control plans to combat the threat and  provide  access  for  employees  to  read and understand the OSHA compliance standard. Employees such as housekeeping and laundry personnel, who as a part of their regular  daily  assigned  duties  come  in  contact with bodily fluids such as blood, semen, sputum, and  vomit  and  with  spent  needles (sharps) discarded by diabetics or drug users, must  be  advised  of  the  potential  dangers. Furthermore, they  must  be  trained  and tested in how to handle such risks when they occur, and they must be offered the opportunity to be inoculated against the HBV virus at company expense. Records must be kept of all training conducted and of all exposures that occur.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

I  thought  it would  be  quite  easy-go  through  the  management training program, become an assistant department head for a little while, move to  department  and  then  division  head, then presto-general manager!\n\nAfter  going  through  the  management training  in  my  first  company, I decided  I wanted to stay in the rooms division-more specifically  front  office, so  the  path  was  laid out: hotel assistant manager, then front office manager, brief exposure in either housekeeping  or  reservations, then  so  on  and  so  on. Never  did  I  think  I  would  be  the  executive housekeeper in arguably what are some of the finest  hotels  and  resorts  not  only  in  the United States but even the world.\n\nWhy housekeeping? When my friends ask what I do and I say, 'I'm an executive house-\n\nkeeper,' the  first  response  is, 'Oh, so  you clean rooms?' Depending on who is asking, I either  agree  or  say  it  is  much, much, more. Over the years, I  have  had  trainees  or  firsttime assistant managers who say that housekeeping was never their initial choice, but by the time they were done, they had a different appreciation for the department.\n\nSo  what  is  housekeeping?  Is  managing housekeeping just making sure the room attendants clean all the rooms every day? It is actually just a little more than that.\n\nIt  is  managing  what  usually  is  the  largest regular staff in the hotel and the budget to pay them. It is managing supplies-whatever is in the room for the guests to use and whatever is used  to  clean  anything  and  everything  in  the hotel, from the sidewalks to the staff areas (e.g., locker rooms, cafeteria, offices), from meeting spaces  to  food  and  beverage  outlets-not  to mention the guest rooms themselves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt  is  managing teamwork and coordinating with all other departments in the hotelto  make  sure  the  rooms  are  ready  for  the guests when they arrive. It is making sure that all  instructions  and  requests  from  sales  are carried out. Accounting must be satisfied that we are in control of dollars. It is making sure the food and beverage outlets are as clean as the guest rooms. It is making sure all of the human  resource  reporting  requirements  are met.\n\nFor  the  hotels  that  have  a  full-service laundry, it  is  managing  that  too-and  if  the hotel  utilizes  an  off-property  service  (for laundry, overnight  cleaning  of  the  kitchens and  public  areas, uniform  and  guest  clothes cleaning), the  executive  housekeeper  must manage that operation as well! Even though off-property services are their own business, they represent the hotel; if they do not clean the linens well or are not efficient, it costs the hotel money.\n\nExecutive  housekeepers  must  be  detailoriented  and  organized. Housekeeping  is  a 24/7 department, and it can get out of control very quickly. This means phone calls at home at  11:00  P.M. saying  that  your  staff  has  not shown  up  or  that  because  the  boilers  are down, there is no steam for the laundry. The wildest calls I received (not too often, thank goodness) were when I worked in Hawaii. Because  of  the  staffing  challenges, I  had  room attendants  and  housepersons  ferried  over from a neighboring island. If the weather was bad  or  the  boat  had  a  mechanical  problem, the phone rang around 4:00 A.M. to tell me so. I  then had to figure out Plan B for cleaning rooms and the rest of the hotel that day.\n\nGetting  away  from  the  technical  side  of things, being an executive housekeeper taught me a lot  about  managing  people; I  was 'diversity managing' well before it became po-\n\nlitically correct and one of the new management buzzwords. The staff is usually the most ethnically  diverse, with  an  accompanying challenge  being  the  level  of  English  competency and overall education.These staff members  are  asked  to  work  with  hazardous chemicals in an environment with a high accident  potential; they  push  and  pull  heavy weights, are  exposed  to  bacteria, and  work with dangerous equipment such as sheet and towel  folders  and  garbage  and  cardboard compactors.\n\nThese people have one of the most detailoriented jobs-a room checklist can have as many as 150 items that must be completed to proper standard.\n\nContrary  to  popular  belief, this  staff should also have high guest contact skills. Just because  room  attendants  and  other  housekeeping  staff  members  do  not  interact  with guests  every  time  they  perform  their  duties, this does not mean they should not be skilled in guest contact. One of my former room attendants consistently told me the travel plans of one of the regular CEOs that stayed with us. She wrote down his travel dates and let us know if his wife would be with him. Because he was such a regular, we rarely had problems in accommodating him even if we were sold out, and he always had the same room with the same room attendant.\n\nIn many of the hotels, the challenge was to pull the ethnic groups together to work as a team. Housekeeping gave me a great chance to learn about different cultures-I probably would still not know what a quincinera is (a Sweet  15  birthday/debut  in  Latin  American countries). I have eaten foods that I probably would not have otherwise and have picked up smatterings of many languages (Spanish, Creole, Tongan, Polish, Cantonese, Filipino)which, depending on the situation, can either\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nget me in serious trouble or give everyone a good laugh.\n\nI  learned  about  management  styles  and group dynamics, and I advise all of you who read  this  to  learn  as  much  about  these  subjects  as  possible. I  learned  about  identifying the informal leaders of groups and how to influence them. I learned about individual personality styles, how to manage them, and how to  get  them  to  work  together  to  get  things done. From the people of different cultures I have worked with, I learned about the ones who avoid eye contact when you speak with them, I learned about the ones that had Old Country traditions-for instance, not respecting a female or young boss-and how to turn them around.\n\nHousekeeping taught me how to adaptwhich, on the outside, should not have been an issue because I was the boss and the staff should do as I say (traditional management). Managing  people  continues  to  change  and evolve-first  there  was  Total  Quality  Management, then  Generation  X  management, and now whatever new theories are out there. To me, the bottom line is that to be a success, you must manage not only yourself but also groups of people. Manage and lead the environment (department), and you will be successful  in  your  endeavors. Get  exposure  to different environments-work in city and remote resort locations-and know and understand that everywhere you go, the guest and staff  makeup  is  different. If  you  are  adaptable, you will also be successful.\n\nThere  are  some  other  interesting  things too-for  example, when  I  shop  for  home cleaning items, I know way more than I need to. Don't  bother  listening  to  commercials; send  me  an  email  or  work  in  housekeeping and you will know why I will not buy 'window cleaner  with  ammonia.' Having  managed\n\nlaundry operations, I shop for clothes not only for style but for materials used and construction of the item. If you buy an item with lots of extra frills, beads, decoration, metallic buttons, and  bring  it  to  my  dry  cleaning  store, don't  be  surprised  if  I  charge  you  extra  for what it takes to properly clean it. I may even turn you down and say I won't clean it unless you sign a damage waiver. I now know that the  dry  cleaning  and  laundry  processes  are murder on fabrics.\n\nI have many great memories from housekeeping over the years:\n\nI  have  encountered  other  situations  too. After a suicide in a hotel room, I could only get new staff members to go into the room because  of  the  strong  superstitious  beliefs  of some  attendants. I have  managed  through both strikes and decertifications in union hotels. The celebrity stories-those alone could\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntake  up  a  whole  book. Perhaps  I  could  get rich from writing it!\n\nI  am  glad  my  career  path  has  taken  me through housekeeping. At the end of the day, it really is the memories of the people I have met  and  friends  made  over  the  years  that have  made  the  difference. I  think  I  would have learned the technical aspects one way or the  other, but  the  people  skills  have  been even more valuable. Yes, I did hold the positions of hotel assistant manager, front office assistant  manager, and  front  office  manager at various points in my career, in addition to spending  time  in  all  housekeeping  management positions, including laundry/valet manager.\n\nWhere did I get all of these memories and experiences? Since leaving my alma mater in the mid-1980s, I have been at:\n\nFrom my current perspective as director of operations of the Madison Hotel in Washington, D.C., can I say my housekeeping experience  helped  me?  You  bet!  The  varied experience with people, places, and management styles has prepared me for anything in this great hospitality business.\n\n",

      "title": "▶ Evolutionary Stimuli",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "There is now clear evidence that this department is changing in many of the same ways that  other  departments  of  a  modern  hotel have  had  to  change. The  reasons  for  these changes are many, but four can be highlighted here. Several  of  them, of  course, are  closely connected.\n\nCompetition. As  more  and  more  hotel organizations  seek  the  business  of  ever more carefully segmented markets, many of the  mechanisms  of  competition  manifest themselves  first  in  features  of  the  physical plant. These can range from building design, landscaping, elevators, and  in-room  amenities and facilities to the latest in traditional fixtures and building systems such as plumbing, kitchen  equipment, elevators, heating, ventilating  and  air  conditioning  (HVAC), and  the  other  behind-the-scenes  paraphernalia that make up the domain of the chief engineer.\n\nSophistication. Many building systems in today's hotels are interconnected, managed in conjunction with other departmental systems, and  monitored  by  computerized  facilities. This  increased  sophistication  has  mandated more sophisticated and knowledgeable man-\n\nagement in all departments, but perhaps the most drastic and substantive changes will be (and are) occurring in engineering.\n\nReturn on Investment. Many modern hotel  plants  are  the  result  of  plans  and  investments  by  a  wide  range  of  participants, including  (but  not  necessarily  always)  the management  firm  that  operates  the  hotel. These  investors  expect  a  certain  return  on their investment and subsequently expect the hotel  company  will  not  only  keep  the  hotel filled  with  guests  but  keep  the  property  in such  a  state  that  the  guests  will  continue  to want  to  come  there. This  also  mandates new  dimensions  of  the  engineer's  job. The combination of increased competition and sophisticated  systems  makes  for  more  than  a traditional repair-and-maintenance approach to providing engineering support in all areas of the hotel. To keep the hotel positively contributing  to  the  investors'  return  on  their money, the engineering staff must be considered  a  major  role  player  in  the  financial health of the organization.\n\nEnergy. The  cost, use, management, and conservation of energy have added a new and singular dimension to the job of the chief engineer-one that did not exist in pre-1973 operations, simply because energy was so cheap. Since the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, energy prices have undergone many changes, none of them  making  it  any  cheaper. Prior  to  that, buildings  were  neither  engineered  nor  managed to save energy.\n\nSince then, most hotels and most modern hotel companies have come to recognize energy as one building expense in which significant  savings  can  be  made. If  accomplished with care, engineering can provide for delivery of hotel services without adverse or negative effects on the guest.We want to avoid, for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninstance, the  extreme  step  of  requesting guests to take short showers while at the same time asking them to pay $180 a night for their room.\n\nThe  residual  effects  of  the  embargo  are twofold. Hotels built prior to 1973 were not constructed  to  be  particularly  energy  efficient. Engineers in those hotels have a more difficult job with respect to managing energy.\n\nOn the other hand, hotels that were designed  and  built  after  1973-1974  exhibit  increasingly  more  sophisticated  systems  for managing and conserving energy without adversely affecting guests.\n\nThe first instance presents the managerial problem  of  making  do  for  the  engineering manager; the second presents the dilemma of expanding  one's  knowledge  in  a  rapidly changing technological environment. It should be noted that energy remains a significant  management  issue  for  the  engineer  in the  year  2005, and  will  for  the  foreseeable future.\n\nIn no business system as complex as a hotel  is  a  mechanical  or  electronic  system  the only answer. A tremendous amount of attention  must  be  given  to  training  personnel  to overcome  wasteful  habits  where  energy  is concerned.A classic example is that of kitchen employees who turn on every appliance in the kitchen at 6:00 A.M. when maybe only 20 percent of them are used for the preparation of breakfast and most of the rest are not needed until  close  to  lunch. This  is  representative  of the sort of wasteful habit that is out of the engineer's control but that he or she is obligated to  point  out  to  other  department  heads. Clearly, the engineer now must have an active presence as a full member of the management staff  and  must  be  adept  at  interacting  with other department managers.\n\n",

Chief engineers responding to this survey describe  themselves  collectively  according  to the data set forth in Table 5.2. Over 25 percent of those responding to this nationwide survey indicated  they  have  a  university  degree. Three-quarters of those degrees were in some area of engineering. This suggests that the sophistication of modern hotel building operations  may  be  mandating  management  by those whose formal education is more extensive than that required in the past.\n\nIn this study, the typical engineer was 44.5 years old and had been in the hospitality business  about  11  years.

The  most  successful  engineers  of  the  future will  very  likely  be  those  whose  training  and education  prepares  them  to  think  strategically, to recognize trends, and do their part to help the hotel and its owners meet and deal with the evolutionary issues discussed earlier.\n\n",

      "content": "Refer  again  to  Figure  5.3. Depending, of course, on the size of the hotel and the extent and sophistication of its engineering functions, the chief engineer may enjoy the services of a staff of  administrators, including  assistant managers.These people help carry out the administrative  details  of  operating  an  increasingly  complicated  hotel  department. Related tasks  include  secretarial  support, which  may be combined with a clerical function.\n\nAmong  the  most  important  administrative functions of the engineering department are:\n\nAs  the  department  grows  in  size  and scope, a  major  administrative  function  involves  scheduling  equipment  and  personnel to  accomplish  the  tasks  of  the  department. While  scheduling  may  benefit  greatly  from technological advances such as microcomputers  or  the  hotel's  mainframe  computer  system, in a  building  whose  systems  are  as complicated and interrelated as those of a hotel, part of the engineering function must be the  ability  to  react  to  nonscheduled  events ranging from overflowing toilets to stuck elevators, gas leaks, and so forth.\n\nA final administrative function is setting the groundwork and maintaining the basis for managerial and administrative decisions that affect  the  long-term  operation  of  the  engineering department and, by extrapolation, the hotel  itself. This  involves  keeping  accurate and up-to-date records regarding the various building  systems  and  the  installation  of capital  equipment  for  which  the  engineer  is responsible.\n\nThese  sorts  of  administrative  details complicate the job of any manager but may be particularly troubling to the engineer. One of  the  main  reasons  is  that  while  the  engineering  department  is  responsible  for  the maintenance and repair of sophisticated and complicated  building  systems, under  most\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncircumstances these systems, or their components, are  often  operated  by  (and  perhaps misused by) non-engineering employees and guests. Particularly in the case of guests, the engineer has little or no control over the way in  which  they  treat  guest  room  equipment and fixtures for which the engineer is responsible. Engineers  who  have  the  luxury  of  a well-developed administrative staff find their job in managing the building and its systems and  the  attendant  problems  much  easier  if complete, accurate, and  up-to-date  records are available to formulate the basis for planning, purchasing, budgeting, and control.\n\n",

      "content": "Typical  building  functions, which  are  the  responsibility  of  the  engineering  department, are listed in Figure 5.3. Each has its own place in providing for the comfort of the guest and participating  in  the  delivery  of  the  hotel's services  to  the  guests. Each  has  attendant complications that provide challenges for the management  and  staff  of  the  engineering department.\n\nHeating, ventilating, and air conditioning (collectively  known  as  HVAC)  is  concerned with  supplying  the  production, public, and guest  room  areas  of  the  hotel  with  a  clean, controlled, and  comfortable  indoor  environment. Modern building  HVAC systems  provide for heating or cooling the air, adding or deleting  moisture  from  the  air  to  adjust  for optimum relative humidity, filtering or cleaning the air, and moving the air from place to place within the hotel to provide for a number of complete changes of air in a room per hour, depending on local codes and activities within that particular area of the hotel.\n\nAmong the complicating factors here that\n\nchallenge  the  engineering  department  are that different areas of the hotel have different requirements  for  air. It  is  easy  to  see  that kitchens and guest rooms place different demands  on  the  HVAC  system. Lobbies  have different  requirements  than  do  other  public areas  such  as  bars, restaurants, and  housekeeping laundry facilities. Engineers call this job  of  meeting  diverse  air  needs 'providing the  system  with  balance,' and  it  is  a  major function  of  the  individuals  in  charge  of  the HVAC to deliver the optimum environment to each area of the hotel.\n\nThe plumbing system in a modern hotel must  also  perform  a  number  of  balancing functions. First  and  foremost  in  the  mind  of management, of  course, is the  delivery  of high-quality water service to guest room areas. Guests  want  high-quality  water  that  is free from visual defects such as dirt and rust, does  not  carry  odors, and  tastes  clean  and fresh. Guests  also  want  water  that  is  hot enough to shave, bathe, and wash in without the  danger  of  scalding  themselves, and  they also  want  that  water  in  generous  supply. Nothing is more frustrating to a hotel guest who is paying over $200 a night for a room to find that the hotel has run out of hot water in the middle of a morning shave or shower. At the same time, the engineering department is expected to deliver production hot and cold water to the kitchen areas, the housekeeping and laundry areas, and the food service areas. Providing for the delivery of high-quality water  service  to  the  various  user  groups  in  the hotel is a major part of the engineering function-one  that, of  course, is noticed  only when the system is malfunctioning.\n\nA similar case may be made for the delivery of electricity. The electrical systems of the hotel, like the plumbing systems, must be designed and maintained to serve various user\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngroups. Again, like plumbing, there is no substitute  for  electricity. The  engineering  staff must provide the hotel with electrical service that  meets  the  needs  of  individual  departments and the needs of guests.\n\nRefrigeration, food  production  equipment, and computer systems are examples of other building system functions for which the engineering  department  may  be  responsible for repairing, maintaining, replacing, or managing. While  the  maintenance  of  many  of these  systems  may  be  contracted  to  outside agencies such as the supplier, the engineering department nonetheless is the first line of defense in keeping them operating efficiently.\n\nIn  most  modern  hotels, the  installation and service of elevator systems are generally the  province  of  the  elevator  manufacturer, and  hotels  typically  have  extended  maintenance agreements for the elevators. Most engineering departments, however, closely monitor  the  operation  of  the  elevator  systems. In  modern  high-rise  hotels  with  highspeed elevator service, the slightest problem with that service should be quickly and easily identified and reported to the contractors. It is generally the responsibility of the engineering department to monitor these services and their contracts closely and carefully.\n\nThe crafts represented in Figure 5.3 illustrate the sorts of specialized skills required by most hotel engineering departments. Depending on the size of the hotel and complexity of its  services, an  engineering  department  may employ on a full-time basis one or more carpenters  and  cabinetmakers  to  maintain, repair, and build fixtures and furniture for the hotel's guests and staff. Similarly, if the service is  not  contracted out, hotels may employ an upholsterer whose major task is to maintain the  high-quality  appearance  of  the  vast  collection of furniture in a typical hotel.\n\nPainting, upkeep  of  the  hotel's  grounds, and landscaping are additional ongoing functions  that  require  constant  attention. These services  may  be  contracted  to  outside  agencies or suppliers but are included here to suggest  the  range  of  functions  for  which  the engineering department is responsible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Energy  cost  alone  runs  anywhere from 4 to 6 percent of a property's total operation  budget. Savings  in  energy  cost  can  be accomplished by instituting simple steps such as  modifying staff  members' behavior (Dale and Kluga, 1992). How can financial data be used  to  continuously  improve  the  performance of the engineering department? To an-\n\nswer this question, a survey was performed to collect  data  from  hotel  engineers  to  determine their use of financial information. It is postulated that if financial information is analyzed correctly, the engineering department can  serve  its  profit  centers  better, which  in turn will assist these profit centers in reducing both their cycle time and errors.\n\nA number of studies have been done on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe use of financial information by managers in profit centers of hotels, but not many were performed specifically to collect information regarding the engineering department. Malk and  Schmidgall  (1995)  discuss  the  use  of  financial  statements  and  information  in  the food and beverage department of a hotel, particularly  in  an  effort  to  contain  costs  and maintain  a  profit. Turkel  (1993)  also  advocates the development of profit and loss statements and allocating costs properly to ascertain the profitability of a food and beverage  department. Malk  and  Schmidgall (1994) also investigate the cost percentages in the  rooms  division  to  help  rooms  division managers  with  cost containment. Quain (1992) explores the use of profit analysis by the  customer  segment  in  addition  to  yield management, and  the  topic  of  menu  engineering to improve profits in food and beverage  establishments  has  also  been  discussed (Bayou  and  Bennett, 1992; Dougan, 1994). However,few,if any, studies can be quoted for the engineering department.\n\n",

Hotel engineers were also interviewed to see how their use of financial information  could  improve  quality  in  their departments by reducing cycle time and eliminating errors.\n\nThe population for this study consisted of directors  of  engineering  in  U.S. hotels  that\n\nwere  listed  in  the Hotel  and  Travel  Index, Spring  1994  edition. The  sample  was  randomly selected from this index, and the selection  criteria  were  based  on  the  number  of rooms in the property. The sample hotels all had 200 or more rooms. It was believed that hotels of this size would probably have an engineering  department. The  sample  size  was 400 hotels, and the sample hotels were located throughout the 50 states.\n\nFor the first mail-out, a cover letter and a questionnaire were sent to the general manager of each sample hotel. It was felt that if the  surveys  were  addressed  to  the  general managers by name, they would be more likely to read the surveys and pass them along to the directors of engineering. The initial response rate, however, was only 15 percent. In order to improve the response rate, three weeks after the  initial  mail-out, a  second  mail-out  was sent. The  second  mail-out  was  addressed specifically  to  the  director  of  engineering. Follow-up  letters  and  questionnaires  were sent to the entire sample. A total of 97 of the 400 questionnaires were eventually returned for a response rate of 24.25 percent.\n\n",

      "content": "I t was apparent that managers of engineering departments recognized the importance of financial  information. They  worked  together\n\nwith  the  accounting  department  to  compile budgets, actual statements, and  variance analyses, which  were  then  used  to  evaluate the performance and success of the engineering  department. Computer  technology  was common in their operations.\n\nHowever, improvements  can  always  be made  to  achieve  zero  defects, reduce  cycle time, and  enhance  employee  empowerment. As noted, 'improve motivation of my staff' and 'improve communication with my staff' were rated as the bottom two of the ten criteria  given. In  addition, two  was  the  average number of people involved in the preparation of these reports. If it is not practical to have more  employees  share  in  the  compilation process, the least an engineering department can do is to have more employees participate in the analysis process.When more employees are involved, motivation and communication tend to increase.This positive attitude may be passed along to other employees and guests.\n\nAsking  employees  to  be  involved  does not mean they must do the accounting work. Rather, those  who  compile  the  information can  share  with  other  staff  members  the  importance of cost control and how cost savings in the engineering area can affect the bottom line, which may ultimately affect their job performance and bonuses. These discussions can be in the form of employee meetings where employees  may  make  suggestions  for  improvements. Because  employees  encounter day-to-day problems and situations that managers may not be aware of, they may be able to  offer  comments  and  suggestions  that  address  concerns  such  as  staffing, cost  control, and physical plant improvements. This process  may  help  the  entire  department  become more innovative and further empower engineering  employees, reduce  cycle  time, and, possibly, eliminate errors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe majority of respondents (60 percent) used  computers  to  compile  financial  information. The rest used a combination of computers  and  manual  methods. Engineering departments that do not use a computer may find that working with one may help improve their overall efficiency.\n\nAs this study has shown, computer technology and the use of financial information in engineering department are vital in maintaining  an  efficient  operation. According  to  the\n\nNational Restaurant Association's 1994 Restaurant Industry Operations survey, utility expenses  for  restaurants  increased  6.9  percent from 1992 to 1993, while repairs and maintenance increased 5.8 percent in the same period (Riehle, 1994). If not watched, these costs will probably continue to eat away the profits. It is up to the engineering department to use restaurant financial information to help contain these costs.\n\n",

Each  of  these  is  discussed below.\n\nCommon law originated in England and, although  decisions  issued  by  courts  in  the United States have added considerably to this body  of  law, some  decisions  made  several hundreds of years ago still influence presentday judicial decisions.The primary purpose of common law is to provide stability and predictability as judges rule on cases. Judges use past decisions as a precedent for deciding current cases. This decision becomes binding for lower courts in that jurisdiction and can even be used as persuasive authority for courts in other jurisdictions faced with cases having a similar pattern of facts.\n\nConstitutional  law, of  course, is  derived from the U.S. Constitution, which protects individuals  from  government  excesses. When the Supreme Court, made up of nine justices, grants a writ of certiorari, it agrees to hear a case and then renders a decision that subsequently becomes the law of the land. On the other  hand, if  the  Court  refuses  to  issue  a writ, the  law  stands  as  decided  by  a  lower court.\n\nStatutory  law  is  made  by  local, state, or federal legislatures or other governing bodies. Federal and state laws are called statutes, and local laws are called ordinances. Legislatures can choose to modify or change common law by enacting statutes that codify, or spell out, a new law.\n\nFinally, administrative law consists of regulations passed by agencies such as the Food and  Drug  Administration  and  the  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration. Congress approves the agencies, then authorizes them to make regulations that affect businesses as well as individuals.\n\n▶\n\n",

      "title": "Classifications of Law",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Laws  generally  fall  into  one  of  three  major classifications: civil, criminal, or international. Most complaints filed against hotels are civil suits in which an individual has been wronged by  another  individual  or  by  a  corporation (which, incidentally, is a legal individual). The injured  party-the  plaintiff-files  a  lawsuit that  describes  the  facts  of  the  situation  and asks  for  damages. These  damages  may  be compensatory or punitive or both. Compensatory damages are meant to restore people to their original condition and include monetary  judgments  for  actual  damages  such  as back and future wages, medical costs, pain and suffering, and  breach  of  contract. Punitive damages, on the other hand, are awarded to punish the wrongdoer. Because punitive damages in civil suits are awarded only in the case of  violence, malice, or  fraud, they  are  relatively uncommon.\n\nMost  civil  cases  filed  against  hotels  involve claims of negligence. In order for plaintiffs  to  be  successful, they  must  prove  four elements. First, they must prove the hotel had a duty to them. Next, they must prove the hotel breached that duty. Third, they must show the breach was the reason for the incident occurring in the first place, and the hotel should have  been  able  to  foresee  injuries. Finally, they must have been injured in some way so they can collect damages.The theory of negligence  requires  a  hotel  to  act  reasonably  to prevent foreseeable injuries to guests and visitors. To illustrate this theory, assume a front office employee did not require identification when issuing duplicate keys. A person was issued a room key by this employee, then used the key to enter a guest room and injured a guest. Here, the hotel would likely be found\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnegligent because it breached its duty to keep guests safe by not practicing proper key control. The intrusion and resulting injury would not have happened but for the employee issuing a duplicate key without requesting identification, and this omission resulted in injuries to the guest.\n\nIn  order  for  someone  to  be  criminally prosecuted, on the other hand, he or she must be charged with committing a wrong against society as a whole. Crimes require intent on the part of the defendant; if found guilty, the defendant may be charged a fine, imprisoned, or both. Crimes most often affecting hotel operations  include  theft, assault, and  battery. Theft, of course, can relate to goods, services, or  both. Assault  is  defined  as  the  imminent threat of bodily harm, and battery is the actual harmful physical contact. An example of an assault is a bouncer in a nightclub wrongfully threatening a patron and running toward the patron with his arms raised. Battery is the bouncer picking up the patron and wrongfully throwing him down the steps and out the door of the club.\n\nAlthough the hotel industry is becoming increasingly  global, international  law  that  is actually enforceable against an individual or a hotel  company  is  rare. Most  international laws are in the form of treaties, while others are customary laws followed by nations over time. The primary international laws applied to hotel companies are treaties that govern intellectual  property  such  as  trademarks  and copyrights. The Paris Convention of 1883 affords its signatories (meaning citizens of the countries that signed the treaty) the right to file  for  trademark protection in any country that also signed the treaty.\n\nSuppose, for example, a hotel chain named Paradise Lodges opened in the United\n\nStates. Under the Paris Convention, the owners  could  file  for  trademark  protection  in other  countries, thereby  globally  protecting the  identity  of  Paradise  Lodges. The  Berne Convention  of  1886  gives  its  signatories  the right  to  file  for  copyright  protection  of  any original literary or artistic material. Here, suppose  a  hotel  wanted  to  prevent  other  hotel chains  from  using  its  unique  jingle  or  song that is integral to its marketing efforts. Under the Berne Convention, the hotel could safeguard its song and prevent others from using it in their advertising campaigns.\n\n",

The  only  way  to  protect  a  hotel  company from  lawsuits  is  to  practice  preventive  law. This requires management to know the common legal dangers for each department and to follow the law as closely as possible.\n\nWe must first review one other concept. Respondeat superior is a Latin term that literally means 'let the master answer.' Under the theory of respondeat superior, employers are liable  for  acts  of  their  employees  if  the  employees are at fault and were doing work for the employer at the time of the accident or incident. The  financial  implication  of respondeat superior for a hotel is obvious-the hotel pays!\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Potential costly legal situations are present in all restaurants and bars. The most commonly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlitigated areas involve food safety and alcohol service.\n\nFood  Safety. Many  laws  governing  food safety are administrative laws established by the  Food  and  Drug Administration  (FDA). 1 The FDA regulates everything from food processing 2 and  labeling 3 to  packaging. 4 Food and beverage sales are controlled by the Uniform  Commercial  Code  (UCC), which  lays out  rules  governing  the  sale  of  goods  and, specifically, requires all food and beverages to be merchantable, or fit for human consumption. 5 This  warranty  applies  whenever  and wherever food or beverages are sold. 6\n\nIn  order  to  be  protected  from  lawsuits, the  food  preparation  area  should  be  inspected  regularly  to  ensure  that  no  hazards exist. For  example, employees  should  make certain that no light bulbs or food shields are broken, as glass could easily get into the food. If a server breaks a glass in an ice bin, the bin must  be  emptied  and  carefully  cleaned  out before it is refilled with fresh ice.\n\nAdditionally, food must be properly handled to ensure its safety. E. coli, bacteria often present  in  undercooked  hamburger, can  be dangerous  or  even  deadly. 7 This  threat  has prompted some restaurants to cook all their hamburgers to 160 degrees to kill the bacteria.\n\nSalmonella, bacteria that can result in severe  diarrhea, fever, and  abdominal  cramping, is most often found in undercooked eggs, beef, and  poultry, and  can  also  be  found  in milk and vegetables. Cooking meats until all juices  run  clear  and  training  employees  to practice  good  handwashing  techniques  are imperative. Eggs pose a more difficult problem, however. In order to be perfectly safe, a restaurant would warn patrons about the possibility of salmonella before serving poached, over-easy, or  over-medium  eggs, hollandaise sauce, Caesar salad dressing, mayonnaise, and\n\ntiramisu. The  practicality  of  this  practice  is doubtful, but  perhaps  a  general  warning  on the menu would suffice.\n\nFood  and  beverages  must  be  served  at safe  temperatures  as  well. In  an  often  discussed case involving McDonald's, 8 a 79-yearold  woman, Stella  Liebeck, was  seriously burned when coffee spilled on her lap. After her  grandson  gave  her  the  coffee  he  purchased  from  the  drive-through  window, he stopped  so  Liebeck  could  add  cream  and sugar to her drink. The entire contents of the Styrofoam cup spilled on her lap, and she received third-degree burns on over 6 percent of  her  body. The  temperature  of  the  coffee was  initially  believed  to  have  been  between 180  and  190  degrees  Fahrenheit. A  McDonald's quality assurance manager testified that this  was  the  standard  serving  temperature range for the company's coffee. For the sake of  comparison, the  temperature  of  most home-brewed coffee usually reaches between 135 to 140 degrees.\n\nThe jury initially awarded Liebeck $200,000 in compensatory damages (reduced to  $160,000  as  Liebeck  was  found  to  be  20 percent at fault), and $2.7 million in punitive damages. An investigation following this verdict revealed that the actual serving temperature of the coffee was 158 degrees Fahrenheit, so  the  court  reduced  the  punitive  award  to $480,000, or three times compensatory damages. McDonald's and Liebeck then agreed to an undisclosed settlement to close the case. 9\n\nThe point here is that hotels need to serve safe  food  and  beverages  and  to  serve  food and  beverages  safely. At  the  very  least, customers should be advised of any known risks so they can decide for themselves whether to eat the food or drink the beverage. Food and beverage do not need to taste good under the UCC, but they must be safe! 10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlcohol  Service. Establishments  that serve alcohol open themselves to a different type  of  legal  danger. Dram  shop  laws  are state  statutes  that  permit  an  injured  third party  to  sue  the  establishment  that  unlawfully  served  the  alcohol. For  example, let's say a bartender at the XYZ Hotel overserved a patron. The patron then got into his car to drive  home. On  the  way  home, the  intoxicated  patron  lost  control  of  his  car  and  severely  injured  a  bicyclist. Dram  shop  laws permit the injured cyclist to sue the XYZ Hotel  for  damages. Some  states  that  have  not enacted  dram  shop  laws  permit  third-party suits  under  their  common-law  theories  of negligence.\n\nIncreased  attention  to  alcohol  problems has caused an increasing number of states to require  their  managers, servers, and  bartenders  to  be  trained  in  responsible  alcohol service. 11 Although  training  does  not  completely protect an establishment from alcoholrelated suits, it may lower punitive damages.\n\n",

      "content": "Inspection and Repair. The primary legal dangers  in  both  housekeeping and maintenance are related to negligence and involve lack of inspection and repair. Broken furniture, loose carpeting, slippery floor surfaces, potholes in parking lots, unmarked changes in elevation, snow-  and  ice-covered  walkways, and  faulty electrical  cords  can  easily  injure  guests  and visitors alike. In fact, injuries sustained from slips  and  falls  are  the  most  common type of lawsuit hotels encounter. Failure to regularly inspect rooms and public spaces for dangers may be grounds for a successful suit. Recovery  for  a  plaintiff  is  even  more  likely  if  the\n\nhotel  knew  about  a  danger  and  did  not  address it.\n\nProbably  the  most  tragic  maintenancerelated cases involve injuries or even death to children. The  attractive  nuisance  doctrine holds a property owner liable for any injuries resulting  from 'a  potentially  harmful  object so  inviting  or  interesting  to  a  child  that  it would lure the child onto the property to investigate.' 12 It  recognizes  that  children, because  of  their  age, cannot  fully  appreciate danger.\n\nLodging  facilities  with  more  than  one level  and  those  who  have  swimming  pools must  be  especially  diligent. Children  should not be able to open windows more than a few inches, and  all  balconies  must  have  railings that  are  close  together  to  prevent  accidental falls. Swimming  pools  must  be  maintained properly and accessible only with a room key. Signage around the pool area should be large and clearly  written  and  require  adults  to  accompany children at all times. Children should be entirely banned from Jacuzzis and saunas.\n\nThe best way to prevent suits in these areas is to be attentive. Both housekeepers and maintenance  workers  should  be  required  to follow  a  regular  preventive  maintenance schedule. Professionals can be hired to complete periodic safety audits of hotels.\n\nLost  and  Stolen  Guest  Property. The housekeeping staff in hotels collects an amazing array of items left behind in guest rooms. Potential  privacy  problems  arise  if  a  hotel contacts guests to notify them of articles they left behind.The better way to handle this is to transfer the items to a secured area, then hold them until the guest contacts the hotel. Many states have laws that govern the finding of lost property. Generally, if  the  owner  cannot  be found in a certain period, the property may be sold in accordance with the state statute.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStolen items pose an entirely different set of challenges. All hotels are required to provide  safes  for  guest  use. Many  hotels  now have in-room safes that must be programmed by  the  guest  and  are  reset  when  the  guest checks  out. If  guests  choose  not  to  use  the safe  and  find  some  valuables  missing  from their room, the hotel is generally not liable. 13\n\nAll  states  have  enacted  limiting  liability statues that limit a hotel's liability for guests' property losses.These statutes vary from state to state, but in all cases, a hotel must strictly comply  with  the  requirements  to  be  protected. 14 Common requirements include posting  the  availability  of  the  safe  as  well  as stating  the  maximum  amount  for  which  the hotel is liable in case of theft.\n\n",

To avoid liability, front desk agents should check area hotels for availability if they know that overbooking is likely. In the case of a civil suit for  breach  of  contract, the  would-be  guest could recover compensatory damages including payment for travel to a different hotel, the additional  cost  of  lodging, if  any, and  other costs associated with the inconvenience. 15\n\nDue to the potential legal liability and the damage  to  their  reputation  and  goodwill, some  large  hotel  chains  have  completely eliminated  the  practice  of  intentional  overbooking.

      "content": "Wrongful discharge, discrimination, and Federal Labor Standards Act claims are becoming more and more commonplace.The human resource staff handles the resolution of these types of claims and many more.\n\nWrongful Discharge. Even in states that follow an employment-at-will doctrine, which permits  an  employer  to  terminate  an  employee at any time, without cause or reason, wrongful discharge suits are relatively common. Wrongful discharge claims arise when an  employee  is  fired  for  reasons  that  are not  legitimate. These  wrongful  discharge cases  are  one  of  two  types: traditional  or constructive.\n\nTraditional  wrongful  discharge  claims arise  when  an  employee  is  unlawfully  fired. An example is firing an employee for filing a workers'  compensation  claim, assuming  the state had a statute making this discharge unlawful. Another  example  is  firing  an  employee for whistle-blowing (reporting a company's illegal activities to an official). 16\n\nConstructive  discharge  occurs  when  an employer's  actions, such  as  continual  or  severe harassment, force an employee to quit. If the hotel company is found liable, the plaintiff can receive both compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThe  wisest  strategy  for  hotels  is  to  develop a formal policy manual that details the possible  reasons  for  discharge  and  disciplinary procedures. Employees should be thoroughly  advised  of  these  policies, and  all supervisors  and  managers  should  follow  the policies as closely and systematically as possible. Finally, management  should  document, document, and document some more!\n\nDiscrimination. Discrimination  in  the workplace has not always been unlawful. In fact, not until 1964 was a federal statute enacted  that  addressed  discrimination. Since that  time, other  important  federal  statutes have been passed dealing with pregnancy, age, and disabilities. Sexual harassment suits have become commonplace recently, and they are, in effect, based on gender discrimination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 17 made it illegal  to  discriminate  against  applicants  or  employees  based  on  race, religion, color, national origin, or gender. The Act applies  to  employers with 20 or more employees, and  it  created  the  Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as its enforcement arm. 18\n\nOnly in the case of business necessity or bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) can  a  hotel  legally  discriminate. 19 Note  that the  courts  interpret  these  exceptions  quite strictly, often  resulting  in  rulings  for  the plaintiffs.\n\nThe  Pregnancy  Discrimination  Act  of 1978 20 made it illegal to discriminate against pregnant women unless the discrimination is a business necessity or not being pregnant is a BFOQ for the job. For example, a hotel could probably refuse to hire a woman who is seven months  pregnant  as  a  lifeguard  because  the pregnancy  could  affect  her  ability  to  act quickly to save lives.\n\nThe Age Discrimination Act  of  1967  was amended in 1986 21 to make it illegal to discriminate against an applicant or an employee who is 40 years old or older. Although portraying a youthful  and  energetic  image  is  important  to many hotels, it is simply illegal to discriminate against an employee who is at least 40 years old as long as that employee can perform the job better than a younger employee.\n\nThe  American with Disabilities Act (ADA)  of  1990 22 forbids discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals on the basis of a physical or mental disability. Title I of  the ADA  bans  discrimination  in  employment and applies to applicants or employees who are otherwise qualified for the position. This  means  the  applicant  or  employee  must be able to perform the essential elements of\n\nthe  job  regardless  of  the  disability. Title  III bans  discrimination  in  public  accommodations (lodging facilities, for one) and commercial facilities. The ADA requires all accommodations  to  be  reasonable 23 and  to create  no  undue  burden 24 for  the  business. The courts, on a case-by-case basis, determine what constitutes an undue burden.\n\nFinally, the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1991 25 gave  plaintiffs  claiming  discrimination  the right to a jury trial as well as possible punitive damages. The possibility of larger awards for plaintiffs has caused more employers to adopt stricter and clearer policies for selection, promotion, layoffs, and termination.\n\nBy now, most people are familiar with the plethora  of  sexual  harassment  claims  that have been filed in courts.The nature of the hotel  industry leaves hotels vulnerable to more claims  than  business  in  most  other  industries-the late and long hours of work, the privacy of hotel rooms, and the alcohol service.\n\nCourts recognize two types of sexual harassment. The  first, quid  pro  quo, literally means 'this for that.' Quid pro quo 26 claims occur  when  one  person  threatens  action against another unless he or she agrees to perform  a  sexual  act. Hostile  work  environment 27 claims are much more common. Here, the  behavior  must  be  sufficiently  severe  or pervasive, unwelcome, and not voluntary, and must affect a term, condition, or privilege of employment. Workplace  behaviors  found  to create a hostile work environment are repeatedly  sending  sexually  suggestive  letters  and notes, 28 sending  risqué  emails, 29 and  prominently  displaying  nude  pictures  (when  combined with other lewd behaviors). 30\n\nThe  best  tactic  for  management  to  employ  is  to  adopt  a  no-tolerance  policy. This policy  should  be  included  in  the  employee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhandbook and posted conspicuously throughout the hotel. Also, employees must feel free to  speak  with  more  than  one  person  in  the event of a sexual harassment complaint, because  their  supervisor  might  be  the  person who is doing the harassing.\n\nIt is important to note that states and localities can adopt even stricter laws than the federal statutes. For example, some areas prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. 31 Others  disallow  discrimination  based on marital status.\n\nFederal  Labor  Standards  Act. The  Federal Labor Standards Act 32 (FLSA) mandates minimum wages, overtime pay, and equal pay for equal work, and restricts child labor.\n\nThe  rate  of  minimum  pay  is  established by  Congress  and  applies  to  virtually  all  employers with annual sales of $500,000 more. 33 The FLSA, however, includes certain exceptions  such  as  training  wages 34 and  tip  credits. 35 Training  wages  at  85  percent  of  the minimum wage may be paid for the first 90 days to employees who are between the ages of 16 and 19 and entering the workforce for the first time. Tip credits permit employers to pay  regularly  tipped  employees, such  as servers, at a rate of pay equal to one-half of the  current  minimum  wage. However, the combination  of  tips  and  actual  wages  must equal at least the current minimum wage rate. For  example, if  the  minimum  wage  is  $6.00 and a server receives tips averaging $3.00 per hour, the hotel could pay the employee at a rate of $3.00 per hour. If a server made only $2.00 per hour in tips, the hotel would be required to pay the server at a rate of $4.00 per hour  to  raise  the  hourly  wages  to  the  minimum $6.00 required by law. Some states or localities require a minimum wage rate higher than the federal mandate.\n\nOvertime wages must be paid to nonexempt employees, meaning those who must be paid at least minimum wage, who work over 40  hours  in  one  week. These  wages  are mandated at a rate equal to 1.5 times the regular  hourly  wage  rate. 36 On the other hand, overtime  rates  need  not  be  paid  to  exempt employees. The  FLSA  defines  exempt  employees  as  those  who  spend  40  percent  or more of  their  time  performing  management functions or work for a seasonal amusement or recreational establishment. 37\n\nIt  is important  to  understand  that  the FLSA uses a weekly pay period to determine overtime. This is especially important to hotels who pay employees biweekly. For example, if an employee works 30 hours during the first week of the pay cycle and 50 hours during the second, the hotel must pay 10 hours of overtime for the extra hours worked during the second week of the cycle, even though the total  hours  worked  during  the  pay  period equaled 80.\n\nThe  equal-pay-for-equal-work  requirement  of  the  FLSA  requires  that  employers pay employees at the same rate if they perform substantially similar work that requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility. 38 Human resources must identify the core or essential elements of each position, as the courts look at these elements when comparing jobs.\n\nChild  labor  laws  affect  many  hotels, as many of the employees are young, especially during  the  summer  season. The  FLSA  requires  all  employees  to  be  at  least  14  years old. Further, the Act restricts the number of hours that teenagers under the age of 18 can work  during  a  one-week  period. During school days, 14- and 15-year-olds cannot work more than  18  hours  per  week  and  no  more than 3 hours per day. 39 Some state laws are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neven stricter than the federal ones, further restricting work hours for teenagers.\n\nViolations  of  the  FLSA  are  reported  to the U.S. or state department of labor and can be costly for hotels. If the violations are found to be intentional, employers may be fined up to $10,000 per offense. A second offense may result in imprisonment for up to six months. 40 Many states  have  even  stricter  penalties  for noncompliance.\n\n",

Regardless, every  employee  is  responsible for the security of the hotel's guests. Most jurisdictions require that lodging facilities exercise reasonable care to protect guests and  patrons  from  reasonably  foreseeable crime risks.\n\nWhen  deciding  what  preventive  actions are reasonable, courts look at certain factors to  determine if  the  hotel  was  put  on  notice. Courts consider factors such as the frequency and severity of past crimes, a recent increase in the area crime rate, and security problems posed by the facility's design. Courts also look at training and personnel activities and design modifications the hotel has undertaken in the effort to keep its guests safe.\n\nThe most common areas in which crimes are committed against guests are guest rooms and  immediately  outside  of  the  property. While  proper  key  control  is  vital  to  guest room safety, so is the regular inspection of hotel  room  doors  and  locks. In  a  highly  publicized case, singer Connie Francis was raped at gunpoint  by  a  man  who  entered  her  room\n\nthrough  a  sliding  glass  door  that  was  easily unlocked from the outside. Francis recovered $2.5 million. 41\n\nCrimes  can  also  occur  in  hotel  parking lots. Low lighting levels support an ideal environment  for  crimes. If  the  hotel  is  put  on warning  of  criminal  activity, meaning  it  is aware of crimes that occurred on the property or in the immediate neighborhood, it should take further security precautions. These precautions might include hiring additional personnel, installing  more  lights, constructing  a fence  around  the  parking  lot, adding  a guarded  gate, and  adding  more  security monitors.\n\nAgain, all hotel employees are responsible for keeping the property as safe as possible. Employees  must  report  any  suspicious activity  or  person  to  management. Guests, too, can do their part. Placards should be conspicuously  placed  in  guest  rooms  warning guests to keep their doors locked, not divulge their room number, and report any concerns to the front desk.\n\n",

Due to courts' findings  of  landowner  liability  for  third-party criminal acts, eliminating or at least reducing the risk of any criminal activities must be an important component of any property's riskmanagement  plan. Ensuring  public  safety within the facility itself is, of course, essential. Parking lots and adjacent areas, however, are equally  important  and  should  not  be  overlooked. This article discusses the landowner's potential liability for the criminal acts of third parties and describes some crime-abatement actions that can be accomplished through facility  design. Of  course, landowners  should seek their own counsel for specific remedies that  might  fit  their  particular  circumstances. For  the  purposes  of  this  article, the  term 'landowner' will  include  owners, managers, tenants, and lessors.\n\n",

      "content": "L ittle  in-depth  analysis  is  available  concerning criminal acts occurring in parking garages or  parking  lots. Crime  statistics, however, clearly indicate that parking facilities are the location of much criminal behavior. A Crime Control Institute study in Minneapolis showed that many of the police departments' chronic-call  locations  were  businesses  with\n\nparking  lots  (Berlonghi, 1990, 259). In  1993 over six million simple assaults were reported throughout  the  United  States, and  a  large percentage  of  those  incidents  occurred  in parking facilities (Maguire and Pastore, 1995, 249). In 1994 parking lots and garages represented the second-most-frequent location for attempts to take property without injury and the most-frequent location for motor-vehicle thefts (Maguire and Pastore, 1996, 230). Furthermore, the same report showed 8 percent of all violent crimes, 7 percent of all rapes and sexual assaults, and 7 percent of total assaults in 1994 occurred in parking lots or garages.\n\nDespite the risks, parking lots and garages clearly  are  critical  to  the  success  of  major public facilities. In terms of sports events, only 5 percent of fans attending games use public transportation, while a similar number arrive on leased buses (Baim, 1994, 200). Considering  the  large  number  of  professional-sports venues (both indoor and out) as well as managed college stadiums and arenas, and adding to  those  the  number  of  hotels, convention centers, and  similar  public-access  facilities, one can easily imagine that there are several million parking spaces in use by major facilities in the United States.\n\nSecurity Risk. Parking facilities generally cover large areas and are open to the public. While there is plenty of activity inside a shopping mall, office building, stadium, or convention  center, there  is  relatively  little  or, at times, no activity at all in the parking lot. Additionally, to make the best use of space, cars are  parked  fairly  close  together, resulting  in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntight, shadowy  spaces  between  parked  cars that generally are excellent hiding places for criminals. Moreover, due to the cost and availability  of  land, many  venues  rely  on  multilevel parking garages. Parking garages typically have poor sight lines and numerous dark  corners  and  stairwells, making  them  a potential harbor for criminal activity. Patrons walking  through  a  parking  lot  or  a  parking garage  may  be  inattentive  to  such  hiding places or to other individuals in the lot.\n\nAs we've just described, then, parking facilities  present  a  significant  opportunity  for criminal  activity. Hospitality-industry  professionals, however, often rank parking lots and related facilities near the bottom of their list of risk-management concerns. For example, a 1991 survey of approximately 600 sports- and special-event professionals evaluated a variety of risk concerns (Berlonghi, 1996, 13). Few of those  surveyed  felt  that  parking-lot  security was a concern. Indeed, only one in ten felt that 'no parking lot security' was a problem at all (when offered that choice among a list of security issues). In other words, parking-lot security was  rated lower by these events professionals  than  were  other  risk  concerns such as weather conditions, insufficient budgets, one-of-a-kind or first-time events, and slippery  surfaces. We  wonder, however, whether those  survey  results  indicate  that  parkinglot-related crimes are simply under-reported. Outside security firms or police often handle those  crimes  and  may  not  report  specific events  to  facility  managers. It's  also  possible that landowners misunderstand and underestimate  the  magnitude  of  potential  problems, perceiving  crimes  perpetrated  in  parking  areas to be low risk. On the other hand, when specifically asked about just parking lots,'lack of  security' represented  the  highest-rated concern by those same survey respondents.\n\n▶\n\n",

      "title": "CIVIL LIABILITY",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "V ictims  of  criminal  misconduct  are  increasingly  seeking  compensation  from  the  owner or  manager  of  the  property  on  which  the criminal activity occurred (Gordon and Brill, 1996, 1-6). Such claims fall under the rules of premises liability  and, typically, Gordon  and Brill  point  out, allege  a  problem  with  the property's security system. Premise liability is founded on negligence principles. In a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove (1) the defendant owed  the plaintiff a particular standard of care, (2) the defendant deviated from  that  standard, and  (3)  the  deviation caused the plaintiff's injury.\n\nIn  the  case  of  a  person's  injury  or  loss while using a parking facility, the critical question is whether the landowner had a duty to protect that individual while she was using the parking  facility. A  landowner  normally  does not  have  a  duty  to  protect  individuals  from the  criminal  acts  of  third  parties  unless  the acts  are  foreseeable. Yet  if  crimes  on  the property  are  likely, then  a  landowner  has some duty to warn customers, guests, and others  who  may  seek  access  to  the  property. A landowner incurs varying degrees of duty toward  three  types  of  people: 'business  invitees,' licensees, and trespassers. The scope of this  article  is  limited  to  the  first  category  of individuals.\n\nThe duty owed to someone who is on the premises for a business purpose or who is providing some benefit to the landowner (i.e., a business invitee) is a high duty. The court requires  a  landowner  to  protect  this  person from any hidden dangers the landowner knew about, or should have known about. With respect  to  parking  facilities, the  fact  that  such areas  may  be  remote  does  not  alleviate  a landowner's duty to warn a business invitee of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nall possible risks and, of course, to keep the facility well maintained and in good repair (see Ammon, 1993, and Maloy, 1993).\n\nBurden  of  Proof. Premises  liability  can arise from such seemingly innocent activities as a drunk committing an unintentional battery. In one case, for example, a female spectator was walking across a parking lot after a college  football  game  when  an  intoxicated man fell on her, breaking her leg [ Bearman v. University  of  Notre  Dame, 453  N.E.2d  1196 (1983) ]. The  court  in  this  case  considered whether the university had notice of the potential harm and, once the university had notice, whether  it  had  a  duty  to  protect  its patrons. The court concluded that the university  not  only  had  notice  but  also  owed  the spectator, a  business  invitee, a  duty  of  safe ingress and egress from the facility.\n\nAnother pertinent case involving a parking  lot  and  foreseeable  conduct  is Bishop v. Fair Lanes Georgia Bowling, (803 F.2d 1548, 1986). A group of bowlers complained to the bowling alley's management of harassing behavior  by  the  bowlers  on  an  adjacent  lane. The management took no action and, moreover, continued  to  serve  alcohol  to  the harassing group despite their obvious intoxication. At 2:30 A.M. the two parties were the last to leave the facility, at which opportunity the  intoxicated  group  attacked  the  other bowlers in the alley's parking lot. The Bishop court concluded that a jury could reasonably find that the bowling alley's managers knew or should have known of the potential for a dangerous  altercation  between  the  patrons before  the  altercation  occurred  and  would, therefore, be  negligent  for  taking  no  action and  failing  to  make  its  premises  safe  for invitees.\n\nThus, the key point of analysis is the existence of information that puts a landowner on\n\nnotice that an assault or accident is foreseeable (Miller, 1993; van der Smissen, 1990, 3). Attaching foreseeability to seemingly random accidents further expands the specter of liability  should  serious  criminal  acts  occur. In other words, don't be in denial about potential liability.\n\nThe  Premonition. Notice  is  the  key  requirement for proving foreseeability. For instance, in a suit stemming from a brawl during a 1980 AC/DC rock concert, the concert promoters claimed they did not have notice because 'no unruly behavior had taken place in the  arena, no  fights  had  broken  out, and  no drinking  had  been  observed' (McCarthy, 1995, 7). Even though the arena had no prior problems, the  court  nevertheless  concluded that the promoter was on notice because a police officer  had  investigated  prior  AC/DC tour  stops  and  had  knowledge  of  various problems at other venues, which he reported to  the  concert  promoters. The  officer  also knew  that  when  the  band  appeared  at  the arena  the  previous  year, the  band  had  attracted  a  rowdy, drunk, drug-using  crowd even though apparently no specific incidents of inappropriate behavior had officially been reported  [ Comastro  v. Village  of  Rosemont, 461 N.E. 2d 616 (1984) ]. Other cases have also stressed  the  need  for  landowners  to  act  assertively to deter criminal conduct when they have information that indicates the possibility of such conduct (see, for example: McNeal v. Days Inn of America, Inc., 498 S.E.2d 294 (Ga. 1998); and Whataburger, Inc., v. Rockwell, 706 So.2d 1226 (Ala. 1997).\n\nMean Streets. If a facility's location is in an area with a significant history of assaults, muggings, and robberies, landowners may be liable if they take no steps to protect patrons from known potential dangers. That is, foreseeability issues can extend even to criminal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nactivity in surrounding neighborhoods (Clery, 1995, 5). A  classic  example  of  such  a  case  is Banks  v. Hyatt  Corporation [ Banks  v. Hyatt Corporation, 722 F. 2d 214 (5th Circuit, 1984) ]. Hotel guest Dr. Robert Banks was robbed and shot to death as he approached the New Orleans Hyatt Hotel's front entrance. His widow and family brought a lawsuit against Hyatt, asserting that, although Banks was not actually on the hotel's property at the time of the robbery and shooting, reasonable precautions had not  been  taken  by  the  hotel  to  protect  him, and the hotel had a duty to do so. Hyatt argued that it had taken reasonable precautions to protect its guests and could not be expected to  protect  guests  who were off the premises. Besides, the hotel contended, 'Dr. Banks was guilty  of  contributory  negligence  or  had  at least assumed the risk by going out' (Rutherford and McConnell, 1987, 60).The jury heard testimony from both sides, including evidence that Hyatt managers were aware of numerous robberies  and  shootings  that  had  previously occurred in and around the same area where Banks lost his life. Further, Hyatt employees had  logged  incidents, many  involving  weapons, in other areas around the hotel. The jury looked at the evidence of prevalent crime in the area and determined that the security precautions  provided  by  the  hotel  were  simply not sufficient; that the hotel did have a duty to 'take  reasonable  care  for  the  safety  of  its guests, and that the duty [extended] to adjacent areas where guests [were] likely to go and where  the  hotel  could  effectively  maintain control of safety' (Rutherford  and  McConnell, 1987, 62). The  jury  awarded  the Banks family $975,000.\n\nBack to the Future. To a degree, the frequency of prior acts represents the probability  that  a  certain  risk  or  injury  might  occur (Nilson and Edington, 1982, 34-37). Yet even in the  absence  of  prior  criminal  activity,\n\nlandowners must take precautions to prevent reasonably  foreseeable  crimes. Rather  than examining  just  the  frequency  of  prior  acts, courts  are  examining  all  the  circumstances that  together  indicate  whether  a  landowner should  have  reasonably  foreseen  a  harm. In making this determination, the court considers the following factors (Berlonghi, 1996, 13; Gordon and Brill, 1996, 5-6):\n\nTherefore, it  is  vital  for  landowners  to work on the implementation of a comprehensive  crime-prevention  program, addressing all  reasonably  foreseeable  criminal  actions. This  means  that  landowners  should  include parking-area security as a critical concern in their risk-management plans (Ammon, 1993, 117; Berlonghi, 1990, 10-11). While  it  is impossible  to  eliminate  all  potential  suits, risk-management plans can help identify, document, and eliminate potential risks, and may reduce  the  prospect  of  being  sued  (van  der Smissen, 1990, 3).\n\nTo  determine  liability, courts  determine whether  a  property's  security  precautions were sufficient to prevent the criminal activity and whether patrons were warned of impending risks  (allowing  for  the  impossibility of  predicting  all  dangerous  incidents  or  violent behavior). When reviewing specific precautionary measures, landowners should ask the following (Clery, 1995, 5):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLater  in  this  paper  we  address  common yet  critical  approaches  to  risk  management (e.g., security  patrols, alcohol  management, crowd  control). First, we  discuss  design  factors  that  are  often  overlooked  and  yet  can substantially affect the safety and protection that a facility can offer its guests.\n\n",

      "content": "E nvironmental design refers to the process of building or renovating facilities so that their physical  characteristics  serve  aesthetic  and\n\npractical  functions, including  crime  abatement or prevention. The use of architectural details to enhance patrons' security is spreading  throughout  the  world  (Sheard, 1995, 26-28). Litigants  claiming  negligent  facility supervision are starting to argue that an approach  such  as  Crime  Prevention  through Environmental  Design  (CPTED), first addressed by Jeffery (1971), could have reduced criminal  activities  or, had  a  CPTED-like system  been  used, it  would  have  uncovered foreseeable hazards (Gordon  and Brill, 1996, 1-6).\n\nCPTED principles. CPTED is a relatively easy and economical way to augment security  efforts  if  incorporated  at  the  time  of  facility construction. It is possible, although somewhat  more  complicated  to  implement CPTED after the fact. The general principles of  CPTED  include  natural  surveillance, access control, and controlling the environment, all  of  which  can  be  used  effectively  to  discourage violence in parking facilities.\n\nCPTED involves carefully selecting building  features, materials, and  systems  to meet established passive-security and activesecurity requirements. Passive security refers to the physical design, such as lighting, while active security refers to the human element, such  as  uniformed  guards, intercoms, and closed-circuit cameras.\n\nEven  though  CPTED  has  been  around for  almost  30  years, many  parking  facilities have been designed with little or no attention to security. There are several reasons for this oversight. For one thing, little time is devoted to parking-facility design in architecture curricula and the principles of CPTED are thus not widely recognized by developers and architects. Further, since the parking lot's design is often looked at as basic if not routine, that task is generally left to the newest and least experienced person on the architectural team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLack of planning, therefore, means that active security methods are later needed to correct problems that could have been avoided if the architectural team had incorporated CPTED principles from the start.\n\n",

      "title": "▶ CPTED Concepts",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "With respect to parking facilities, CPTED includes  the  following  areas: lighting, natural surveillance, stair towers and elevator access controls, and restrooms.\n\nThe  Light  Ahead. Lighting  is  generally considered to be the most important security feature  in  parking  facilities. It is a  wellestablished  fact  that  good  lighting  deters criminal  activity  and  increases  the  public's perception that the facility is safe (which may increase  patronage). Installing  a  parking-lot lighting system reduces the need for active security and reduces or eliminates car break-ins.\n\nThe basic principles of lighting design include illumination, uniformity, and glare. Illumination is simply the intensity of light falling on a surface. Uniformity refers to the ability to achieve a consistent level of lighting throughout  the  parking  facility. (Consistent  lighting can allow both patrons and security personnel to  see  into  the  far  edges  of  parking  stalls, as compared  to  seeing  only  the  driving  lanes well.) Glare reduces the contrast of an object against its background, making it difficult for the eye to perceive depth accurately.This condition  is  especially  dangerous  for  individuals with  weak  or  impaired  vision. Glare  can  be minimized by the careful selection and positioning of fixtures in the parking facility. (For example, many  light  manufacturers  design lights  with  glare  shields, and  those  lights  can be located above the parked cars rather than in the driving lanes to further reduce glare.)\n\nOne  approach  to  achieving  the  desired quality  of  lighting  is  the  Level  of  Service (LOS) approach developed by Mary S. Smith (1996, 2-9). Each  level  is  represented  by  a grade, and this approach should be as familiar to  parking-facility  owners, city  officials, and architects  as  it  is  to  traffic  engineers. The highest grade is LOS A, which denotes superior design; LOS B is above average; LOS C is average; and LOS D is the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America's minimum standard.\n\nIn addition to meeting industry standards and providing glare-free lighting, lights must be: reliable, easy  to  maintain, able  to  withstand the elements, and vandal proof.\n\nWhere good lighting is not available due to  design  or  expense, concrete  staining  may be  an  alternative. Concrete  staining  is  the process  of  dyeing  walls, ceilings, and  beam soffits white to increase brightness. This costeffective method has been shown in some designs to increase the LOS by an entire grade. A  top-quality  concrete  stain  will  last  about ten  years. A  good  white  paint  will  have  the same  effect  but  requires  constant  maintenance. (One  problem  with  white  stain  or paint, however, is that it may encourage graffiti. Fortunately, there  are  anti-graffiti  stains that accommodate easy cleanup.)\n\nVision  Quest. The  second  most  critical security-design  issue  is  natural  surveillance, or  the  ability  of  individuals  to  observe  their surroundings. Natural  surveillance  is  easiest to achieve in open parking facilities; however, it is not  impossible  to  achieve  in  parking garages.The most difficult garages in which to use  natural-surveillance  concepts  are  those garages  that  have  numerous  sloped  parking areas. So  today's  designers  are  shying  away from  extensive  ramps. Moreover, because openness increases natural surveillance, high\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nceilings  and  open  exterior  facades  are  now preferred  as  well. Clearly, an  underground parking garage cannot allow for open facades. Yet  there  are  underground-design  schemes that incorporate natural light and ventilation, and  that  make  it  easy  to  hear  a  person  in distress.\n\nNatural  surveillance  also  includes  the manner in which employees direct people and vehicles within the parking facility. For example, it  is  best  to  direct  pedestrians  to  designated areas where other people are likely to be walking (and criminals absent), rather than to let those guests wander through the parking facility. Likewise, concentrating entrances and exits makes supervision of those areas easier.\n\nThe Glass Tower. Since stairs, lobbies, and elevators are high-risk areas for personal injury, CPTED addresses such areas with an eye toward open design. One of the basic precepts of  CPTED is to plan stairways and elevator lobbies  as  openly  as  the  building  codes  will permit.The more visibility one has the better, including using exterior and open-air spaces. Where  that  option  is  not  available  due  to weather  or  code  constraints, glass  may  be  a compromise, allowing  both  protection  and visibility.\n\nA Safe Place. If the facility is in a low-risk area, access control may seem unnecessary at first. Nevertheless, it  is  prudent  to  consider access control in the design stage, as the risk level may change with time. Screens and gates can be used to discourage unauthorized people from entering the parking area. If possible, the parking facility's design should guide vehicular  traffic  through  gated  pathways. Even if there is no charge for parking, an individual  receiving  a  ticket  and  interacting with an attendant is given the impression of security. Moreover, measures  such  as  those discourage criminal activity.\n\nLocation of security personnel is a critical CPTED component. Some landowners don't wish  to  'advertise' potential  security  concerns, and therefore locate their security personnel  and  parking-attendant  booths  to  the rear of the facility. That thinking is backward; according  to  CPTED  principles, landowners should locate security personnel or attendant booths at the front of the parking area, next to the primary entrance. Besides giving security  employees  a  clear  view  of  the  property, it's  a  way  for  the  owner  to  make  a  public statement  about  the  importance  of  security and guests' safety.\n\nThe  Hiding  Place. Landowners  should not include restrooms in parking-facility designs, especially in underground garages. Such restrooms  present  special  security  problems because they make excellent hiding spots for criminals. Many patrons recognize the potential danger  and  avoid  using  such  facilities themselves, resulting  in  minimal  traffic  and thereby  presenting  a  potentially  dangerous condition for the patron who happens to use the restroom.Within the confines of the shopping mall, convention center, or office building  is  a  much  more  appropriate  place  for public restrooms.\n\nSecret Weapons. While CPTED generally encompasses  passive  design  concepts, a  few active  ones  are  notable. Active  design  concepts include panic buttons, emergency phones, intercoms, sound surveillance, closedcircuit  cameras, and  trained  guards. Parking facilities  that  failed  to  incorporate  CPTED during the planning stage often find it necessary to use active techniques later. Although all of those features have obvious advantages, by themselves they are not an alternative to CPTED. Further, they tend to be expensive, and  some  are  prone  to  abuse  by  pranksters and vandals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

In a recent survey of municipal football  stadiums, 86  percent  of  the  respondents 'always' had security personnel located in the parking lot before and after the game (Ammon, 1993, 117). According to that study, only 3 percent of the respondents did not offer any security protection in parking lots.

Private security firms, facility  employees, or  a  blend  of  employees, private security, and law-enforcement agencies  provided  the  remaining  security. There is no consensus on the number of onduty security personnel required for given situations  or  even  about  the  best  security measures. Risk-management  professionals agree, however, that providing adequate security  is  an  ongoing, evolutionary  process  that requires  consistent  and  detailed  monitoring (Ammon, 1993, 117-120; Christiansen, 1986, 46-52; Miller, 1989, 419-437; Ross, 1985, 22-29; van der Smissen, 1990, section 23, 3).\n\nOne common measure is the use of roving security patrols. In many parking lots, such as those  of  malls, hotels, schools, and  large\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstores, roving patrols can be effective and useful. Wal-Mart, for example, now employs uniformed  security  personnel  on  golf  carts  in some regions.Wal-Mart conducted a study on store crime and discovered that 80 percent of non-shoplifting  crimes  occurred  outside  the store. A Wal-Mart in Tampa, Florida, in particular, had been the scene of 226 car thefts, 25 purse snatchings, 32 burglaries, and 14 armed robberies prior to its implementing the golfcart idea. Once the golf-cart program was in place, however, crime outside the Tampa store was reduced to zero (Lee, 1997, E1).Although a  guard with a vehicle of some sort and the necessary  security  equipment  (e.g., two-way radio, flashing lights) can cost about $45,000 a year, there is a strong possibility that such an investment can reduce actual risk and therefore help the store avoid costly lawsuits (or, at least, give  the  store's  security  efforts  some credibility  once  in  court). Wal-Mart, for  example  was  ordered  to  pay  75  percent  of  a $1.5-million award to a man shot in the head in  a  Wal-Mart  parking  lot  (Lee, 1997, E1). With that in mind, $45,000 a year is a small price to pay to achieve better security and a reputation  within  the  neighborhood  and among customers as a safe place to shop.\n\nThe  Crowd. Another  risk-management technique  used  to  protect  patrons  when  entering and exiting a facility involves the use of crowd-management  personnel  (Ammon, Jr., 1995, 16-19). Traditionally, those  individuals were used to inspect patrons' belongings for alcoholic beverages at the entrance to events (e.g., a  football  game  or  a  concert). Today, those same workers are as likely to assist individuals (e.g., the elderly or disabled) as required and  to direct visibly intoxicated individuals to a secure waiting room. Crowdmanagement personnel are now used for all sorts  of  public  events, whether  it  be  a  rock\n\nconcert, an exposition at a conference center, or a farmers' market at a shopping mall. In all cases, some  training  for  the  job  is  desirable. The number of security staff needed can vary based  on  the  following  factors  (Berlonghi, 1996, 13):\n\nSign of the Times. Signs are an important consideration  in  a  risk-management  and safety plan. In the parking facility itself, signs should  assist patrons  in  moving  quickly through the lot or garage to their destinations. Lost  and  confused  guests-whether  arriving or  leaving-make easy targets  for  criminals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLandowners  therefore  should  strive  to  provide clear, visible  signs  that  are  both  understandable and memorable so those guests can safely  move to and from their vehicles. Furthermore, signs can be used to deter criminals by  announcing  that  regular  security  patrols and  electronic-monitoring  systems  are  in place.\n\nContract. Risk-management planning should, of  course, reduce  potential  fiscal losses arising from the misconduct of others. Appropriate  contractual  provisions  help  to protect against such losses-in this case, when dealing  with  parking-security  personnel  retained from outside firms. Contracts with independent security vendors should contain a clause promising indemnity and setting forth what specific risk-management steps are to be taken  to  secure  the  parking  areas. The  contract  should  specify  the  number  of  security personnel to be deployed, when those workers  will  change  shifts, what  quality-control measures  are  to  be  used  (e.g., spot  inspections), how security personnel will handle intoxicated  persons, what  specific  actions  to take should a criminal act or personal-injury event  occur, and  what  follow-up  reporting procedures are appropriate after an injury or crime.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he design of a parking facility and the level of  security  needed  depend  on  many  factors. Because there is no 'one size fits all' solution, a  security  audit  is  a  good  way  to  determine exactly  what  security  a  particular  facility needs.\n\nThe security audit is actually quite simple. A facility might exist that originally incorporated CPTED but that has undergone many\n\nphysical changes over the years. For example, imagine a convention center that started out as a simple rectangular structure. Now, picture how various asymmetrical additions could be built into the parking lots over time. Such additions now make it impossible to view large sections  of  the  parking  lot  at  the  same  time from the same vantage point. A facility such as  this  should  undergo  a  security  audit  to identify  the  security  lapses  caused  by  the building expansions. Additionally, if the facility  has  not  changed  its  exterior  lighting  system, the older system will almost certainly be insufficient to meet the current needs of the reconfigured  parking  areas, including  being unable to light some corners at all (Gordon and Brill, 1996, 6). A security audit will show what actions need to be taken to return the level of security to where it once was.\n\nWitness  for  the  Defense. One  aspect  of crime prevention is that the sight lines of potential witnesses (patrons, employees, security personnel, and passersby) not be obstructed or hindered. For example, there should always be a clear view into and out of any cashier's cubicle. If the windows of the cubicle are covered with posters, handbills, or other advertising  or  personal  effects, a  cashier  would  be unlikely to witness a nearby crime, should it occur. By the same token, the posters would also  hinder  a  potential  witness's  view  of  an attack  on  the  cashier  (Gordon  and  Brill, 1996, 6).\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Mark Beattie and Jacinta Gau\n\nViolence is the leading cause of workplace fatalities  in  the  hospitality  industry  (U.S. Department  of  Labor, 2002). Preparation  for dealing with a crisis situation is vital to management  and  employee  training. There  are two categories of workplace violence: explicit and  implicit. Explicit  violence  is  specifically directed at a hospitality employee, while implicit  violence  occurs  in  a  hospitality  establishment but is not directed at an employee. Managers and employees need training tools to  effectively  manage  violence  prevention, crisis management, and the aftermath of traumatic incidents. Consider the following case:\n\nBruce Larson, Jr., was fatally shot in his room at the  Orchard  Inn  in  Wenatchee, Washington. Larson, his  brother, and  several  friends  had rented  rooms  at  the  Inn  during  Wenatchee's 1998 Apple Blossom Festival. The group threw a  party. A  friend  of  Larson's  invited  a  young man  named  Jeremy  Read  to  the  party  at  the Inn. At three o'clock that morning, an altercation  ensued, and  Read  pulled  out  a  gun  and shot Larson in the chest ( Larson v. MOA Hospitality, Inc., 2003).\n\nLarson's  estate  subsequently  filed  suit against MOA Hospitality, Inc. (the corporation\n\nthat owned the Orchard Inn), for breaching its legal duty to protect guests from harm. The estate alleged that the Inn should have known that criminal  activity  increases  during  the  Apple Blossom  Festival, should  have  taken  greater steps to ensure guests' safety, and should have prevented Read from entering the property.The Washington Court of Appeals, citing its holding in Wilbert v. Metro Park Dist. of Tacoma (1998, 10), reasoned that '[W]hen there is no evidence that  a  business  owner  knew  of  the  dangerous propensities  of  the  individual  responsible  for the crime and there is no history of such crimes on the premises, criminal conduct is unforeseeable as a matter of law.' The court entered summary  judgment  in  favor  of  respondent  MOA Hospitality because the record failed to establish  that  Orchard  Inn  recognized-or  reasonably should have recognized-that Read posed a foreseeable threat to Larson's safety.\n\nThe  linchpin  of  the  Larson  decision  was foreseeability: An innkeeper has a duty to protect guests who are within a zone of foreseeable danger. Had the record indicated that the Orchard  Inn  knew  or  should  have  known  that Read was dangerous, summary judgment would have  been  denied, and  the  case  would  have been put before a jury.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWould you have been ready for this situation? How well trained are you to deal with a violent  situation  on  your  property?  Have your employees been adequately prepared to deal with such situations? Is your night auditor trained to be alert for potentially dangerous situations? Do your housekeepers have a procedure to follow if they discover weapons or  other  dangerous  items  in  a  room?  Does your human resources manager know what to do for employees who are victims of domestic abuse or stalkers?\n\nWorkplace violence exists globally in all segments of industry.The European Commission defines workplace violence as 'Incidents where persons are abused, threatened or assaulted  in  circumstances  related  to  their work, involving  an  explicit  or  implicit  challenge  to  their  safety, well-being  or  health' (Wynn, Clarkin, Cox, and Griffiths, 1997). Violence is noted in reports from the European Agency  for  Safety  and  Health, the  United States  National  Institute  of  Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the United States Department of Labor. The hospitality industry is among the top five most dangerous industries  in  which  to  work, ranking  higher than  police  in  prevalence  of  violence  (Hoel and Einarsen, 2003).\n\nAccording  to  Isaacs  (2004, 13), there are  four  categories  of  perpetrator-victim relationships:\n\nDue  to  the  constant  and  sometimes  intense face-to-face contact in service encoun-\n\nters  in  the  hotel  and  hospitality  businesses, physical and psychological stressors are often intertwined in the conditions contributing to a violent situation (Hoel and Einarsen, 2003).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "C risis management  theory  combines  three views  of  workplace  violence-psychological, social-political, and technical-structural-and pragmatic  planning  for  an  emergency  situation  is  important. From  each  of  these  viewpoints, crisis  situations  can  be  assessed  by examining the causes, consequences, cautions, and  coping  mechanisms  of  impending  situations (Pearson and Clair, 1998). Tools for crisis management planning can then be provided  in  the  curricula  of  management training programs, and hospitality employees will subsequently be prepared to deal with the aftermath of a violent situation.\n\nThe most extreme form of workplace violence  is  homicide. Homicide  within  the  service sector accounted for 52 percent of all 347 workplace  fatalities  in  that  sector  in  2002 (U.S. Dept. of  Labor, 2004). Retail  trade workers under the age of 18 were the second highest  grouping  of  workplace  fatalities  between  1992  and  2000; 63  percent  of  those deaths were attributed to violent acts (NIOSH, 2003). Homicide  is  the  leading cause  of  occupational  death  for  women  and occurs predominately in eating and drinking establishments  (Levin, Hewitt, and  Misner, 1996). Because statistical tracking is generalized  and  inconsistent, the  available  data  are limited  in  scope  (Hoel  and  Einarsen, 2003), and  the  limited  empirical  research  available indicates a lack of effective training tools.\n\nWorkplace  violence  can  devastate  businesses  financially, especially  when  litigation results  from  an  incident. Statistics  provided\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby Jury Verdict Research show that, '[A]ccording  to  the  reviews  of  more  than 3,000  verdicts  rendered  since  1993, the  median compensation awarded by juries against hotels for [sic] assaults [was] $275,000' (Donohue, 2000, 12). A study by the Liberty Mutual  Research  Center  for  Safety  and Health placed the costs of nonfatal workplace violence  at  $84  million  between  1993  and 1996 (Hashemi and Webster, 1998).\n\nAgain, training is important; many violent situations  are  preventable  before  they  escalate. The  Equal  Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enunciated these guidelines  in  1965: Establish  company  policies, train  employees, support  employees' legal  rights, implement  investigative  procedures, and punish the wrongdoer, not the victim (Donohue, 2004).These guidelines enable the hospitality manager to spot and prevent a situation before it becomes a problem. There will, however, continue  to  be  unforeseeable events, such  as  those  that  transpired  in  the Larson case.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "D ata collection is central to the success of a preventive training program and vital to prevention of workplace violence. The data pro-\n\ngram  logs  incidents  occurring  within  some discrete reporting period, as are the data complied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These incidents  are  coded  as  explicit  or  implicit, then narrowed into 'categories of interest' to facilitate incident analysis (Rossman and Rallis, 2003, 321). These categories of interest reflect the  four  types  of  perpetrator-victim relationships described in Table 5.6.\n\nTaxonomizing workplace violence in this manner provides the foundation for a series of  category-specific  case  studies. These  case studies focus on identifying the training tools that exist to enable the hospitality employee to identify and manage a crisis situation effectively. Case study methods are based on developing a participatory relationship between the  researcher  and  the  participants  through interviews  and  compilation  of  material  culture such as press coverage and police reports (Shank, 2002). A  series  of  case  studies  ultimately  results  in  what  Shank  (2002, 55)  describes  as  a 'cumulative  case  study, a  single topic  examined  through  the  perspectives  of many different case samplings. A single complex  case  is  built  by  ordering  of  individual cases.' Information from these case studies is coded  according  to  standardized  organizational  schemes  for  cross-case  displays. The displays are conceptually ordered to highlight the three focus areas: prevention, crisis management, and  aftermath. These  displays  are analyzed using a case-ordered effects matrix\n\nTable 5.6 Categories of Interest by Incident Type\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto  explain  different  effects  that  each  emergent  theme  may  have  (Shank, 2002). The emergent themes point out critical areas for hospitality  curricula. To  explain  and  justify the identified emergent themes and their relevance to practice, researchers rely on 'assertorial' logic, which  'draws  on  supportive evidence  to  convince  the  reader  that  conditions in the new circumstances are sufficiently similar to the original research conditions for generalization  to  be  appropriate' (Rossman and Rallis, 2003, 105). Replication of this research  model  in  other  settings  adds  to  the reliability  and  generalizability  of  the  findings. Trustworthiness  is  maintained  through methodological  rigor  in  the  interview  and fieldwork procedures.\n\nFurther research focuses on the recognition  of  stressors  that  can  catalyze  violent situations, as  well  as  problems  such  as  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that victims and witnesses may develop in the aftermath of an incident. Models used in emergency responder  curricula-such  as  the  Assaulted Staff Action Program (ASAP), used with police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical  technicians-may  offer  useful  templates to develop this curriculum component (Flannery, 1998). The  hospitality  industry  has  an\n\nobligation to provide a safe and healthy environment for its guests and employees. Huntley  (2004, 1)  asserts, 'A  workplace  shooting that  claims  the  lives  of  an  employee  and  a customer would be a nightmare for any company. For a retailer dependent on public perception, it's a  crisis that  demands  careful handling.' The time has come to develop curricula that enable managers to better prepare for an incident of violence and more competently  address  the  aftermath  and  ramifications. Only then will the hospitality industry be in a better situation to manage a crisis such as the following before, during, and after the event.\n\nNovember 10, 2004, Chicago Tribune: At  2:30 A.M., Gregg P . Phillips, clad in a bulletproof vest, used an Uzi 9mm assault rifle to fatally shoot his  girlfriend, Sandra Wisniewski, at the Comfort  Suites  Hotel  in  Oak  Ridge, Wisconsin. A German businessman staying in the next room was also killed, and two other people were injured. Phillips  took  a  hostage, whom  he  ultimately  released  unharmed. Police  called  the rampage a 'domestic violence situation.' Upon surrender, Phillips  asked, 'How  many  people did I kill?' (Black, 2004).\n\n",

      "content": "In  discussing  the  ways  that  hotel  organizations  have  changed, we  pointed  out  that  in earlier times food played a significant role in the  organizational  structure  and  product/ service mix of hotels. It has been speculated that  the  preeminent  role  played  by  hotel foodservice in society became significantly diminished  with  the  onset  of  Prohibition  and during  the  1920s. People  stopped  going  to foodservice establishments where they couldn't 'get a drink.' Prohibition gave rise to competition  from  street  restaurants  that  operated sub  rosa  as  speakeasies. These  restaurants were not constricted by the visible, public nature  of  hotel  dining  rooms. This  diminished role  was  compounded  in  many  ways  by  the depression  years  of  the  1930s  and  the  war years of the 1940s.\n\nIn general, it was difficult for most hotels' foodservice  to  recover  from  the  effects  of\n\nrecognition lost during Prohibition. Recovery was  further  delayed  by  the  Depression  and the uncertainty and reordered national priorities that accompanied World War II.\n\nIn 1945, at the conclusion of World War II, well-documented  major  shifts  in  population and economic emphasis began to occur. Freestanding restaurants continued to compete effectively  with  hotel  foodservice. Movement was  away  from  downtown  and  central  business district hotels. Motels and motor hotels were  built  on  highway  and  freeway  interchanges to take advantage of the mobility of the  American  family. Fast-food  restaurants, too, affected  the  away-from-home  eating habits of Americans. Consequently, many hotel companies saw as too great the cost of providing high-quality competition in the face of these forces. The net effect was that many hotel guests and operators came to believe that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhotel foodservice was little more than a necessary evil. For many operations, this became a  self-fulfilling  prophecy, and  hotel  foodservice floundered for many years.\n\nThis situation has been reversed in recent years. Of the many factors mentioned earlier that  forced  organizational  change  (market segmentation, return  on  investment, demographic shifts, and so forth), it seems that return  on  investment  has  played  a  dominant role in this turnaround. The double-whammy issues of construction cost and return on investment expectations of people outside the hospitality  industry  strongly  suggest  that space  devoted  to  foodservice  should  contribute at least its share to the profit structure of the modern hotel service system.\n\nAs a result, hotels seem to be willing to try  anything  to  capture  additional  revenue, prestige, and  competitive  advantage. Among the tactics addressed in several of the articles and essays included in this  section  are  partnering  with  restaurant  companies, outsourcing  a  hotel's  foodservice, new  catering  and beverage  management  strategies, celebrity chefs, and rethinking the entire role of hotel food and beverage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "O ver 35 years ago, Allen Hubsch (1966) suggested  a  number  of  ways  to  revitalize  hotel food and beverage service that have proved eerily prescient. Among his suggestions were:\n\nHubsch's article, now considered a classic, is among  the  suggested  readings  for  this section.\n\nRobert  H. Bosselman  is  the  director  of the Dedman School of Hospitality and Dedman Distinguished Professor of Hospitality at Florida  State  University. From  his  perspective, looking ahead to the future state of hotel food  and  beverage  operations, Bosselman provides an in-depth analysis of the way the hotel  food  and  beverage  organization  has changed over the last eight to ten years and offers  tantalizing  clues  and  examples  that echo the prescriptions proposed by Hubsch. He also addresses the structure of the organization, interactions of food and beverage elements within the lodging operation, operating ratios, and potential trends in this major-and expensive-operational component.\n\nDominic Provenzano is director of operations of the Downtown Marriott at Key Center in Cleveland, Ohio. From the perspective of a previous position as director of food and beverage, he provides front-line detail of how Bosselman's  theory  of  food  and  beverage plays out for the food and beverage director.\n\nIn  a  major  research  effort  that  began  in 1998, Laurette  Dubé, Cathy  Enz, Leo  Re-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naghan, and  Judy  Siguaw  of  the  Center  for Hospitality  Research  at  Cornell  University studied the best practices of hotels in the U.S. lodging industry. In their words, 'The goal of this  research  was  to  surface  and  summarize practices of use and value to the entire lodging  industry' (Dubé  et  al., 1999, 7). Siguaw and  Enz  summarize  several  of  the  practices from that study that have been developed by hotels to achieve the 'strategic charge of profitably  meeting  customer  needs' (1999, 50). The authors describe how top hotels integrate the ideas of restaurant design and conceptualization with all of the variables that affect the quality of the food and the experience for the guest.\n\nThe  concept  of  outsourcing  was  mentioned earlier in the context of how some hotel companies are rethinking the role of hotel food and beverage and how to maximize investments in facilities, furnishings, and equipment  for  foodservice  outlets. According  to Strate  and  Rappole  (1997), because  hotel restaurants  have  often  been  managed  as  a secondary function, owners and operators are questioning  the  conventional  wisdom  about how hotel food and beverage is conceived and managed. They  state  that  this  new  focus  on hotel  foodservice  results  in  innovative  concepts and strategic alliances with well-known restaurant  brands. In  their  article, they  analyze this trend outlining historic antecedents of the practice and use the Texas firm Bristol Hotel Company as a case study.\n\nFew  would  argue  that  should  a  hotel choose to do its own foodservice, a first-class executive chef is essential to allow a hotel organization  to  compete  effectively  for  food and beverage business in today's market. It is, however, fairly clear that chefs today do not have  the  dominant  role  they  had  a  century ago. Given  the  importance  of  the  food  and beverage function, as established by the fore-\n\ngoing articles, the chef is nevertheless an integral  part  of  the  competitive  strategy  and  a full-fledged  department  leader. He  or  she  is no longer purely a technician. This individual must  have  developed  a  significant  range  of managerial skills to complement the technical and artistic training we have come to expect from  an  executive  chef. The  appearance  of ultra-high-profile  celebrity  chefs  adds  another interesting variable to the food and beverage director's mix of challenges. If a hotel commits much of its food and beverage strategy to the talents of one famous person, it can enjoy a significant competitive advantage but also  become hostage to that person's whims and  personality. Many  high-profile  hotels  in Las Vegas have 'name' chef programs, and in many  major  population  centers, top  chefs have  made  their  hotels  destination  venues due to their fame in the kitchen.\n\nPatti  Shock  and  her  colleague  John  Stefanelli  highlight  the  importance  of  the  banquet and catering functions of hotel food and beverage in their piece, updated for this edition. With  the  increased  national  attention and focus on the importance of conferences, conventions, meetings, and events of all kinds, foodservice  professionals  who  specialize  in planning  and  serving  meals  and  beverages to  large  groups  of  people  are  increasingly important. The  authors  note, 'Although  onpremise  catering  is  generally  the  secondlargest  source  of  revenue  for  most  hotels, following  sleeping  rooms' and  'often  the highest  visibility  the  hotel  has  on  a  local level,' banquets and catering are still too often ignored by hotel school curricula. In this article, we partially address this lack.\n\nCatered  affairs  represent  a  significant contribution  to  the  profit  picture  of  hotel food and beverage service. The efficacy of a hotel's  efforts  in  selling  and  servicing  the group business market may very well be the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndifference  between  profitability  of  the  food and  beverage  function  and  some  less  desirable  outcome. Shock  and  Stefanelli  explore the  organization, personnel, and  processes of  the  catering  department  and  give  the reader  an  in-depth  view  of  catering  executives  and  banquet  organizations. The  article includes  Internet  addresses  for  additional information.\n\nIt is the revenue and visibility importance of the catering function that makes the energetic  essay  by  Rich  Benninger  so  intriguing. From rising at 6:00 A.M. or so, thinking today is the day he will 'get everything done' in the catering  and  convention  services  office  of  a 5,000-room resort hotel casino in Las Vegas, to hitting the sack after midnight, Benninger gives the reader an insider's view of life in the fast  lane  of  Vegas  catering  and  convention services. As executive director of catering and convention  services  at  the  Caesar's  Palace Resort Hotel and Casino, Benninger  is uniquely positioned to provide these insights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "I n  any  hotel  that  has  more  than  one  formal bar, there is usually a separate function within the food and beverage department called bar or beverage  management. Ideally, that  office coordinates all  matters  that  concern  liquors, beers, and wines. The beverage manager is responsibile  for  purchasing, receiving, storing, and  issuing  liquor, wine  and  beer  inventory, and  quite  obviously  has  the  managerial  responsibility to control that inventory.\n\nAdditionally, the beverage manager:\n\nThe  beverage  manager  administers  or manages up to four types of bars.\n\nThe front or public bar is that in which the guest can, if he or she so desires, interact with the  bartender  and  other  service  personnel. There are provisions for guest seating at the bar itself, which may be part of a restaurant or a separate room or area. Separate tables and stand-up areas may also be available for beverage service. A front bar may or may not incorporate entertainment.\n\nA service bar is a hidden bar designed for use by the hotel's food and beverage service staff only. It may serve one or more foodservice  areas  and/or  room  service, and  it  is  designed specifically for efficiency and economy of service. In most cases, speed is considered the  essential  ingredient  in  service  bars. Service bars typically are centrally located in the back of the house, out of guest view.\n\nPortable bars are designed for maximum flexibility and can be used in conjunction with beverage sales associated with guest activities anywhere in the hotel or on its grounds. This may  be  extended  in  resort  areas  to  include recreational areas.\n\nA new facility popular in many hotels is that  of  the  in-room  bar, mini-bar, or  honor bar.While sometimes the responsibility for inventory of these bars rests with room service, the  beverage  manager  in  most  cases  is  also deeply  involved  in  their  design, marketing, and control.\n\nIn  many  ways, the  beverage  manager's job  can  be  compared, in  terms  of  historical\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstereotype, to that of the housekeeper. Often the beverage manager has worked his or her way up through the ranks of beverage server and preparer and through experience, longevity, and interest becomes the beverage or  bar  manager. There  is  reason  to  believe that  in  many  ways  this  pattern  is  changing. Like many other areas of hotel management, the beverage management function now faces a range of issues that are more sophisticated and  complicated  than  traditional  beverage management problems of the past. It may be that the beverage managers of the future will have to bring to their job a level of managerial, organizational, and  administrative  sophistication that was previously unnecessary.\n\nThe issues, responsibilities, and structural management of the hotel's beverage function are analyzed and discussed by Valentino Lu-\n\nciani, professor  of  beverage  management  at the  University  of  Nevada, Las  Vegas. Luciani's essay, reprised here from the third edition, draws on his industry experience, research, and teaching beverage management and provides a view of how the modern beverage  manager  has  evolved  from  his  or  her historical counterparts.\n\nThe  planning, preparation, service, and management of food and beverage in modern hotels  have  changed  significantly  since  the first edition of this book was written. The essays, research, and  commentary  presented here are chosen to illustrate the breadth and depth  of  this  process  of  change. The  reader who is interested in hotel food and beverage should be able to synthesize an accurate vision of the practices and realities of this major operational division of modern hotels.\n\n",

A  typical characteristic is a market posting steady but not  significant  growth  and  emphasizing  cost containment and innovation.As lodging foodservice competes with the multitude of commercial foodservice operations for the consumer dollar, value  remains  the  focus  of both operators and consumers.

      "content": "'T he goal of our food service operations is to provide  the  highest  quality  of  food  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nservice in a sophisticated, comfortable ambience, by friendly and professional staff, ensuring that every patron returns,' states the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas. This statement, succinct and focused, exemplifies what lodging operations nationwide are seeking. Most lodging executives identify food and beverage operations as one of the more complex areas to manage in the entire lodging arena. Lodging  foodservice  not  only  involves  the  traditional difficulties associated with both producing  and  serving  food  and  beverages but  also  the  performance  of  these  functions every day, often 24 hours a day. The resulting labor  costs  and  operational  expenses  prove burdensome for many lodging establishments. In order for these food and beverage operations  to  survive  and  thrive, they  must  draw not only guests of the lodging facility but also consumers  from  the  external  market  of  the lodging  property. Hoteliers  are  analyzing their operations to identify ways of increasing the percentage of guests who stay to dine onsite, known as the capture rate.\n\nIn fact, the more profitable lodging food and beverage operations obtain more than 50 percent of their business from non-guests of the property.The hotel or motel guest is not a captive diner; he or she has many other opportunities for dining.Yet, in order for a hotel property  to  be  profitable, a  significant  percentage  of  sales  must  be  produced  by  food and beverage operations. To accomplish this, lodging  facilities  must  successfully  compete with  the  numerous  chains  and  independent restaurants  that  offer  a  variety  of  services. One  advantage  for  full-service  hotels  is  the banquet business, which can be a major revenue  producer  and  operate  at  a  high  profit margin. It becomes critical for lodging operators  to  research  tourists'  specific  food  needs and  wants, and  how  their  specific  operation\n\ncan better serve these tourists. In addition, a clear, objective  analysis  of  local  competition is  necessary  to  determine  the  segment  and genre  in  which  the  hotel  can  compete  and succeed.\n\nIf  the  hotel  is  competing  with  an  established local competitor, then the hotel foodservice operation must outdeliver on all levels of  quality, service, and  ambience. In  a  large hotel, it is also necessary not to compete directly  with  another  unit  in  the  same  hotel. Units  must  be  diverse  to  give  different  segments of the market a choice; the ideal outcome is that hotel and local guests choose to dine in one of the hotel's offerings. A strong food  and  beverage  program  that  delivers  a high-quality  product  and  experience  can  be used as a competitive advantage as well as a sales tool for the lodging facility.\n\nMany hoteliers choose not to compete in this  environment. Instead, their  strategy  is to  eliminate  food  and  beverage  operations altogether, or to lease food and beverage operations  to  outside  companies, either  chainoperated  or  an  independent  restaurant  (see the article by Strate and Rappole elsewhere in this section). In particular, food and beverage  sales  in  motels  and  motor-hotel  restaurants  continue  to  decline  as  a  percentage  of overall  sales  when  compared  to  full-service hotels, primarily  as  a  result  of  an  increasing number  of  lower-priced  lodging  operations offering  free  breakfast  and  no  other  meal service. However, that free breakfast has become a competitive positioning statement for the property. Guests now expect it, and they expect quality, yet such lodging facilities must maintain their cost structure.\n\nWhile the reader may start to think that hotel  food  services  are  not  major  players  in the  overall  foodservice  market, 2005  projected  sales  were  estimated  at  $25  billion,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naccording to the National Restaurant Association.There are five major hotel chains whose foodservice sales per hotel average more than $2.3 million. At the top lies Sheraton Hotels, whose properties average well over $4.6 million  in  foodservice  sales. It  should  be  noted that  a  number  of  convention/resort  hotels could do well over $30 million in annual food and beverage sales. Clearly, foodservice professionals have as much or more opportunity for success as in other segments of the foodservice  industry. With  potential  sales  like those  noted, lodging  food  services  remain  a critical partner with respect to both the revenue and profit of the property. A smart, resourceful  manager  makes  the  foodservice operation  unique, thus  attracting  additional patrons  to  the  lodging  establishment. Thus, foodservice can be looked on as a means of gaining  competitive  advantage  over  other lodging operations.\n\nThe field of lodging has a long history of serving  people  food  and  drink  during  their travels. From the earliest days of the Roman Empire, when people traveled on foot, on animal, or in vehicles drawn by animals, to the modern age of air, rail, and car transportation, hotels  and  inns  provided  for  their  needs. In fact, early  hotels  were  usually  the  center  of community activity and often the only place one could eat away from home. The glamour years of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced grander hotel properties, the so-designated palaces of the people, which  solidified  this  perception  of  hotels  as centers of public entertainment and as sources of food and drink for guests. This reputation continued well into the twentieth century, as  hotels  became  the  logical  place  to meet for entertainment and business discussion. Foodservice operations independent of hotels were rare even in the larger urban cen-\n\nters. It  was  not  until  the  post-World War  II era that independent restaurants and restaurant  chains  grew  in  both  number  and  influence  over  the  customer. As  we  enter  the twenty-first  century, lodging  foodservice  accounts  for  approximately  7  percent  of  the total foodservice market. From total domination of the market to its role as a secondary player today, lodging foodservice has undergone dramatic change. As properties struggle to decide whether or not to offer foodservice and, if so, the number of foodservice units and the level of service to offer, future managers must recall what the goals and mission of the foodservice operation should be:\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he organization of foodservice departments within lodging establishments varies depending on the type of facility and, in the case of chain  operations, corporate  policies. Due  to this  degree  of  variety, categorizing  lodging properties  can  be  difficult. For  example, a property located in a resort environment may also have extensive convention space.A property  known  primarily  as  a  convention  hotel has  room  enough  to  accommodate  large\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngroups. Foodservice  outlets  likely  include restaurant(s), lounge(s), banquet  facilities, and room service. A resort property provides all  the  amenities  that  focus  on  guest  entertainment  and  relaxation, with  emphasis  on specialty  restaurant(s)  and  room  service. Unique problems may face resort  managers with respect to seasonality of operations, location, and  layout. The  latter  points  are  important because the property itself, as well as individual food and beverage outlets, may be located in hard-to-access areas, which affects operational expenses.\n\nAn example of a resort is the Renaissance Sea World Resort in Orlando, Florida. David McKeever, director of restaurant operations, is  responsible  for  three  full-service  restaurants as well as banquet and conference services. David notes that his facilities aim for an upscale  perspective, highlighted  by  regional and contemporary menu influences and characterized by upscale wine sales. He identifies the  property  clientele  as  wanting  a  relaxed environment in food and beverage services.\n\nLloyd  Wentzell, vice  president  of  food and  beverage, provides  a  slightly  different view  of  these  services  at  the  Riviera  Hotel and  Casino  in  Las Vegas. He  notes  that  the food  and  beverage  operation  there  is  an amenity.The buffet and coffee shop are for inhouse guests, and the (three) gourmet rooms are  for  guests  including  those  who  come  to the  shows  at  the  hotel's  four  entertainment venues. The snack bar in Nickel Town is used to  bring  visitors  from  nearby  properties. Room service is a necessary loss leader used to maintain resort hotel status.\n\nAirport  properties  have  grown  with  the increase  in  air  travel. Quite  often, travelers choose these properties based on the convenience factor. While occupancy rates are high during weekdays, weekend business tends to drag. There does not appear to be an empha-\n\nsis  on  food and beverage operations in such facilities.\n\nEconomy properties are coming off a period of significant growth. This is the segment that  often  rejects  offering  foodservice  operations. Midscale brands such as Ramada Inn and Hampton  Inn  are  noted  for  their  aggressive growth in building new properties with little or no food services. Additionally, significant growth is expected in the lower-tier extendedstay market. However, some properties are attempting to redefine the concept of value to the customers. An example is Courtyard by Marriott, which combines comfortable lodging with downsized  foodservice  operations. All-suite properties remain one of the hottest concepts in the lodging field. While some units contain kitchen  facilities, many  offer  complimentary food  and  beverage  services-particularly  at breakfast-for the busy traveler.\n\nThe Four Seasons Hotel in Boston demonstrates  one  example  of  how  a  hotel food  and  beverage  operation  can  be  organized. The food and beverage division has four departments; food preparation, catering sales, stewarding, and  sales  outlets. The  latter  has five  operations: private bars, room service, a full-service  lounge, a  fine  dining  restaurant, and  banquet  facilities. Each  department  has line employees who report to assistant managers  who, in turn, report  to  department heads, who then report to a director of restaurants and bars, who, in turn, reports to the director  of  food  and  beverages. Regardless  of the size of the lodging facility, food and beverages  must  be  produced  and  served. However, the  increased  size  and  complexity  of some  operations  makes  it  critical  that  managers communicate well with all levels of employees. The  trend  may  be  toward  flatter organizational  structures  as  well  as  to  completely separating out certain functions of the food and beverage area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "title": "▶ FOODSERVICE PERSONNEL",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "W ho are the key people in the organization of lodging foodservice? Our attention here is on the operational players, those individuals most often responsible for the work of pleasing the guest while holding the line on costs.\n\nIn most kitchen operations, an executive chef is responsible for management related to production  activities. Depending  on  the  size and complexity of the operation, the  executive  chef  may  actually  perform  little  in  the line of food production. In a small operation, the  chef  may  also  be  a  part  owner  and  perform most of the food-related functions. One of the exciting trends today is the use of bigname  chefs  in  hotel  food  services, often  allowing them to create a signature room in the lodging  property. The  proper  positioning  of the restaurant in a niche market can also have a residual positive effect on average rate and occupancy. Marketing  a  celebrity  chef  as  a primary  component  of  a  hotel  may  yield  a competitive  advantage  among  that  specific hotel's competitive set.\n\nWith the trend toward downsizing operations, it  would  be  the  rare  organization  in lodging foodservice that employed numerous back-of-the-house  employees  engaged  in  a single  function. Some  examples  of  the  past might  include  the  sous-chef, the  executive chef's assistant and often the staff supervisor; the saucier, or sauce cook; the garde-manger, the cook in charge of all cold food preparation; the chef pâtissier, or pastry chef; and the banquet  chef  in  charge  of  catering. Each  of these positions would have had assistants. In addition, other jobs were steward, purchasing manager, storeroom clerk, and several janitorial staff.\n\nSome examples of how lodging foodser-\n\nvice is organized today have been reported in studies  of  best  practices. The  Boulders, located in Arizona, created a food forager position  to  improve  quality  of  products. Menus are  designed  around  foods  actually  located, which saves time spent trying to find ingredients to fit a menu while providing guests with a unique dining experience. The Greenbrier, in West Virginia, designed a formal three-year culinary apprentice program. This allows the resort  to  attract  a  continuous  supply  of  talented chefs as well as create a cooking school for guests (thus adding value to the guest experience). The  Pierre  in  New York  City  utilizes  an  independent  consultant  to  manage purchasing. This  frees  the  chef  to  focus  on food production and has led to reduced food and labor costs.\n\nThe  dining  room  can  have  an  equal  degree of complexity, depending on the operation. There may or may not be a supervisor, often called a host or hostess, or a maître d'. This  individual  greets  guests  and  supervises the  waitstaff. At  the  actual  service  level  are the captains, servers, bussers, and cashiers. If a lounge operation is present, so are bartenders and cocktail servers. As one can readily imagine, working as a team is imperative.\n\nIn today's cost control environment, food and  beverage  operations  are  trimming  payrolls and consolidating job responsibilities to cut  operational  expenses. This  cross-training of staff allows an individual to take on multiple  responsibilities. The  Breakers  Hotel  in Palm Beach, Florida, utilizes a cross-training program  that  allows  the  property  to  completely reorganize its staff annually, facilitating  mobility  of  staff  as  well  as  improved service  to  guests. In  the  past, it  was  not  uncommon for the food and beverage operation to employ workers around the clock, as most items were made from scratch. With modern equipment and the use of more convenience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfood items, such as preportioned meats, it is now  rare  to  find  butcher  shops  or  pastry shops  in  hotels. Again, hotel  operations  are concentrating  on  quality, value, and  cost. If the property can find a product on the market, the trend is to purchase rather than make from scratch.\n\nThere has been increased attention on the education level of chefs in lodging operations. In recent years, traditional culinary arts programs have expanded from two-year to fouryear  education  programs, while  traditional four-year  hospitality  institutions  have  expanded their curricula into culinary arts. Under  the  direction  of  the  author  (when  he served  there  as  department  chair), the  Department of Food and Beverage Management in  the  Harrah  College  of  Hotel Administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was  the  first  four-year  hotel  administration degree program to offer a bachelor of science (B.S.)  in  culinary  arts  management. People who earn this degree can command rewarding pay, but much is expected of them as well. They  must  be  able  to  produce  high-quality products  utilizing  minimal  resources. They must also direct all activities in the back of the house, including the training and supervision of  employees. Their  responsibility  is  the means by which a food and beverage unit produces  profit  for  its  parent  institution, the lodging facility.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "H otels are complex institutions divided into separate  operational  areas, among  them rooms, engineering, administrative, accounting, human resources, and sales, in addition to\n\nfood and beverage.These divisions interact in every imaginable way 24 hours a day to produce the guest experience. It is necessary that the strategy or mission of the operation as a whole be communicated to all levels of the organization to ensure a consistent guest experience. In order to maintain continuity within the organization, all strategic moves must be consistent  with  the  mission  of  the  operation and  build  toward  the  long-term  goals  of profit, quality, guest  satisfaction/loyalty, and employee retention and growth.\n\nPerhaps the best way to describe this interaction is to characterize food and beverage and  other  departments  as  mutually  dependent. Direct  interaction  can  be  observed  between food and beverage and the front desk with  respect  to  specific  guest  service  issues. Direct interaction can also be observed with the sales department and the convention/banquet  department. Indirect  interaction  between departments comes from areas such as rooms, in the form of overnight cleaning; engineering, in the form of maintenance and repair; and accounting, in the form of financial analysis. For  example, food  and  beverage team  members  must  communicate  their reservation needs or restrictions to concierge and bell staffs. One example is announcing a new menu that has been initiated, or  that  a special activity will occur. Likewise, food and beverage depends on information submitted to  them regarding occupancy, VIP guests, or demanding guests.\n\nNo matter the type of lodging property, it is  critical  for  management and staff to meet regularly  to  discuss  department  interaction and better ways to service the guests.Another example with a special case to consider is a casino resort hotel. Historically, food and beverage  has  been  perceived  as  an  amenity  for players. The casino and slot departments are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinually in contact with food and beverage units, particularly  room  service, to  request special  arrangements  for  their  clients. These requests  might  range  from  amenities  being delivered and set up in the guest room to supplying the gaming area with special foods and drinks.\n\nThe  type  of  client  sleeping  in  the  guest rooms significantly affects the revenue-generation potential of a lodging food and beverage operation. Because a majority of food and beverage customers may be hotel guests, it is important  to  book  the  right  type  of  people into the hotel. The sales mix of the hotel is a delicate balancing act. Sales staff must make sure  they  are  contracting  groups  that  maximize hotel revenue  per available room (Revpar). Do you know the utilization rate of the food and beverage outlets for the various market segments? Do business travelers eat more or drink more than the leisure/pleasure market? Which convention uses the food and beverage outlets more than others? The ballroom space must be managed closely to ensure that the best business opportunities are maximized from the rooms and food and beverage perspectives. Groups with high demand for banquet space must meet room-night obligations at a given rate and provide the necessary revenue  in catering. Local niche opportunities must be explored when there is an opportunity to sell the ballroom when hotel guests are not utilizing it. It is possible that local catering sales can be a larger portion of the  total  catering  dollars, particularly  when the rooms mix changes to a larger proportion of  transient  guests. Your  management  and sales  staff  must  know  the  answers  to  these types of questions. Sales personnel cannot just be concerned with achieving room-night quotas  or  generating  revenue; they  must  know the impact of their decisions throughout the\n\nhotel  and  how  they  affect  its  profitability. When  developing  annual  budgets, the  team must  take  into  consideration  seasonality, group business and its particular needs, transient guests, and regional events that may affect guest occupancy and mix.\n\nThe  food  and  beverage  manager  must know who the customers are and how many patrons  to  expect. Information  about  hotel guests  such  as  house  counts, market  mix  reports, group commitment reports, and rival/departure  patterns  assists  the  food  and beverage team in making decisions on scheduling, food  ordering, and  whether  or  not  to close a particular outlet.\n\nEvery hotel employee is a sales agent for the property's food and beverage outlets. The staff must be trained to refer and recommend hotel  services  to  guests. It  is  clear  that  the quality of food and beverage operations can affect overall hotel operations and profitability. Quality is particularly important for convention  hotels  and  resort  hotel  properties. Guests  come  to  such  properties  for  specific purposes. Therefore, a  reputation  as  a  highquality food and beverage operation will attract  customers. These  operations  generate word-of-mouth advertising from travel agents, corporate meeting planners, cab drivers, airline  companies, and  tourism  offices. While this reputation can attract guests, it is the responsibility of management to plan effectively for their needs.\n\nImagine you run a hotel restaurant, operate room service, provide food and beverages for employees, and now are also catering several  types  of  meals/functions  for  different groups. Recall that the goal of the hotel property is to service its clientele. Therefore, each area of the hotel must complement the other in  providing  the  service. Managers, particularly in food and beverage, must communicate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neffectively  and  train  constantly  in  order  to maximize the goals of the lodging operation.\n\n",

      "content": "M any  operating  ratios  are  utilized  by  the food  and  beverage  department. Controlling operational  expenses  is  perhaps  the  biggest challenge facing food and beverage managers. Managers at every level must be controllers. In  addition, it  is  the  duty  of  every  food  and beverage  manager  to  maximize  the  revenue and profit potential of his or her specific unit. An  empty  seat  cannot  be  resold  later. If  a restaurant has a significant drop in sales on a given day or time of year, a strategy must be developed and implemented to fill that void and thus provide a new revenue source. Most hotels' food and beverage operations have a minimum fixed cost that must be maintained in order to meet the needs of the hotel.\n\nIt is increasingly difficult to make a profit and  provide  high-quality  service  when  revenue does not support the labor necessary for even  minimum  levels. The  challenge  is  to maintain  a  strong  revenue  flow  so  that  efficiencies of scale take place. The kitchen is the highest cost producer of any part of the food and beverage operation. The challenge of the kitchen manager or chef is to deliver a highquality  product, yet  maintain  close  controls on food and labor costs.\n\nThe key for success in this area is to have a clear understanding of production management so as to reduce waste and spoilage, create  dynamic  menus  that  drive  business, and continue  to  build  an  ongoing  training  program to instill the best practices into line associates. In  very  large  establishments, the kitchen manager or chef may find himself or herself using a computer more than a knife.\n\nA number of club managers the author recently spoke with noted that operating ratios are  important  to  keep  expenses  in check, as well as to monitor improvements or  income  contributions  from  one  area  of the  property  to  another. They  identified food cost and labor cost percentages as most important. A  casino  hotel  controller  from Las Vegas  utilizes  operating  ratios  such  as cost per cover, percentage of sales, cost per employee, utilization  rate  (number  of  covers/number of guests), revenue per occupied room, sales per hotel guest, average check, sales  per  employee, table  turnover, inventory turnover, revenue per square foot, revenue per seat, cost per square foot, return on investment, covers  per  employee, average covers per day, and average sales per day. Industry  professionals  note  that  ratios  are only tools and that it is more important to have a clear idea of what needs to be measured and the impact of each variable on the overall operation.\n\nWhat  we  can  observe  is  that  food  and beverage managers utilize ratios to determine whether or not they have been successful in generating  revenues  and  minimizing  expenses. Such  ratios  can  then  be  compared with figures from prior accounting periods of that  operation. Let  us  examine  some  of  the more common ratios.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I n  presenting  trends, we  must  exercise  caution, as what works in one food and beverage operation may not in another. Recall that the goal of lodging food and beverage operations is to meet hotel guests' desires, with attention paid  to  price, value, quality, service, and  atmosphere. Food and beverage managers are wise to study similar hotel operations as well as  restaurant  operations. Guest  surveys  are also  essential  to  determining  customer  desires. Your  objective  should  be  to  discover what  customers  want  and  need  in  terms  of food and beverage products and delivery, and how your operation can better serve them.\n\nHilton  Hotels  has  added  to  its Vacation Station program. It provides children a canvas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbag  with  an  insulated  compartment  to  hold lunch or snacks, with a mesh-net drink holder on the side. Parents can order from a variety of Snack Pack selections via room service for pickup  later. Radisson  Hotels  and  Resorts teamed with a culinary school and supplier to create  a  low-carbohydrate  menu. Sheraton Hotels  has  also  introduced  a  Lo-Carb  Lifestyle  program  in  its  restaurants, banquets, room service, lounges, and to-go snacks.\n\nHoliday Inn Hotels and Resorts is testing use of a wireless electronic menu that allows a customer to view a list of options updated in real time. The consumer can find related nutritional  information  while  searching  for  information  about  the  hotel  itself. Also  in  an experimental  phase  is  their  new  prototype restaurant, Kem's  Café, named  for  founder Kemmons Wilson. Guests can use the e-menu to order from a choice of comfort food.\n\nBack  at  the  Breakers  Hotel  in  Palm Beach, management renovated their existing formal  dining  and  casual  dining  restaurants, developing single-theme outlets to give guests choice of cuisine rather than choice dictated by guest attire. This has led to stronger hotel restaurant identities and an increased capture rate. Peacock Alley  in  New York's WaldorfAstoria  Hotel  replaced  appetizers  and  main courses with a variety of dishes of in-between portion  sizes  and  added  more  wines  by  the glass  and  half-bottle  to  complement  the  expanded  possibilities  of  the  new  menu. This version  of  a  tasting  menu  was  developed  in response  to  diners, who  kept  substituting dishes from the regular menu.\n\nThe concept of branding has also affected hotel  food  and  beverage  operations. For  example, Country  Inns  and  Suites  has  cobranded with established restaurant concepts (see Chapter 6.5 by Strate and Rappole). The restaurants average approximately 20 percent\n\nof  their  business  from  hotel  guests, and  this cooperative arrangement eliminates the capital cost of building a restaurant on site.Westin has teamed with established steakhouse chain operators The Palm and Shula's Steak House in  its  properties. Doubletree  also  developed specialty steakhouses, but with their own proprietary concept, Spencer's.\n\nAnother  example  of  branding  your  own concept  comes  from  the  Riviera  Hotel  and Casino.They created Hound Doggies as an outlet that targets the walking traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard  (the  Strip). The  location  is  only  a few  steps  off  the  sidewalk  and  has  been  successful  in  drawing  nonstaying  guests  into  the property. They implemented this concept only after studies identified walking traffic as a potential market.The goal for the outlet was quite basic: Bring  people  in  the  door. Through  the use of a 1950s theme,high-quality food,and low prices, the Riviera has exceeded its expectation of nonstaying guests. As the unit was not created  specifically  as  a  revenue-generating  center, success is measured by its impact in other areas, such as increased slot play.\n\nSome  Four  Seasons  Hotels  and  Regent Hotels and Resorts are promoting the strategic  use  of  a  single  food  and  beverage  outlet coordinated  with  the  concept  of  cuisine choices. This strategy has resulted in a more focused  approach. In  properties  where  it  is implemented, the strategy has resulted in significant capture rates as well as increasing local traffic (nonstaying guests).\n\nOne of the more exciting trends in lodging foodservice  operations  is  in  hotel  beverage operations, specifically  hotel  bars. In  many large-city  properties, hotel  operators  have found such facilities to be considerable moneymakers-as much as 50 percent bar profit margin. These  bar  operations  are  clearly driven by the youth and vitality of the new In-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nternet, or millennial, generation. The bars are seen as lively gathering places where business and personal time merge. Lodging chains are taking  notice  of  such  activity. Starwood  purchased a stake in a company that initiated a popular bar chain. Even the names of the bar operations  reflect  a  youthful  vitality  associated with the location: Whiskey Blue, Skybar, and Whiskey Rocks. One concern associated with these bar operations can be their impact on traditional hotel guests. Many outsourced bar  operations  do  not  extend  traditional amenities to lodging guests, such as billing to room, preferred  seating, and  even  reservations. In fact, the clientele of the bar may be quite different from the hotel guest.\n\nIn order for your lodging food and beverage  operation  to  succeed, sound  marketing and  keen  observation  of  what  people  want must  accompany  high-quality  food  and  service. While consumers choose your hotel for specific reasons, such as price or service, they seek more creativity in a food and beverage operation. If you  cannot  attract  the  hotel guest, you  will  find  that  attracting  clientele from  the  local  area  is  also  difficult. Quite likely, each  hotel  has  its  own  character  that suggests a variation of food and beverage operations in different markets. Management is wise to remember that a food and beverage unit in a hotel serves the interests of the hotel as well as its own.\n\nWhile some limited-service lodging operations have entered into cooperative relationships with foodservice companies, the concept holds significant potential for the appropriate market. One  example  is  where  the  hotel's foodservice operation is marginal at best. The lodging  property  can  concentrate  its  resources on rooms and lease the food and beverage service to an identifiable brand. Hotels should be aware, though, that restaurant com-\n\npanies, for  example, might  not  be  familiar with room service or catering. In an extreme case of moving away from foodservice, some lodging  properties  limit  services  to  in-room minibars  and  microwaves, with  limited  food items available for sale in the gift shop. The gift shop may even be transformed into a convenience store.\n\nWe have  observed  that  some  properties sense a rebirth of simplicity in food and beverage operations. A good example is a coffee shop. Over the last ten years, the coffee shop concept  has  been  abandoned  in  favor  of higher-priced  dining. But  in  letting  a  coffee shop be a coffee shop, you tap into the consumer's  consciousness  of  value  as  well  as menu  variety  and  fast  service. While  some find the concept boring, consumers often seek the comfort of knowing they can get a good meal  at  a  good  price  day  after  day  in  your operation.\n\nRoom  service  is  also  seeing  significant changes. In  some  properties, the  concept  of room  service  has  been  eliminated, while  in others  it  has  been  revived. For  example, menus are limited to particular concepts, such as pizza or Asian food. Food items are packaged to appear as though they came from a freestanding  restaurant. In  some  cases, the lodging property has an agreement with a local  restaurant  to  provide  the  room  service. Some lodging  properties  even  list  the  room service phone number under the name of the food item (for example, pizza).The key, again, is  to  know  your  clientele. But  the  move  to simpler menus, accompanied by lower prices, could bring room service back as a major contributor  to  overall  operations. Some  larger hotel  operations  are  focusing  on  a  tighter menu  and  faster  service  through  room  service. For example, one property has converted a freight elevator into a mobile kitchen unit,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthereby allowing service delivery within minutes of an order.While this option may not be possible  for  all  hotels, it again  points  out knowing what to offer your specific clientele. Room service has seen a resurgence in certain lodging  properties, primarily  as  a  result  of guest lifestyle. With more adults working and engaged  in  active  lifestyles, convenience and  accessibility  become  paramount. Room service  fits  the  criteria  of  convenience  and accessibility.\n\n",

      "content": "A s you can see from the foregoing discussion, it  can  be  difficult  to  pinpoint  which  trends may be most important to any individual hotel. What we can say is some lodging properties, notably  chain  properties  and  large-size properties, seem  to  be  differentiating  themselves  to  provide  excitement  for  their  food and beverage clientele. These operations are essentially reinventing themselves in order to keep fresh and provide creative food and beverage opportunities for staff and guests.These operations view foodservice as integral to the overall success of the lodging operation.\n\nOn  the  other  hand, we  can  also  see  a trend  toward  reduced  or  even  nonexistent foodservice, primarily  in  smaller  properties and  the  lower-end  chain  lodging  properties. These  operations  view  their  business  as strictly lodging  and  leave  foodservice  to someone  else, now  often  a  well-known  national brand restaurant.\n\nIt  should  be  obvious  from  reading  this overview that an emphasis on cost control is likely a key strategy for lodging foodservices. With increased competition from other foodservice operations, hotels are finding it more difficult  to  generate  revenues  and  increase customer counts. Attention to value and service  is  of  significant  concern  to  consumers. Managers of lodging foodservice must utilize better control tools, such as sound forecasting techniques  and  menu  analysis. Banquets, catering, and room service hold the most potential for profit generation in lodging foodservice. These  functions  allow  management the best opportunity for accurate forecasting and staffing. Beverage areas, such as lounges, continue to be profitable despite a trend toward  less  alcohol  consumption  throughout the population.\n\nThe probability of producing profit in hotel restaurants depends on their type and size. There  is  no  reason  why  a  hotel  cannot  do well, but attention to detail is often lacking in some operations. It is clear that lodging foodservice offers managers unique challenges in the  dynamic  world  of  foodservice  management. Food and beverage operations may not be  the  major  focus  in  a  lodging  property. However, they  may  have  significant  impact on the customer's perception of the quality of the entire property. Therefore, food and beverage  operations  in  lodging  properties  can serve  to  differentiate  top  performers  in  the crowded  lodging  market  and  enhance  guest loyalty for the specific property.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Judy A. Siguaw and Cathy A. Enz\n\nOne critical attribute of successful hotel food and beverage outlets is their ability to appropriately respond to the changing needs of the market while maintaining a profitable operation. Yet few hotel food and beverage outlets excel  at  this  fundamental  strategy. Instead, generic  restaurants  that  provide  undistinguished menu items and offer guests a poor value-for-money proposition frequently characterize hotel food service. Such hotel restaurants fail to provide menu choices, ambience, or  service  desired  by  the  dining-out  market (let  alone  their  guests), and  therefore  they frequently operate at a loss. Indeed, some analysts have declared that hotel restaurants by their nature will lose money (Hanson, 1984).\n\nRecently, as  part  of  a  large, comprehensive  study  on  best  practices  in  the  United States lodging industry conducted by Cornell University's  School  of  Hotel Administration (Dubé et al., 1999), we identified a group of best-practice  food  and  beverage  champions that  had  developed  practices  to  successfully\n\naccomplish the strategic charge of profitably meeting  customer  needs. The  champions  selected  via  an  intense  screening  process  are The Boulders, The Breakers, Country Inns & Suites, Four Seasons & Regent Hotels & Resorts, The Greenbrier, Hyatt Arlington Hotel, The  Pierre, Walt  Disney World  Resorts  and Theme Parks,The Waldorf-Astoria, and Wyndham  Hotels  and  Resorts  (see  Table  6.1). Through their best practices, this select group demonstrates  the  capability  of  executing the strategic mandate of making money while responding to the needs of their target markets  through  revitalized  food  and  beverage operations.\n\nIn the following pages we first present the several practices that have been used by our food  and  beverage  champions  to  provide their  outlets  with  a  competitive  advantage. We then examine the measures of success and report the advice our champions give others on how to prosper with hotel food and beverage service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 6.1 Overview of Food and Beverage Best-Practice Champions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "title": "▶ FOCUS ON PRODUCT QUALITY",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he  problem for The Boulders was that the variety and quality of the produce it was obtaining were not up to the resort's high standards. As  a  result, the  food  and  beverage department's  culinary  passion  seemed  to  be declining  along  with  the  quality  of  the  food ingredients. The  resort's  management  responded by creating the position of food forager, who initially focused on buying high-quality produce locally (i.e., in Arizona). Later, though, the  forager  traveled  farther afield and took on the additional responsibil-\n\nities  of  purchasing  spices, shellfish, cheeses, and  meats. To  keep  the  kitchen  apprised  of what items are coming, the forager uses a hotline to report expected delivery dates and expenditures. The  Boulders'  chefs  then  adjust menus based on the incoming items. Consequently, the food ingredients are of the highest quality, and the chefs have the chance to experiment  with  a  continuously  changing menu.\n\nAlso seeking to instill a passion for food and beverage, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts designed its 'Best of Class' program, with the overall  objective  of  making  Wyndham  a leader in food and beverage innovation, quality, and service. The Best of Class was a wide-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nranging effort that involved both sides of the house. The chain:\n\nTo deliver high-quality food and beverage products to its guests, Country Inns & Suites chose to develop a cobranding strategy with\n\nrestaurant brands that are co-owned by Carlson but freestanding, primarily T.G.I. Friday's or  Italiani's. This  practice  ensures  the  guest access  to  a  high-quality, brand-name  restaurant on site, but it eliminates the capital cost of building a generic restaurant in the hotel. While the core concept of locating a limitedservice  hotel  adjacent  to  a  restaurant  is  not new, Carlson's approach to the strategy is innovative, since it owns all the brands (another brand that expressly pursued a strategy of locating  next  to  restaurants  in  the  1980s  was Days  Inns). To  implement  this  cobranding strategy, Carlson  seeks  a  large, 'A' location that will support the restaurant, which is built at the forefront of the property for visibility. Both  the  restaurant  and  hotel  benefit  from this arrangement.\n\nThe goal of Four Seasons hotels is to be rated as having one of a given city's top three restaurants. To achieve this goal the chain offers a single restaurant in its hotels-but that restaurant  has  two  dining  rooms, one  more formal and one less formal.Thus, with a single F&B  outlet  the  hotel  can  offer  two  dining rooms that differ in design, but that share the same  menu, chefs, line  cooks, and  kitchens. Compared to having multiple outlets, this approach allows its F&B staff members to provide  greater  attention  to  food  quality  and presentation, to focus on small details, and to deliver higher service levels via a small, highly qualified  staff. In  response  to  guests'  stated desire for alternatives to a heavy, meat-based cuisine, Four Seasons has broadened its menu choices  to  include  its  trademark Alternative Cuisine, comprising  a  nutritionally  balanced menu of alternative meals, vegetarian dishes, and homestyle preparations. Alternative Cuisine items are low in fat, cholesterol, sodium, and  calories to correspond  with  guests'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngreater  interest  in  health  and  fitness. Similarly, vegetarian  recipes  have  been  added  to the menu in response to an increased trend of vegetarianism among guests. Homestyle recipes, on the other hand, are just what the name implies: they have been developed from the  chefs'  favorite  family  recipes. The  latter cuisine  choice  suits  travel-weary  guests  who wish for a homecooked meal.\n\nThe  Greenbrier  has  instituted  several practices  to  establish  itself  as  a  center  for culinary excellence.The resort had to address two major problems, both of which stemmed from its remote location. First, for a time the resort  was  having  difficulty  attracting  and retaining  experienced  culinary  personnel. To  end  a  constant  cycle  of  recruiting  and training  workers  and  to  improve  the  food product being offered to guests, The Greenbrier established a three-year culinaryapprenticeship  program. The  resort  recruits candidates from principal culinary schools in the United States to complete an apprenticeship in all areas of the kitchens, as well as attend  classes. Because  the  program  runs  for three years, the apprenticeship has helped to stabilize  the  kitchen  staff. Further  stability comes from an agreement with the local high school by which the resort will provide permanent  employment  to  interested  students. The second problem is attracting guests during  shoulder  and  off-season  times. Continuing with its theme of culinary education, The Greenbrier  established  cooking  classes  for guests and promoted symposiums conducted by food critics and writers.The Greenbrier issues a quarterly newsletter to 600,000 guests and has published The Greenbrier Cookbook to  further  identify  the  resort  as  a  culinary center-and to remain in contact with potential guests.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he  common  thread  of  the  following  cases that feature restaurant redesign is that the existing  restaurants  were  operated  in  a  functionally  competent  fashion. They  had  lost their competitive spark, however (or stood in danger  of  doing  so), because  of  changes  in guests'  preferences. In  response, operators took a lead from freestanding restaurants and focused tightly on customers' current wishes for theme-based casual dining.\n\nThe Breakers recognized that the public has long had an aversion to hotel restaurants, which stems from the days when hotel restaurants  tried  to  have  some  of  every  variety  of food they thought a guest might desire-none of  it  particularly  distinguished  and  all  of  it seemingly overpriced. In response to guests' negative  feelings  about  hotel  restaurants, many  hotels  have  dropped  food  service  entirely, but this option is not open to a five-star hotel  or  resort. Instead, The  Breakers  chose to create its own strong restaurant identities through  single-theme  outlets  that  replaced the resort's existing formal- and casual-dining restaurants  and  bars. The  practice  not  only helped The Breakers change the public perception  of  hotel  restaurants, but  it  allowed guests  to  choose  their  cuisine  according  to what  they  wanted  to  eat, rather  than  what they  wanted  to  wear. Thus, the  resort's  oldfashioned formal dining room became a modern, Florentine-style gourmet restaurant. The owners  converted  the  former  casual  dining room to a top-caliber steak house-with ambience to match. Perhaps most strikingly, the resort  converted  its  main  bar  and  lounge,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhich  had  virtually  no  business  during  the day, to a beautiful ocean-side seafood restaurant. The former Victorian restaurant became a Southern Italian-style pasta house, and the Beach Club was converted to a French Riviera-style restaurant.Thus, the resort now has five restaurants that feature their own distinctive  decor  and  ambience, without  a  loss  in food quality.\n\nThe food and beverage outlets of the Hyatt  Arlington  Hotel  similarly  had  lost  their customer appeal because of their dated concept and design. After the hotel undertook a comprehensive  market-research  study, the hotel's managers selected a restaurant theme that blends contemporary (postmodern) and Mediterranean  concepts. In  developing  the new  theme, the  hotel  replaced  the  restaurant's outer wall with floor-to-ceiling windows to transform the previously dark and unimaginative restaurant into a sun-drenched venue splashed with the Mediterranean's vivid colors. To  complement  the  new  restaurant, the hotel installed a quintessential martini bar.\n\nWalt  Disney  World  Resorts  and  Theme Parks has long recognized the value of themes to a guest's experience-not only in its parks, but  also  in  its  many  restaurants. Consequently,WDW set out to create a 'touchable' foodservice  experience  for  the  guest  that combines design, decor, ambience, food, service, and  entertainment  in  such  a  way  as  to stimulate all of the senses, not just the palate. The  idea  is  to  'offer  a  personal  experience which  is  highly  customized, memorable, and judged by our guests to be worth the price,' remarked  Dieter  Hannig, vice  president  of F&B.\n\nWith  more  than  500  theme  food-andbeverage  outlets, WDW's  managers  realized that a restaurant's design is crucial to provid-\n\ning the 'touchable' experience for the guest. Each restaurant is designed to be as thematically authentic as possible so that all elements of  the  physical  facility  and  operations  combine to transport the guest to another setting, country, or culture.The dining adventure is intended to produce the feelings, tastes, sounds, and excitement the guest would experience at the  actual  locale  being  replicated. Access  to the restaurants is designed to be easy and uncomplicated. Accordingly, many  restaurants are freestanding so that guests do not have to walk  into  hotel  lobbies  or  down  corridors. Further, line-level employees are empowered to  make decisions to improve service recovery and ensure a great dining experience for the guest.\n\n",

      "content": "O ur last two champions focused on costs and revenues in the food and beverage arena.The Pierre  focused  on  upgrading  its  restaurant's purchasing function-that is, setting specifications, selecting vendors, obtaining best prices, and  monitoring  receiving. However, The Pierre's management was concerned that controlling purchasing activities would divert the executive chef's attention from the kitchen's culinary creations.To allow the executive chef to focus on the menu the hotel delegated financial responsibility for food purchasing to an independent consultant, who worked with the chefs to develop specifications for all food products. The  consultant  analyzes  available foodstuffs  and  may  recommend  changing specifications if a less expensive item can be substituted  without  comprising  quality  or when  off-site  preparation  would  be  equally good  but  less  expensive  than  preparing  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfood item on site. The consultant also trained kitchen employees to adhere to strict receiving standards. Most important to cost control, the consultant negotiated contracts with each vendor specifying that the vendor would earn a given percentage profit over its cost. (Some existing  vendors  may  have  blanched  at  this proposal, but most signed on to keep the hotel's business.) To ensure that costs are in line and  that  vendors  are  fulfilling  their  agreements, the consultant regularly audits inventory  and  cost  lists  from  each  vendor  and annually audits the vendors' books to verify that  the  vendors  are  accurately  stating  the cost of each item.\n\nThe Waldorf-Astoria's  management  also believed that the revenue potential of the hotel's  foodservice  operations  was  not  being achieved, but  they  looked  beyond  cost  controls. Instead, the hotel took several steps to boost  F&B  revenue-instituting  a  revenue management  program, implementing  costcutting  measures, training  chefs  to  schedule employees more efficiently, and repositioning F&B outlets to attract guests from outside the hotel. The hotel created a marketing position to coordinate the marketing efforts of all food and  beverage  units  and  to  help  implement revenue-maximization efforts. Service recovery systems were improved.The hotel trained line employees on wines to improve their efforts  in  selling  and  serving  wines. A  new restaurant  reservations  system  was  introduced to improve dining-room use, cut telephone use in restaurants, and improve communication with guests. Lastly, a diningout  program, which  allowed  servers  and kitchen employees to dine in various WaldorfAstoria restaurants, generated many ideas for improvement and created an increased awareness of food and service quality.\n\n",

The  food  forager  program  at The  Boulders, for instance, improved the quality of the food and lowered food costs. With new and interesting  foodstuffs, the  chefs  have  developed distinctive menus  that  allowed  price  increases-boosting average checks and profits. As  a  result  of  the  increased  average  check, waitstaff  gratuities  are  higher  and  employee turnover  has  been  reduced. The  resort  also implemented menu meetings in which chefs explain  their  creations  to  servers. Chefs  are once  again  passionate  about  their  creations, and the meetings have created a greater rapport between the front and back of the house.\n\nWyndham's 'Best of Class' program also reenergized the chain's F&B culture-resulting in a 15 percent increase in total sales and a 40 percent increase in wine sales. Since costs were  controlled  as  part  of  the  program, the hotels enjoy a 55 percent profit flow-through on  the  newly  generated  revenue. As  at The Boulders, Wyndham's higher average checks have  increased  staff  earnings  and  improved retention. In addition, the promotion of highquality food has upgraded the chain's overall image.\n\nAt The Breakers the new theme restaurants have increased F&B revenue by 70 percent over the last four years, with much of the growth being fueled by the substantial amount of local business attracted by the new outlets. Likewise, the  Hyatt Arlington  Hotel has doubled cover counts and revenues since its  restaurant  renovation, and the restaurant receives rave reviews.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "Robert W. Strate and Clinton L. Rappole\n\nOver the years  hotel  restaurants  have  often been managed as a secondary function of the hotel-that is, as a costly amenity rather than a revenue center. In part because of the high cost  structure  of  hotel  restaurants, which means  high  prices  relative  to  other  restaurants, they  developed  among  potential  customers  a  reputation  for  being  a  poor  value, offering indifferent service and inferior food. Today, however, many  hotel  companies  are rethinking how to integrate food and beverage  services  into  lodging  facilities. In  the process of doing so, hotel owners and operators  are  asking  at  least  four  key  questions about their property-level F&B service.\n\nTwo  results  of  owners'  and  operators' new focus on hotel food service are that (1) innovative hotel F&B concepts are being created, and (2) strategic alliances are being established  between  well-known  brand-name hotel and restaurant companies.\n\nThe primary focus of this article is to answer the four questions stated above and provide the basic decision-making framework for\n\nmatching the correct F&B concept to the target market  for  which  the  hotel  has  been  positioned. We will identify key criteria for establishing  a  seamless  partnership  between  the hotel and the restaurant. The results of such a marriage should be an improved property image  overall, enhanced  customer  value, increased revenues, and a competitive edge.

There are at least five reasons for this. An alliance may:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne of the first branded restaurant concepts to operate in hotels was probably Trader Vic's, founded by Victor Bergen in 1937. By 1949 Western Hotels (which became Westin) integrated  Trader  Vic's  into  13  hotel-based restaurants in nine countries (Withiam, 1995a, 14). Other chains also hosted the restaurants and today, 60 years later, Trader Vic's still operates  in  such  hotels  as  the  Beverly  Hilton, the  Palmer  House  (Chicago), the  Marriott Royal Garden Riverside (Bangkok), and the New  Otani  properties  in  Tokyo  and  Singapore. Ruth's  Chris  Steakhouse  is  another example of a popular restaurant brand operating  successfully  in  unison  with  hotels, including properties operated by Hilton, Marriott, Holiday Inn, and Westin.\n\nDespite  the  evidence  of  successful  al-\n\nliances between brand-name hotel and restaurant  companies, most hotel companies manage their own food and beverage services, including those that also host Trader Vic's. In part that approach reflects the long industry tradition of offering travelers both food and lodging. The Marriott Corporation is a good example of a hotel company that has used this strategy of going it alone. John Randall, Marriott  senior  director  of  food  and  beverage concepts, states  that  it  is  Marriott's  primary strategy  to  'completely  manage  our  own F&B  services  to  provide  food, service, and quality  consistency  from  property  to  property' (Hensdill, 1996).\n\nThe  strategy  of  developing  their  own F&B concepts has not been successful for all hotel companies. This is evident from the fre-\n\nTable 6.3 Hotel and Restaurant Company Strategic Alliances\n\n*The relationship between Radisson Hospitality Worldwide and Carlson Hospitality is not an alliance per se but rather an example of a hotel company that owns and has vertically integrated both its lodging and foodservice products into one corporation.\n\nSources: See 'Restaurant Chains Partner with Hotels to Satisfy Different Needs, Tastes,' Lodging, September 1995, pp. 1, 8-9; 'Holiday Inn Offers Assorted Food Options with New Quick Food Concept,' Hotel Business, June 1996, p. 9; 'Holiday Inn Offers Convenience Court Concept,' Nation's Restaurant News, May 1996, p. 208; Frank H.

A hotel might run a lounge one year, convert it into a brasserie the next year, and later decide to make it a grill. The end result is inconsistency in F&B service and quality, and  therefore  low  sales  and  profits (Parseghian, 1996). Several factors may contribute to a general manager's believing that she  or  he  can  operate  the  hotel's  restaurant services  better  than  a  branded  restaurant company, not  the  least  of  which  may  be  a sense  of  self-assurance. Some  hotel  general managers want to prove that they can provide a  fine-dining  experience  whether  or  not  a market actually exists. Others say it is because some hotel F&B operations continue to try to be all things to all people rather than providing a product that is affordable and matches customer  expectations  (Wolff, 1995, 24). Moreover, hotel restaurants in general have a high cost structure relative to the freestanding  F&B  operation  down  the  street. Hotel restaurants have to contribute to the overall property's expenses while the restaurant next door has little capital expense and is probably just leasing square footage.\n\nA current trend among hotels that have reevaluated  their  F&B  operations  is  to  replace the formal fine-dining, white-tablecloth concept with a more casual and relaxed dining experience (Allen, 1996; Liberson, 1996). Another trend indicates that more and more hotel  companies  are  looking  to  establish strategic  alliances  with  brand-name  restaurant companies. Doing this has allowed hotel companies to focus on managing the hotel itself. Listed in Table 6.3 are examples of strategic  alliances  between  hotel  and  restaurant companies. These  examples  illustrate  that some of the largest hotel companies have already established strategic alliances with major restaurant chains.\n\n",

Before creating the alliance with Good Eats Grill, the  Bristol  Hotel  Company's  primary F&B strategy was to use its own internally developed restaurant brands. This is a strategy that  has  worked  well  for  Bristol-for  example, eight outlets produced 32.4 percent F&B profit margins in 1995, and 20 out of 22 Bristol  hotel-restaurants  continue  to  use  their own internally developed restaurant brands.\n\nDespite the success of Bristol's own F&B operations, the firm decided to link two of its properties  (Holiday  Inns  in  Jackson, Mississippi, and Houston, Texas) with a franchised restaurant  brand  called  Good  Eats  Grill-a concept developed by Gene Street, who also developed  the  Black  Eyed  Pea  and  Dixie House restaurant brands. We wondered why Bristol  deviated  from  its  successful  formula, and so we decided to investigate why the Bristol Hotel  Company  elected  to  team  with Good Eats Grill.

The  basic  concept  behind  such  so-called branding is to establish a standard on which consumers  may  rely  to  predict  value  (e.g.,\n\nprice, quality, convenience).Within the hotel industry a multitiered branding strategy has evolved among lodging companies. The following  table  illustrates  how  some  hotel brands have become associated with different tiers. Note that some companies have developed products for more than one tier.\n\nSource: Ron N. Nykiel, 'Corporate Strategy within the Hospitality Industry,' in The Complete Travel Marketing Handbook, ed. Andrew Vladimir (Lincolnwood, IL: NTC Business Books, 1988).\n\nAn  example  of  the  multiple-branding strategy can be illustrated by examining the different hotel brands of the Marriott Corporation. Marriott  has  developed  Marriott Hotels, Marriott Resorts, Marriott Marquis,\n\nBristol Hotel Company. The Bristol Hotel Company is a 39-property chain with corporate headquarters in Dallas, Texas. In January 1995 Bristol acquired a Memphis-based hotel company, United Inns, Inc., that had 26 hotels based in six states. By the end of 1995 Bristol Hotel Company had grown from 8 to 38 properties  with  more  than  10,000  rooms, which\n\ngenerated  $192  million  in  total  revenues. (Many of the properties acquired in 1995 required renovation, and many of these rooms were out of order, which negatively affected year-end  1995  financial  numbers.)  The  revenues predicted for 1996 are around $250 million. The  following  key  indices  summarize Bristol Hotel Company's performance in 1995:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCourtyard by Marriott, Marriott Suites, Residence Inns, and Embassy Suites.\n\nA  somewhat  similar  branding  strategy also  exists  in  the  restaurant  industry, as shown in the following chart.\n\nThe Country Hospitality Partnership, a subsidiary  of  Carlson  Hospitality  Worldwide, is an example of a restaurant company with  a  multitier  branding  strategy. The Country Hospitality Partnership restaurants include Country Kitchen (252 restaurants), T.G.I. Friday's  (365  restaurants), Italiani's (14  restaurants), and  Front  Row  Sports Grille (3 restaurants). Additionally, Carlson provides a good example of a hotel company that owns and has vertically integrated both the  hotel  and  the  restaurant  product  into one  corporation. Carlson  Companies, Inc., owns both Radisson Hotels Worldwide and Country Hospitality Partnership. The T.G.I. Friday's  concept  is  being  integrated  into many  Radisson  Hotels  (see: Laura  Koss-\n\nBristol primarily uses an owner-operator\n\nFeder, 'Radisson  Seeks  Marketing Advantages,' Hotel & Motel Mangement, pp. 3, 43; Ron  Ruggles, 'T.G.I.

The  key  point  is  that  the brand  is  recognizable, and  this  recognition equates  to  reliable  value  from  the  customer's  perspective. This  enhanced  customer perception can be used by a firm to gain  a  competitive  edge  and, in  turn, increase revenues and profits for the company.\n\nstrategy  versus  management  contracts  in managing  its  hotels. As  of  the  time  of  our study  it  owned  36  of  its  properties  (93  percent) and managed the other three properties. Bristol's primary focus was in the full-service segment, with  35  full-service  properties  (89 percent) and only four limited-service properties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIts  primary  target  market  is  the  mid-  to upper-level corporate traveler (the source of 90 percent of the company's revenues). It also does  substantial group-meeting  business. Bristol is anticipating that full-service hotels will play an important role in meeting the future  lodging  and  business  demand  of  those two market segments. John Beckert, the chief operating  officer  of  Bristol, considers  the 'full-service  segment  as  a  segment  that  has been somewhat abandoned, but Bristol considers the segment to be 'solid' as far as demand (anticipate 6 to 10 percent increase in demand)  and  a  segment  that  allows  for greater pricing power.'\n\nBristol's overall strategy is to provide customers  with  a  first-class-hotel  experiencebut without being stuffy-and extraordinary overall value (price and quality). While those goals are not unusual among hotel companies, Bristol  has  distinguished  itself  in  several ways. First, it has an excellent track record, es-\n\ntablished in part by achieving strong operating and financial results during the industry's recent recession.\n\nSecond, it maintains a distinct corporate culture and management style that translates into low executive-management turnover.\n\nThird, its  centralized  management  structure allows managers to focus on the quality of a guest's stay as the number-one priority.\n\nThe company's primary operating strategies are listed in Table 6.4.\n\nThroughout  our  discussion  we  will  analyze  Bristol's  six  operating  strategies. However, our emphasis will be on understanding why  Bristol  Hotel  Company  aligns  its  F&B services within their hotels in a certain fashion and how it reaches the decision to do so one way instead of another.\n\nAmong its 39 hotels Bristol has 22 hotel restaurant  outlets  and  uses  three  internally developed  restaurant  brands  in  20  of  those properties, as shown in Table 6.5.\n\nTable 6.4 Bristol Hotel Company Operating StrategiesSource: Bristol Hotel Company 1995 Annual Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 6.5 Bristol' s Own Restaurant Brands\n\nIn  addition  to  Bristol's  own  restaurant concepts and the two franchised Good Eats Grills  previously  mentioned, Bristol  executives are  considering  leasing  space  to  a branded  restaurant  in  two  of  their  limitedservice properties.\n\nGood  Eats  Grill. The  Good  Eats  Grill Company  is  a  privately  held  firm  that  currently  has  17  restaurant  outlets, of  which  16 are  located  in  Texas  and  another  in  Mississippi. Four  of  the  17  restaurant  outlets  are franchised, while  the  others  are  owned  and operated by the company founder, owner, and president, Gene  Street. Bristol  Hotel  Company  is  the  only  hotel  company  that  is  currently  allied  with  Good  Eats  Grill. In  1995 Good Eats Grill's annual revenues were $23 million. Good  Eats  Grill  is  a  casual, family restaurant  stressing  food  quality  and  low price. A Good Eats Grill can seat 150 to 200 diners, serves  lunch  and  dinner, has  a  comfortable decor and casual atmosphere, and offers  excellent  food  quality  at  an  affordable price. Good  Eats  Grill's  best-selling  entrees are  its chicken-fried  steak  and  vegetable\n\nplate. The  approximate  square  footage  required for a Good Eats Grill is 4,000 to 6,500 square feet (includes both front and back of the house).\n\nThe  following  key  indices  summarize Good Eats Grill's 1995 performance:\n\nTable 6.6 summarizes the Good Eats Grill menu.\n\nAt  the  time  of  this  writing, Good  Eats Grill was doing business with no other hotel company besides the Bristol Hotel Company. We  wondered  why, and  asked  key  people within the Good Eats Grill management why they had agreed to team with Bristol Hotels. The key factors from the perspective of those managers were:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGood Eats Grill executives believe more hotel-and-restaurant  alliances  are  imminent and such deals represent a trend that is here to  stay. Good  Eats  Grill's  management  expects  to  do  more  restaurant-franchise  deals with hotel companies as doing so offers a viable option for expanding quickly without intensive capital requirements.\n\nProperty  location. For  our  study  we  selected  the  Holiday  Inn  Intercontinental, a Bristol Hotel Company property located near the  Houston  Intercontinental Airport. From the outside, the Good Eats Grill appears as if\n\nit  is  a  freestanding  restaurant, but  in  reality the restaurant is as much a part of the hotel as the lobby.\n\nThis  particular  Holiday  Inn, a  400-room property opened in 1971, recently underwent $11.5  million  in  renovations  (of  which  some $1.5 million was for the conversion of the previous restaurant into a Good Eats Grill). This hotel generates approximately $7.5 million in room revenues, operates at an 85-percent occupancy level, and has an average daily rate of $60 and RevPAR of $48. Restaurant revenues are targeted to be approximately $1.5 million; food profit, 25 percent; beverage profit, 55 to 60  percent; food  cost, 28  to  29  percent; and beverage cost, 20 to 22 percent.\n\nProperty selection. During 1995, the year Bristol  acquired  the  United  Inns  properties, Bristol Hotel Company executives evaluated all of their hotel-restaurant outlets and made decisions as to which restaurant concept best supported the targeted positioning of each individual hotel. Among Bristol's development strategies was a decision to use the Good Eats Grill concept in two of its properties. Just as\n\nTable 6.6 Good Eats Grill Menu\n\nSource: 'Ride the Branding Wave,' Lodging, September 1996, pp. 62-73.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe  asked  the  Good  Eats  Grill  executives, 'Why Bristol?' we asked Bristol executives, 'Why the decision to go with Good Eats Grill versus  going  with  proven  internally  developed restaurant brands or renovating the existing restaurant?' The key element in Bristol's selection of Good Eats Grill for two new locations was in Bristol's overall assessment  of  which  restaurant  concept  would  be the best match for the repositioning strategies for those specific hotels.\n\nAt the Houston Holiday Inn Intercontinental, the  existing  restaurant, the  Grand Cargo  Cafe, was  a  typical  hotel  restaurant with  a  coffee-shop  feel. The  Grand  Cargo Cafe  had  average  food  quality  and  service, low profit margins (5 percent), low sales volume, high  employee  turnover, little name recognition, and a below-average reputation among those customers familiar with the operation. In short, the Grand Cargo Cafe was a costly amenity for the hotel's previous owners and  Bristol  executives  quickly  determined that a change was required.\n\nBristol first looked at the possibility of replacing  the  Grand  Cargo  Cafe  with  one  of Bristol's own internally developed F&B concepts (i.e., Bristol Bar & Grill, Scoops Diner, or Remmington's). After some consideration it was determined that Bristol's own concepts did  not  adequately  complement  the  property's  repositioning strategy. The Bristol Bar & Grill is a quick-and-friendly self-serve concept that is primarily focused on serving hotel guests (i.e., banquet guests). Such a foodservice arrangement would be inappropriate for the  repositioned  Holiday  Inn  Intercontinental, which has a large sales-volume potential comprising both walk-in diners (85 percent of the  lunch  trade  and  40  percent  for  dinner) and overnight guests (15 percent at lunch and 60 percent at dinner).\n\nAnother objective in replacing the Grand Cargo  Cafe  was  to  change  dramatically  the perceived atmosphere of the outlet from that of  a  coffee  shop  to  a  substantial  restaurant. Bristol's Remmington's concept, also reminiscent of a coffee shop but more upscale than Grand Cargo Cafe in price and quality, was not considered sufficiently different to achieve  that  goal. Moreover, Remmington's did  not  completely  match  the  'casual  and comfortable' atmosphere desired to complement the overall hotel repositioning strategy.\n\nBristol's Scoops Diner concept offered a close match to Bristol's goal of providing the customer with good overall value in a casual and comfortable atmosphere. Scoops' 1950stheme concept, however, was developed primarily for walk-in diners rather than a hotel's overnight  and  meeting  guests. Like  Remmington's, then, the  Scoops  concept  did  not exactly fit the needs of the property's new target markets.\n\nWhile  hotel  guests  were  to  be  a  prime customer  base  for  the  Intercontinental's restaurant, the property was seen to also offer great opportunity for walk-in business. (Here are some of the key site-specific characteristics  of  the  Holiday Inn Intercontinental that indicated a freestanding restaurant could generate  substantial  walk-in  business: (1)  the physical layout of the property-parking, entrance, signs, and size-was considered excellent; (2)  the  property  is  located  close  to Houston  International  Airport  on  a  major highway; and (3) there was limited restaurant competition in the area despite the potential for customers from local businesses and surrounding  hotels, some  of  which  are  limitedservice properties.) With that in mind, Bristol executives realized that the Scoops and Remmington's  concepts  did  not  have  sufficient preexisting  customer  brand  awareness  in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHouston to generate substantial walk-in traffic. In the final assessment, then, Bristol purchased the franchise rights to operate a Good Eats  Grill  in  Houston  (and  at  one  other location).\n\nA good match. Bristol management considers  Good  Eats  Grill  to  be  a  competitive concept that offers a quality product, a casual environment  that  customers  enjoy, a  respected and recognizable restaurant name in the Houston area, and proven sales volume. Another key factor mentioned by Bristol executives  was  that  the  two  organizations clicked, meaning that the corporate culture of each was well matched with the other. Both have an entrepreneurial base, both are flexible, and both have high-quality standards for a  midlevel  product  at  an  affordable  price. Shown on the next page is a table that compares  the  hotel, restaurant, and  combined marketing  strategies  of  the  two  companies (Table 6.7).\n\nKey positioning criteria. We found that a critical factor in the selection process of a hotel's  F&B  brand  or  concept  is  to  determine the customer perception that you want to create at the property and then select a restaurant  theme  that  complements  the  overall\n\nproperty's image. Bristol COO Beckert illustrated  this  by  saying, 'At  Bristol  we  try  to identify  uniqueness  in  our  F&B  concepts, which  then  become  selling  points  for  the property. The restaurant then goes on a short list that our sales staff use to sell rooms.'\n\nThe 'right' match between the hotel and the  restaurant  can  vary  from  property  to property. At  Bristol, all  39  properties  were evaluated  to  determine  which  F&B  concept best fit each property, and only two locations were selected for a Good Eats Grill franchise. As we will point out later, several key factors such as conversion costs and nearby competition must be taken into consideration prior to making the final decision.\n\nTurn up the volume. Another element related  to  positioning  is  to  determine  the  volume and customer mix expected. For example, let's review Bristol's existing company-owned restaurant brands: Scoops, Remmington's, and Bristol Bar & Grill. Bristol management will locate  a  Scoops  or  a  Remmington's  in  those properties that have above-average hotel volume, and where restaurant-customer volume comprises  primarily  walk-in  diners  who  are not using the hotel's other services. A Bristol Bar  &  Grill  concept  is  used  when  the  F&B\n\nTable 6.7 Operating Strategies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmarket is primarily hotel guests and banquet business. The  Bristol  Bar  &  Grill  is  targeted specifically  to  serve  hotel  patrons  with  a quick-serve  breakfast, convenient  lunch, and buffet-style dinner. The Good Eats Grill concept, on the other hand, generally operates as a  freestanding  restaurant, has  a  proven  sales volume ($1.5 to 2 million per year), offers consumer  value, and  has  a  comfortable  decor that's attractive to both walk-in diners and hotel guests.\n\nDuring Bristol's examination of its hotel restaurants, it  was  determined  that  a  Good Eats Grill should be used when (1) it is necessary to reposition the hotel, (2) a great restaurant-volume potential exists, (3) the physical layout and location of the property can sustain  a  freestanding  restaurant, and  (4)  the market mix comprises both hotel guests and walk-in customers.\n\nWhy Houston? Bristol's management felt that the Houston Holiday Inn Intercontinental  needed  repositioning  and  a  recognized restaurant brand like Good Eats Grill was essential for any repositioning strategy to work. Good Eats Grill  already  had  two  successful freestanding  restaurants  in  the  Houston  region. Additionally, Good  Eats  Grill  maintained an ongoing investment in local advertising. By  contrast, a  Remmington's, a Scoops, or even the Grand Cargo Cafe did not have  anywhere  near  the  same  level  of  local brand awareness and consumer acceptance.\n\nThe following list summarizes the key factors that Bristol's executives considered when selecting  Houston  as  a  location  for  a  franchised Good Eats Grill.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Those four options  are  (1)  internally  developed  restaurant  brand, (2)  franchised  restaurant  brand, (3)  straight  lease, and  (4)  management  contract. Bristol's first choice (used for 20 of its 22 restaurant outlets) is to use its own internally developed restaurant brands. Bristol believes it has a proven  track record in managing  F&B operations  profitably  ( Hotel Business, 1996).\n\nWhen Bristol introduced Good Eats Grill into two of its 22 hotels with food service, it showed a willingness to purchase a franchised brand, provided  Bristol  could  maintain  full control of restaurant operations and products (as  long  as  all  franchise  agreements  were maintained). Currently Bristol is also assessing  a  leasing  arrangement  with  yet  another restaurant company for a couple of Bristol's\n\nFairfield Inn properties. In those cases Bristol managers seem to be indicating that it would be  more  profitable  for  them  to  lease  out square footage in the hotels versus operating the F&B outlet themselves.\n\nKey franchise elements. Bristol has purchased the franchise rights for its two Good Eats  Grill  operations. The  key  elements  of the franchise agreement  are  the  menu, recipes, cooking specifications, franchise fee, restaurant  decor, music  package, training support, and  negotiated  special  provisions (e.g., use of Good Eats Grill recipes for banquets). Basically, Bristol purchased a turnkey operation from Good Eats Grill. Moreover, Good  Eats  Grill  provides  pre-  and  postopening  training  support, new  and  updated menu development, and such regional management support as consulting, auditing, and trouble-shooting.\n\nIn  exchange  for  the  franchise  and  its management  services  Good  Eats  Grill  receives  3.5  percent  of  lunch  and  dinner  revenues as a franchise fee.\n\n▶\n\n",

      "content": "W e have already mentioned how the Bristol sales office uses the company's restaurants as a  selling  point  to  assist  in  booking  rooms, meetings, and banquets. In addition there are three other marketing concerns that need to be  considered: (1)  the  competition, (2)  customer expectations, and (3) advertising.\n\nCompetition. The primary hotel competitors for Bristol's Houston Holiday Inn Intercontinental are a Marriott hotel (569 rooms), a Hyatt hotel (315 rooms), and a Sheraton hotel  (450  rooms). As  for  nearby  foodservice competition, Marriott  uses  internally  developed  restaurant  brands  (Allie's  American\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrill and CK's) along with a Pizza Hut kiosk, while the Hyatt and Sheraton offer typical hotel  restaurants. Additionally, there  are  some limited-service  hotel  properties  in  the  area that  factor  into  the  secondary  market  competitive analysis.\n\nThe  freestanding  restaurant  competition in  the  area  is  negligible. There  is  a  Kettle Restaurant  nearby, but  it  does  not  pose  a strong business threat to Good Eats Grill as it has a different target market. There is a Bennigan's and T.G.I. Friday's within three miles of the Holiday Inn, but there is no other notable  restaurant  competition  within  a  twomile radius of the hotel. As it turns out, the Holiday Inn's Good Eats Grill is popular with Marriott's, Hyatt's, and  Sheraton's  hotel guests, and  also  with  those  hotel  guests  that are staying at the surrounding limited-service properties. It  can  be  expected, then, that  a guest who stays at a hotel other than the Holiday Inn, yet eats at the Good Eats Grill, may decide  to  stay  at  the  Holiday  Inn  on  return trips to Houston.The value of the strategic alliance between the hotel and the restaurant is that  it  establishes  a  unique  identity  for  this property that  sets  it  apart  from  its  competition and provides a marketing edge.\n\nCustomer expectations. A primary missionstatement goal of both companies is to exceed customer  expectations. With  the  alliance  of the  Holiday  Inn  Intercontinental  and  Good Eats  Grill, Bristol  management  believes  the customer  is  pleasantly  surprised  with  the overall product and services that the property provides. Even though the hotel and restaurant  renovations  were  completed  just  recently, in  July  1996, the  perceived  overall value of this  property  to  the  customer  is  already  generating  new  corporate  accounts. Bristol management believes the hotel repositioning strategy in combination with the ad-\n\ndition of the Good Eats Grill is a major reason it is landing those new accounts.\n\nAdvertising. Bristol  Hotel  Company  believes  in  a  direct  sales-and-marketing  approach. The company therefore relies less on national promotion activities than many other firms. The Holiday Inn Intercontinental is no different in this regard. The hotel does some limited local advertising, but it relies primarily on a direct-sales approach along with making personal  local  contacts. Other  than  the  signs around the property, there is no joint advertising or promotion done between the hotel and the  restaurant. Good  Eats  Grill  has  four lighted signs on the property, and Bristol purchases  no  billboard  ads  for  this  property. There are two other Good Eats Grill restaurants located in Houston, and Good Eats Grill does do some radio promotion and rents billboards for those two restaurants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Other  expenses  such  as  franchise  initiation fee  ($40,000-$50,000), cost  of  renovation ($750,000), cost  of  signs  ($5,000), and  other miscellaneous  marketing  costs  (grand  opening, flyers), must also be factored into assessing the feasibility of converting or opening an\n\nTable 6.8 Profit-loss Comparison\n\n1 Outlet revenues include restaurant revenues and room service.\n\n2\n\nOther revenues include banquet-room rental, house portion of the gratuity, and\n\nmiscellaneous banquet fees.\n\nSource: Bristol Hotel Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 6.9 Key Property Performance Indicators\n\noperation prior to proceeding with a project like the one between Holiday Inn Intercontinental and Good Eats Grill.\n\nFinal analysis. Throughout this case study analysis, we  emphasized  how  important  the repositioning strategy was in turning around the Houston Holiday Inn Intercontinental. A quick look at key property performance indicators (Table 6.9) demonstrates the success of that repositioning strategy.\n\nMoreover, we focused primarily on only one part of the hotel's repositioning strategy, that is, its strategic alignment with a particular restaurant  concept. Other  factors  also  contributed  to  the  property's  improved  performance, including new  ownership  and management, an  influx  of  cash  for  renovations, and its new market position. Nevertheless, the  alliance  between  Bristol  and  Good Eats  Grill  is  seen  as  key  to  the  property's turnaround. The  property's  previous  restaurant, the Grand Cargo Cafe, was being operated as a hotel amenity rather than as a profit center. To  capitalize  on  the  restaurant's  po-\n\ntential, the  Bristol  management team recognized  that  a  new  restaurant  concept  was needed.After objectively evaluating their options, including their own F&B concepts, the team determined that a Good Eats Grill franchise  matched  Bristol's  restaurant  needs  for this  particular  property. The  Bristol  experience demonstrates the importance of evaluating  each  property  on  an  individual  basis rather  than  making  generalizations  about what will work for all hotel properties.\n\nIn conclusion, from our perspective there is no question that now and in the future we will see more hotel and restaurant companies establishing strategic alliances. It is no longer financially feasible for a hotel restaurant to be operated as just a support function to the hotel's lodging operations. The hotel restaurant must now be viewed as a selling point to generate  increased  room  and  restaurant  revenues. The hotel restaurant must be managed as  its  own  profit  center  where  the  goal  is  to maximize overall property profits. For the entire  property to be profitable, the restaurant concept and the hotel's market position must complement each other. Put another way, in today's competitive business environment the hotel  restaurant  cannot-and should not try to-be all things  to  all  people. To  achieve  a competitive edge, hotel companies must consider operating a franchised restaurant brand or leasing space within the hotel to a restaurant  company. Doing  so  may  improve  customer  perception  and  value, and  as  a  result increase the overall profitability of the property.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

In other hotels you may find a Director of Catering and Convention Service reporting to the Director of Marketing, with the Banquet positions reporting  to  Food  and  Beverage. In  the  latter arrangement, Convention  Service  usually handles  food  and  beverage  functions  for groups with 20 or more sleeping rooms with Catering selling and servicing the local social and  business  markets. Convention  Service then does not sell; the room sales department handles  that  aspect. Convention  Service  in most hotels, however, handles all of the nonfood related logistics, including room set-up,\n\naudio-visual requirements, etc. In hotels where conventions are not an important market segment, Convention Service may not exist, in  which  case  Catering  would  handle  all food and non-food logistics.\n\nThe  Director  of  Catering  assigns  and oversees all functions; oversees catering sales managers; oversees all marketing efforts; interacts with clients and catering managers; coordinates  with  the  hotel  sales  director; and works  with  the  chef  to  update  and  create menus.\n\nUnder the Director of Catering there may be an Assistant Catering Director who helps with marketing, oversees Catering Sales Managers, and  services  one  or  more  accounts. There  may  be  several  Catering  Sales  Managers, depending  on  the  size  of  the  hotel. Catering Sales Managers maintain client contacts and service accounts. Their role is to sell and  service  functions. They  must  seek  and consult with clients, plan menus, themes, room set-up and decor; negotiate prices; and coordinate  with  inside  departments  and  outside vendors. There  are  several  excellent  graphic room-setup  software  packages  available  on the market.\n\nThe Catering Department may also employ Catering Sales Representatives who are usually involved only with selling, leaving the servicing to others.\n\nThe  Banquet  Manager  implements  the Director  of  Catering's  requests; oversees room captains; supervises functions in progress; staffs and schedules servers and bartenders; and  coordinates  all  support  departments. He or she is the operations director, as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nopposed to catering executives, who primarily sell and work with clients to plan events.\n\nThe Assistant  Banquet  Manager  reports to the Banquet Manager and supervises table settings  and  decor. There  may  be  two  (or more)  assistants; for  example, a  hotel  may have one for the day and one for the evening shift.\n\nThe Banquet Set-up Manager supervises the banquet set-up crew; orders tables, chairs, portable  bars, and  other  room  equipment from storage; and supervises the tear-down of the room after the event has concluded.\n\nThe  Scheduler, often  referred  to  as  the Diary  Clerk, enters  bookings  in  the  Master Log (now usually computerized); oversees the timing of all functions and provides adequate turnover time between functions; is responsible  for  scheduling  meeting  rooms, reception areas, pool-side areas, meal functions, beverage functions, other functions, and equipment requirements; keeps  appropriate  records  to ensure against overbooking and double booking  of  space; and  is  responsible  for  communicating this information to relevant departments.\n\nThe Maître d'Hôtel is the floor manager. He or she is in charge of all service personnel and oversees all aspects of guest service during meal and beverage functions in the various function rooms on the floor.\n\nThe Captain is the room manager and is in charge of service at meal functions in a specific  room. Captains typically oversee all activity in the entire function room or, depending on the size of the room, in a portion of it. They also supervise the Servers in their room or section of the room.\n\nThere  are  two  types  of  Servers, Food Servers and Beverage Servers. Food Servers deliver  foods, alcoholic  and  non-alcoholic beverages, and utensils to the table; clear ta-\n\nbles; and  attend  to  guest  needs. Beverage Servers serve alcoholic beverages, usually at receptions. Bus  persons, whose  primary  responsibilities are to clear tables, restock side stands, and  serve  ice  water, rolls, butter  and condiments, sometimes back up servers.\n\nThe Bartender concentrates on alcoholic beverage production and service. Bartenders are  often  assisted  by  Bar  Backs, whose  primary responsibility is to initially stock and replenish the bars with liquor, ice, glassware and other necessary supplies.\n\nHousemen  (sometimes  referred  to  as porters)  set  up  function  rooms  with  risers, hardware, tables, chairs  and  other  necessary equipment. They report to the Banquet Setup Manager.\n\nAttendants 'refresh' meeting rooms during breaks by emptying ashtrays when smoking is permitted, refilling water pitchers, and removing trash. Some catered functions also require Coat-Check Attendants or Restroom Attendants.\n\nThe Clerk (or Secretary) handles routine correspondence, types contracts and banquet event orders (BEOs), handles and routes telephone  messages, and  distributes  documents to  relevant  staff  members  and  other  hotel departments.\n\nThe  Engineering  Department  provides necessary  utilities  service, such  as  air  conditioning/heating, setting  up  electrical  panels for major exhibits, hanging banners, and setting up audio visual displays.\n\nOther miscellaneous positions include the following. A Sommelier (or Wine Steward) is used  only  at fancy, upscale  events. The Cashier  sells  drink  tickets  to  guests  at  cash bars. A Ticket Taker may be required to collect  tickets  from  guests  at  the  door  to  the function. Finally, most  catering  departments employ  Stewards  to deliver the proper\n\n<!-- image -->\n\namount of china, glassware, and silver to function rooms.\n\nWhatever  the  organizational  structure, catering's  favorable  impact  on  hotel  profitability is primarily due to the fact that catering has  more  control  over  the  variable expenses than does the manager of a typical restaurant. In  a  restaurant, labor  must  be scheduled, heat/air conditioning must be on, and food must be kept in inventory, whether or not any guests are present in the facility. In catering, a  function  must  be  booked  before these  items  are  scheduled  or  purchased. So there are more variable costs in catering, and more fixed costs in restaurant foodservice.\n\n",

The list is endless.\n\nA  marketing  plan  should  be  developed that clearly defines the desirable target markets; defines  the  demand; describes  competing  caterers; sets  financial  goals; considers other potential income that catering can generate  for  the  hotel; and  describes  standardized procedures that must be used to canvass for new clients, qualify leads, make sales calls,\n\ndevelop contracts, and provide required products and services.\n\nThe  initial  contact  for  a  function  can come from the client or the catering department.

He or she may contact you  by  phone, by  letter, fax, email, or  in person.\n\nIf the contact is by phone, be sure the person  answering  the  phone  can  answer  questions, or  that  someone  knowledgeable  is always  available.

Also, keep  a  binder  handy  for browsing  that  contains  testimonial  letters from  happy  clients  and  photos  of  previous events.\n\nA Group History File should be created whenever  initial  contact  is  made. The  file should include all facets of the business relationship, from initial contact to final disposition. Standardized information includes name of contact, name of decision maker, titles, organization, types  of  events  held, number  of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nevents held, when events are held, attendance figures, all correspondence, notes from phone conversations, contracts, credit history, potential for future business, and client preferences.\n\nThe  manager  responding  to  client  inquiries must understand the hotel's capabilities. He or she especially needs knowledge of food  and  beverage  production  and  service. Planning a menu for a small group is quite different from a large group. For example, soufflé for 1,000 would be quite impossible.\n\nWhen planning a menu, the caterer must first  know  the  occasion  or  reason  for  the event.The style of service also depends on the occasion. It would be inappropriate to have a deli sandwich buffet for an auspicious awards banquet.\n\nWith international events, protocol must be considered in everything from decor to dietary restrictions. The World of Culture website  (http://www.webofculture.com/) provides good information on a variety of cultures.\n\nPublic  space  or  function  rooms  must  be forecast for space utilization, just as the hotel sales  department  forecasts  sleeping  rooms requirements.\n\nWorking well with inside departments is critical. Linens have to be requisitioned from the linen room; engineers must insure that the room temperature is appropriate; tables must be  set  up; and  purchasing  must  order  the correct  amounts  and  types  of  food  and beverages.\n\nOutside  vendors, such  as  decorators, audio-visual companies, florists, printers, and photographers may be needed by the client to ensure a successful event.\n\nPerforming well is the next step. Here the emphasis shifts from sales to service. Guests must  be  treated  with  care; service  must  be punctual; foods, presentations, cleanliness, and ambiance must meet desired quality stan-\n\ndards; professional attention must be paid to all details; the function host should be made to feel like a guest at the event, instead of a harassed  and  worried  manager. Last  minute requests and crises must be handled quickly and efficiently. It is imperative to be flexible.\n\nFollow-up  is  vital  for  repeat  business. Standardized  procedures  should  be  developed for thank-you calls and individualized, personal thank-you letters. Completed events  should  be  evaluated  with  staff  and client input. Referral business should be solicited. Appropriate  souvenir  gifts  may  be presented. And outstanding accounts should be settled.\n\n",

      "content": "I ssues facing the catering department in the future  include  new  alcohol  restrictions; the demand for more menu alternatives, including low-fat, pesticide-free, generally safe, uncontaminated products; the competition from off-premise catering firms; waste disposal regulations  and  recycling; consumers  becoming more value conscious; and service becoming a more important point of differentiation.\n\nSubcontracting  will  become  more  common, especially  for  labor  and  food. Calling one company to provide servers is more efficient  than  having  staff  on  the  phone  calling individual  on-call  workers. The  independent labor  contractor  trains  staff  and  does  all  of the payroll and paperwork.\n\nCaterers can't afford to have all types of expertise  on  their  staffs. With  a  Japanese theme, a  sushi  restaurant  may  be  subcontracted. Or a local barbecue specialist, oyster roaster, or coffee service company can handle unique events. The hotel would add about 20 percent  markup  to  the  subcontractor's  bill,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand then add the cost of the rest of the meal prepared in-house.\n\nIn the past, menus rarely changed. Today, many menus are changed with the season. In the  future  it  will  be  important  to  be  able to  distinguish  between  a  fad  and  a  trend. Fads, such  as  Nouvelle  Cuisine, are  shortlived. Trends, such  as  the  demand  for  fresh foods  and  more  nutritious  food, are  more permanent.\n\nProbably the biggest challenge is the perception among guests that all caterers are exactly  alike. Buyers  may  feel  that  there  is always another caterer able to provide similar service. It is imperative  for  the  successful caterer to differentiate their food and service from their competition. The price/value rela-\n\ntionship  will  become  more  important  as  caterers attempt to rise above the competition.\n\nThere are a multitude of resources available  on  the  web, including, for  example, Room Calculator  (http://www.mmaweb.com/ meetings/Workshop/roomcalc.html), which will  determine  how  many  guests  you  can  fit into  a  room  in  various  configurations. Many caterers have their menus online which are interesting  to  see. Special  Events  Magazine (http://www.specialevents.com/magazine/) and  Event  Solutions  (http://www.event-solutions.com/)  have  timely  articles  that  are archived online and are searchable.\n\nA large collection of useful catering web links  can  be  found  at: http://www.unlv.edu/ Tourism/Catering_and_Special_Events.html.\n\n",

By this time I have been at work for an hour or more and start taking victories as soon as they come. The day is half over for the dedicated line cast members who started working at 4:00 A.M. so our thousands of guests can enjoy their morning breakfast. These employees\n\nare the backbone of catering.

Without customers, the  grandest  ballrooms, the  most spectacular  cuisine, and  the  best  service  are all moot points. So, every day you must work to fill the pipeline with customers. The rooms sales  managers  are  really  doing  a  great  job. They are booking over quota and getting contracts  with  great  food  and  beverage  minimums. For just a moment, I fantasize that this will never end and life will always be good.\n\nOh no! We have just been asked why the week between Christmas and New Year's does not have any events. Transient room sales are strong, but they do not use function space. It's up to catering sales to fill in the hole. My team tells  me  that  had  sales  not  already  done  so they could easily fill space a week before or a week later, but that holiday week is going to be tough to fill. I know this is true, but the senior  vice  president  does  not  care  that  something is tough. He wants to know what we are doing to get business. And by the way, not discount business. We start out looking for fullpaying customers and if that does not work, then we will look at discounting.\n\nI am excited to meet a customer for a site visit at 7:30 A.M. I am the first property she is looking  at  for  a  2,500-guest  reception  and concert. I just talked to her yesterday for the very  first  time. All  our  meeting  space  is booked but I'm in luck; we have space in our arena. I  work  with  the  arena  for  about  an hour  to  get  the  space  and  brainstorm  on things  we  can  do  to  book  this  business. The arena operations guys are great to work with. They enjoy coming to the catering office for cappuccino. I smile when I think how cheap cappuccino  is  and  how  many  favors  it  buys from operations cast members.\n\nWe spend an hour walking our customer through  her  event. Her  company  sells  very\n\nlarge industrial trucks, and when we tell her we can put a concrete mixer right in the middle of her reception she is all smiles. I make note  to  get  the  dimensions  of  the  roll-up doors. We  are  going  to  be  more  expensive than  the  competition, but  we  provide  more value. We can make this a one-stop shopping experience. I make a note to call transportation companies and gather quotes. I know the other properties will not get involved in dealing with all the outside vendors, and I use this as  a  selling  advantage. I  make  a  note  to  list this  as  a  tentative  piece  of  business  worth $165,000 or more.\n\nNext I make a hasty trip across property to check on a breakfast we are doing on the stage of our production show.We are lucky to have  an  incentive  house  tour  our  property, and we have pulled out all the stops to let this VIP group know we value their business. I am pleased  with  the  spectacular  stage  sets  and the  look  of  the  breakfast. I  laugh  with  the sales  manager  when  he  apologizes  for  only giving us 36 hours notice on the breakfast. I assure  him  the  financial  rewards  of  getting large incentive bookings will more than make up for the short notice. I make a note to send each  guest  a  thank-you  note  for  taking  the time to tour our property.\n\n",

Repeat  customers  are  usually  the best ones to have, but they tend to remember that  five  years  ago  the  potato  salad  did  not have a spoon in it when the company president went to the buffet 15 minutes before it\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwas scheduled to open.'Let's not let that happen this year.'\n\nYou spend months working to get everything planned at least three weeks in advance. Then you give all the information to the operating departments two weeks out. For some groups  this  works  really  well, and  once  you work  out  the  details  they  only  make  minor changes. Other groups are not quite so tidy in their planning.\n\nToday I had a group arrive on site, and we reviewed their banquet event orders. It would be easier to say we redid their banquet event orders  (BEOs). At  9:00  A.M. we  started  reviewing 45 meal function BEOs. By 2:15 P.M. we had made major changes to 42 of them. I wonder aloud if they would like to change the other three just for good measure. The chefs are circling the catering office like sharks. All the food ordering is on hold until the revised BEOs are signed off on. While I'm working with  the  clients  to  refinalize, the  chefs  and purchasing agents are on the phone undoing all the ordering they did days ago. Purveyors are all on standby to rush product to us. I am thankful we have excellent relationships with these wonderful people, who will now pull off miracles to get us product over the weekend.\n\nMy assistant is ready to shoot someone. Making  the  changes  once  is  enough  of  a challenge, but  now  we  are  changing  things for  a  second  and  third  time  in  one  day. I smile as I say, 'Yes, I'm sure I can get you a completely  new  set  of  BEOs  by  5:00  P.M.' Just  as  I  tell  myself  we  must  be  done  with changes, my contact calls and changes two of the remaining original three BEOs. I get no comfort from the fact that the one lone original BEO is for an event that does not happen until five days from now. I do, however, get  great  comfort  from  the  knowledge  that my  clients  will  spend  over  $800,000  in  the next eight days.\n\n▶\n\n",

      "content": "A beverage such as a glass of wine, a beer, or a  cocktail  has  the  magic  power  of  bringing\n\npeople together. Beverages have always made an  impact  on  the  evolution  of  humankind. Thanks to modern technology and more advanced  carbon-dating  techniques, archeologists have  now  established  with  certainty that our species has been around for several\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhundred  thousand  years-a  lot  longer  than was estimated 50 years ago. In accepting the fact that alcohol is as old as we are, it would be  of  great  interest  to  discover  what  type  of beverages were consumed over such a span of time.We can only assume that the earliest beverages were fermented cider-type concoctions made  from  various  kinds  of  fruit, or  brews made from grain, seeds, and anything else nature  had  to  offer. These  drinks  were  perhaps enriched with spices, herbs, and probably more exotic  flavoring  agents, some  of  which  have been forgotten or lost over the centuries.\n\nWhat is known for certain is included in recorded  history, and  it  is  relatively  recent when compared to the newly found lifespan of Homo  sapiens  erectus. In  recent  excavations, some of the first evidence of eating food and  consuming  a  beverage  in  a  communal fashion is found in the Orkney Islands, close to  Denmark. It  was  a  custom  then  to  build dwellings around a common dispenser where foods and drinks were prepared.\n\nEgyptologists  have  recently  published photos  of  wall  paintings  found  in  pharaohs' tombs. In these remarkably preserved works of  art  one  can  clearly  see  Egyptian  workers harvesting  grapes  and  preparing  them  for winemaking. The  (presumably  filled)  wine vessels were then placed in an orderly fashion next  to  the  tomb. The  Egyptian  nobles  believed  that  these  beverages  made  the  best companions for the pharaoh's eternal travel.\n\nGreek and Roman historians report that wine and other alcoholic beverages played a vital role in their societies. The fun-loving Romans went as far as worshiping a beverage deity: Bacchus, the god of wine. Wine and brew shops, which are thought to have been introduced  approximately  6,000  years  ago, could be  found  at  every  street  corner  of  ancient Rome. In the United States, the first person\n\non record to own a tavern and sell alcoholic beverages  to  patrons  was  Samuel  Cole. His beverage business was already prospering by 1634.\n\nBeer, which presently accounts for 51 percent of alcoholic beverage sales, carries on a fine tradition in our country. According to the diary of the Mayflower 's captain, the ship was not scheduled to dock on Plymouth Rock but was made to stop there mainly because it had run out of beer.\n\nNonalcoholic  beverages  such  as  coffee, tea, fruit juices, and, later, carbonated beverages have also made a considerable impact on our  evolution  and  lifestyle. During  the  past five decades, Coca-Cola has taken the world by storm. Of the hot beverages, coffee and tea are  the  uncontested  kings. One  has  to  only observe  the  proliferation  of  specialty  coffee shops and kiosks to begin to understand the impact of this beverage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "T he  beverage  industry  grows  in  popularity every year. Restaurant U.S.A., the official publication  of  the  National  Restaurant Association, reported in 1995 that total sales for bars and taverns neared the $11 billion mark. For the year 2005, total sales for bars and taverns are expected to exceed the threshold of $15 billion in sales. Hotels, restaurants, and resorts have for some time regarded the beverage sector as a profitable one. In a medium to largesize hotel, a typical beverage department can produce a profit of over 50 percent of sales. In comparison, a food department shows, at best, a profit of between 15 and 18 percent of sales. Beverage  is  also  gradually  gaining  a  larger share  of  sales. Hotel  operators  report  that while  two  decades  ago  the  sales  ratio  was\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n85-15 (85 percent food sales, 15 percent beverage  sales), today  the  average  is  closer  to 80-20.\n\nBefore  World  War  II, in a small  to medium-sized hotel and restaurant operation, the person in charge of the beverage department  was  the  restaurant  manager. In  many properties, a lead bartender or the wine steward  was  given  the  responsibility  to  run  the department.\n\nToday, in a medium to large-size hotel operation, the  beverage  department  has  a  distinct place in the organization chart, and the beverage manager is the person in charge of\n\nrunning and supervising all of the department activities. The organization chart is a diagram that shows the operation's working positions and  how  they  interconnect. The  beverage manager usually reports to the food and beverage director. In a very large hotel operation (over 2,000), the F&B director reports to the vice president of food and beverage.\n\nDuring  the  last  decade, some  properties have adopted a different strategy where there are separate food and beverage directors. In these  properties  the  executive  chef, who  in most cases acts more as a food director than a hands-on chef, is placed in charge of the food\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndepartment. He or she enjoys a higher degree of  independence  and  reports  directly  to  the general manager, vice president of operations, or, in  some  instances, directly  to  the  hotel president. The  same  is  true  of  the  beverage director.\n\nBoth  of  these  directors  are  considered equal in the organization chart. They strive to work  together  effectively  and  to  communicate  daily. They  are  interdependent  in  many ways but also aware of the need for communication. In  addition, each  must  establish  a sound  working  rapport  with  department heads  of  other  hotel  sectors. These  include front desk supervisors, executive housekeepers, human  resource  directors, and  so  forth. Typical of this case, the food manager and the beverage  manager, particularly, come  together at the end of the month, when the results of their efforts are included in the same profit and loss statement.\n\nAlthough  larger  properties  find  this  organization  chart  modification  beneficial  to the operation, the majority of hotel properties retain  the  traditional  hierarchy, structuring the chain of command in the same fashion as for the past six or seven decades.A typical example  of  a  classic  organization  chart  for  a beverage operation in a large hotel is shown in Figure 6.3.\n\n",

      "content": "T he bar manager or beverage director is the person who makes it all happen in relation to hotel  beverages. Although  specific  responsibilities  may  vary  from  one hotel to another, the  fundamental  role  of  the  manager  is  to make certain that the five basic functions of\n\nmanagement  are  applied  effectively. As  in many other business sectors, these are planning, organizing, directing, staffing, and  controlling. The wise and competent bar manager applies and adapts the fundamental principles of  each  of  these  functions  to  the  specific needs of the operation. All five functions are determining  factors  in  meeting  the  operation's ultimate objective: profitability.\n\nIt all begins with planning and continues in  directing  and  organizing  so  that  the  staff on a daily basis diligently adheres to the established standards. Examples: checking bartenders' opening and closing duties, standardizing drink recipes, verifying that the bar par  stock  (established  amount  of  beverage product)  is  at  the  proper  level, scheduling, forecasting, frequently  communicating  with other  fellow  managers  (in  particular  the catering manager and the executive steward), and so forth.\n\nThe competent bar manager always finds sufficient  time  to  inspect  the  underbars  (the working area behind and underneath the bar counter), the  jockey  boxes  (the  small  compartment next to the ice bin), and the speed racks (where the inexpensive, or well, bottles and the more popular brand-name liquor are placed).\n\nThe above are also the areas where managers cannot place enough emphasis on how vital it is to the operation to continuously apply sanitary standards and practice the utmost cleanliness. Glassware  must  not  only  be cleaned but sanitized as well.\n\nAn important organizational and training function is the sequencing of beverage stock. This is the order in which spirits and cordials are  placed  on  the  shelves  or  speed  rack. It also  refers  to  the  order  by  which  the  drinks are  called  to  the  bartender  by  the  serving staff, and it must always be the same. Super-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvising  the  beverage  staff  and  ensuring  that control methods are foolproof are crucial and demanding tasks; sequencing provides part of the  structural  mix  that  helps  assure  consistency of product and service.\n\n",

The marketing of the overall operation and the merchandising of the beverage product  require  time, experience, and  commitment. To make  the  beverage  operation attractive to different types of patrons and to convey a message of value in the service  of beverages, bar managers and directors regularly  brainstorm. More  trendy  cocktails  are being  created  daily. Light  and  refreshing blush  wines  and  sparkling  wines  are  introduced  in  the  preparation  of  new  drinks. Promotional  programs  and  attractive  entertainment  are  featured  to  keep  lounges  full and patrons eager to return.\n\nConscientious  beverage  managers  never rest on their laurels-they are always on the lookout for profitable ways to stay ahead of the  competition.

According to Kotschevar and Luciani (1996), 'with the new millennium passing by, customers' expectations are on the rise.'An effective leader finds the proper ways and means to provide the employees with the tools they need to meet these expectations.\n\nProgressive beverage managers now also use  the  empowerment  concept. Empowerment is a management decision by which an employee is given authority to take steps outside the spectrum of regular duties and make certain  decisions  that  are  normally  in  management's  domain. According  to  many  new beverage managers, the progressive coach approach seems to yield positive results among beverage  staffs.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I n medium to larger hotel properties, like all department managers,beverage managers are required to prepare a business forecast based on historical data, hotel occupancy, and spe-\n\ncial event bookings for the forecasting period. An accurate forecast helps the manager prepare  for  clientele  volume  so  that  potential revenue  can  be  maximized. It also  helps greatly  in  effectively  managing  beverage stock, payroll, staff scheduling, and  other expenses.\n\nMany hotel executives agree that the first decade of the twenty-first century will be significant for the beverage industry. One peculiar  prediction  is  that, although  total  hotel revenues  are  expected  to  grow  considerably, the ratio of beverage sales to room sales will remain the same or decrease slightly. Because of the terrorist attacks in 2001 and the ongoing wars in the Middle East, hotel revenues have not met expectations. Beverage sales, though, have  seen  an  increase  in  revenue  growth. Much of this is due to vigorous promotion and merchandising, particularly  of  new  cocktails and ambitious-even spectacular-wine sales programs. Independent bar and lounge operators also feel confident that, unless more unpredictable events take place, the rest of the decade will be challenging but prosperous.\n\nBeverage distributing firms are also optimistic. They  foresee  a  wider  availability  of beverage products not only for the hospitality industry but also in areas such as convenience stores, supermarkets, and  beverage-specific retail outlets. Beverages that are expected to substantially increase in sales volume are bottled waters, bottled specialty teas, single-malt Scotch whiskys, Cognacs, aged bourbons, premium tequilas, and grappas.There is a general consensus among vendors that beer sales will remain static and that wine will experience a marginal but steady growth, particularly from new areas of production, both nationally and internationally.\n\nIt is expected that federal and state liquor laws  will  remain  substantially  unchanged,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith minor exceptions. It also appears that the states will maintain the basic structure of belonging either to control or license categories. Many  beverage  managers  are  concerned about  government-imposed  taxes  on  liquor and hope they will not be increased.\n\nBeverage managers are concerned about the continuing lowering of the blood alcohol threshold  for  driving  under  the  influence (DUI)  of  alcohol  or  drugs. The  lower  the threshold-say, 0.08-the more careful in hiring, training, and supervising managers have to be. Over-service of alcohol is an industrywide problem that presents managers with a variety of challenges. It is important to have policies under which the manager and operation work that minimize the risk to the business and to the public while legally selling and serving beverages.\n\nEducation in beverage management is expected  to  extend  to  new  horizons. Sonoma State University offers a bachelor of science degree in wine management. Through a wellplanned  university  extension  program, the University of California, Davis, is expanding on  specialized  short  courses  associated  with their degree programs in enology and viticulture. The William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration at the University of Nevada, Las  Vegas, started  a  beverage  management major  commencing  in  the  fall  semester  of 2001. Cornell  University's  School  of  Hotel Administration, among others, is considering expanding  their  professional  development courses and adding courses on handling and serving alcoholic beverages with care.\n\n",

      "content": "W hile reviewing the industry's projections, it would  be  difficult  to  leave  out  hotel  execu-\n\ntives'  most  recent  comments on labor issues and concerns. During the past decade, it has been frequently reported that staffing or finding the person most suitable for a particular job is becoming a tougher management function. Many  managers  agree  that  staffing  responsibilities  are  requiring  more  time  and effort than ever before. Part of this is attributed to labor trends. The pool of steady and loyal  workers  is  decreasing  in  size. In  addition, the  hospitality  industry  is  experiencing unprecedented  employee  turnover. A  major restaurant company has recently reported to me employee turnover of nearly 200 percent for hourly employees, 60 percent for clerical and secretarial staff, and 25 percent for managerial staff. The turnover ratio of bartenders and  cocktail  servers  was  reported  to  be  almost the same as that of typical dining room staff  such  as  food  servers  and  bus  persons (Lattin, 1998). One  can  imagine  the  frustration of a beverage manager who, after spending  considerable  effort, time, and  company money  in  coaching  and  training  a  new  bartender, finds  out  she  is  planning  to  quit  the following week.\n\nWhat can be done to deal effectively with this concern? Rewards as motivators provide some positive results. Other means of providing  monetary  incentives  so  the  operation can  retain  employees  longer  may  also  be effective.\n\nIt  is  strongly recommended here that the best measure management can undertake for this purpose is to provide the employee with a comfortable  working  environment, promote teamwork and camaraderie, and foster healthy working  relationships. In  short, the  beverage manager  is  challenged  to  become  the  employer of choice for beverage professionals.\n\nIn  general, the  beverage  future  looks brighter  than  most  other  sectors  of  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhospitality  industry. However, the  managers and directors who truly will make a difference will  be  those  who  step  out, participate, and make  things  happen. The  aggressive  new manager always finds ways to establish a good rapport  with  community  leaders  and  is  tireless in devising and developing new means of attracting additional clientele. Whenever possible, he or she makes the effort to attend beverage conventions and trade shows; uses the hotel  website  to  reinforce  marketing  strate-\n\ngies  and  list  bar  special  drinks, promotions, and happy hour times; and never rests on his or her laurels.\n\nThe  modern  beverage  manager  is  no longer  just  the  head  bartender. This  professional is responsible for millions of dollars of the  hotel's  assets  and  operates  in  a  highenergy, fast-paced, and  challenging  environment. It's a lot of fun, though, and rewarding, too. It  is  a  managerial  position  with  a  solid future.\n\n",

The  food  court  is  located  in  a common area  not  far  from  some  of  the  resort's most popular, kid friendly recreational activities. It also attracts local guests who are not staying at the resort, but just visiting.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon, when the hotel's 2,500 rooms and suites were nearly at full occupancy, an incident occurred at the branded sandwich  shop  that  was  both  bizarre  and frightening to those involved.\n\nAs was typical of the property, lunchtime in the common restaurant area was busy and extended well into the afternoon as families arrived for weeklong stays.

      "content": "For most hotel companies, it was only during the  1980s  that  the  word marketing was anything  more  than  a  euphemism  for  sales. Indeed, in the competitive landscape of the not too  distant  past, an  aggressive  and  knowledgeable  sales  staff  could  accomplish  most activities  that  related  to  putting  guests  in rooms. In the competitive environment of the present  time, this has  become  impossible. Hotel  companies  that  design  and  market  a sophisticated inventory of hospitality services need  a  similarly  sophisticated  scheme  for letting  potential  clientele  know  about  their services.\n\nFor most hotel companies in the twentyfirst  century, true  marketing  has  evolved  to reflect  this  sophistication. This  development also  acknowledges  increased  sophistication on the part of guests and potential clientele. Business travelers, travel agents, and meeting\n\nplanners who represent and book group and convention  business  are  educated  and  informed consumers. To serve this clientele, hotels  have  had  to  develop  marketing  efforts and product segmentation, first to interest the market, and  second  to  allow  people  representing that market  to  make  intelligent choices among competitors. Increasingly, individual  consumers  and  small  businesses  are becoming  more  sophisticated  in  arranging their own travel plans over the Internet. This represents  yet  another  challenge  to  hotel marketers: How  do  we  market  most  efficiently to all groups? Good question.\n\nMarketing has become an umbrella term that covers a number of strategic and tactical activities  designed  to  tell  the  clientele  the story of the hotel's services and to encourage that clientele to make choices based on how one hotel's marketing message matches their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nneeds  better  than  the  available  alternatives. In any given hotel or hotel company, marketing includes a range of sales activities, public relations, advertising  in  all  media, design  of symbols  and  images, and  (increasingly)  the departments of convention services, reservations, revenue  management, and, perhaps, catering.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  research  plays  a major role in designing marketing strategies and tactics. The monograph presented in this edition by Bianca Grohmann and Eric Spangenberg has a research orientation at its core. It is designed to assist managers in choosing and generating data that are useful to staying successfully  competitive. It  is  important  that managers understand the range within which this  data  may  be  interpreted  and  applied. Successful managers and high-quality organizations  are  always  seeking  information  and data that allow them to make accurate decisions  and  design  effective  marketing  and managerial efforts.\n\nThese  data  can  take  a  number  of  forms but, for  the  most  part, deal  with  the  characteristics of the hotel's target market segment that affect their choice of hotels. In this case, the  research  seeks  to  understand  how  consumers make choices among hotels based on the value of their various attributes.\n\nAmong other data that hotels find mechanisms to accumulate and interpret are these kinds:\n\nseeks  in  terms  of  quality, service, economy; user status (nonuser, ex-user, potential user, regular  user, first-time  user); usage rate (light, medium, heavy); loyalty (none, medium, strong, absolute)\n\nWhile many of the specific details or programs implied under the marketing umbrella may be farmed out to agencies that specialize in advertising or public relations, the genesis of  the  hotel's  strategic  marketing  plan  must be within the hotel organization itself.\n\nThe article contributed to this section by Fletch Waller provides a strong argument for broadening the definition of marketing to include all operational aspects of the hotel. This article is an excellent overview of the marketing process. Waller illustrates the relationship between marketing and operations as a 'continuing process' without which hotels probably cannot remain competitive.\n\nYield management, long a practice of the airline industry, has found total acceptance by hotel marketing and reservations systems. Indeed, it has become an industry standard.The article in this section by Paul Chappelle can be read in conjunction with that by Quain and LeBruto  in  Section  4  for  a  comprehensive primer on yield management. Together, these articles explore various aspects of that practice from the viewpoint of Chappelle, current practitioner. Chappelle  lives  the  theory  of yield and revenue management on a daily basis and provides insights about how it works in practice. As the revenue manager for over 30  hotels, Chappelle  has  the  experience  to back up the theory.\n\nNew for this edition, the Sinclair essay on hotel pricing should be read in the context of the issues and suggestions raised by the contributions on yield management. But it goes beyond that. Drawing on Sinclair's deep experience  in  hotel  operations, particularly sales, this contemporary work on pricing is up\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto date and useful not only from a conceptual standpoint but a practical one.\n\nShaw and Morris bring their collaborative talents in academe and industry to the essay on  the  organization  of  the  sales  function  in hotels. Because, as  noted  elsewhere  in  this text many times, the potential markets for a hotel's services and the types of hotel are so numerous, sales  efforts  can  be  complicated. Shaw  and  Morris  present  this  complex  departmental  function  in  a  clear, straightforward fashion that is both theoretically relevant and operationally practical.\n\nTraditionally, the function of public relations for any organization, particularly hotels, was oriented toward the generation of favorable-usually  free-publicity  and  the  suppression or management of bad news. Louis Richmond  proposes  the  different  and  expanded but not necessarily contrary position that  public  relations  activities  can  positively enhance  the  hotel's  sales  and  marketing  efforts. He discusses his experiences in the case of the Seattle Sheraton Hotel and Towers. Using that example, he argues that through creative  cooperative  efforts  with  local  charity,\n\ncultural, and  volunteer  organizations, hotels can serve the activities of those groups' fundraising  efforts  and  simultaneously  position themselves to show the arbiters of potential business how well the hotel can perform. His examples  are  instructive. Richmond, who  is president of his own very successful public relations  firm  in  Seattle, retains  the  Sheraton and other hospitality concerns as clients.\n\nAll in all, the strategies, tactics, activities, personnel, and concepts described in articles and essays in this section provide an overview that only hints at everything important to effective  management  of  the  marketing  function. Marketing is perhaps the most written-about  topic  in  hospitality  literature. Because of  the  great  diversity  of  opinion, it can be argued that there is no one 'right' way to market, nor is any single piece of literature generally considered seminal to hotel marketing. The reader is urged to consider the references  cited  by  contributing  authors, the suggested readings, and active perusal of recent  hospitality  journals  to  achieve  greater understanding  of  this  fascinating  processand, by extension, its management.\n\n",

      "content": "Fletch Waller\n\nThe hotel  business  has  changed  enormously over the last 30 years, embracing special niche forms  of  lodging  (e.g., extended  stay), new ways of segmenting markets (e.g., W's 'fashionables'), brand proliferation and consolidation, new tools for acquiring customers (e.g., email), distribution  innovations  (e.g., Expedia), and globalization. These changes in mar-\n\nkets and in ways hotels relate to and capitalize on them have put new demands on marketing.\n\nMarketing, as addressed herein is not the sales and marketing department; I mean marketing in its broadest sense of how hotels respond to and seize on market opportunities. Definition? Marketing is a process of creating\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  sustaining  productive  relationships  with desirable  customers. Its goal?  To  produce such relationships more effectively than competitors do.\n\nLet's examine the definition and its implications. Marketing is . . .\n\nI n the late 1990s, rising costs of acquiring customers  in  U.S. hotels  were  masked  by strong  increases  in  the  average  daily  rate (ADR). In 1995, marketing costs  per  occupied  room  (franchise  and  marketing  fees, commissions, reservation costs, and property marketing and sales expenses) in full-service hotels  averaged  15.3  percent  of  ADR. By 2000, it had risen to 15.6 percent; that threetenths  of  a  point  increase  over  four  years hardly alarmed people. But consider, of the expenses that make up the costs of acquiring customers, only  commissions  vary  directly with rate; most of the expenses are personnel compensation and benefits and purchasesof ads, brochures, sales calls, websites, global distribution system (GDS) delivery services, telephone  time, and  so  on. These  expenses grow over time, but not as a function of the\n\nprice for which a room is sold. If marketing were truly productive, we should have been seeing costs per unit dropping.\n\nIn  dollar  terms, full-service  hotels  saw marketing costs per occupied room balloon 38 percent in just five years, to $17.96 in 2000 from  $12.99  per  room-night  in  1995!  In higher-rated  full-service  hotels, acquisition costs rose to $22.71 from $15.86, a 43 percent increase. Resorts  suffered  a  27  percent  increase, to $22.96 from $18.07 just five years earlier. By  2002, as  rates  and  occupancies softened, marketing  costs  per  occupied room in full-service hotels had begun to be reined in, at $17.02, but now accounted for 16.4 percent of ADR (PKF's Trend Reports, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2003.) The main culprit is distribution costs. Whatever the cause, marketing productivity must be improved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnd the goal?\n\nBy the end of this chapter, it will be clear that successful marketing of a hotel requires the orchestration of a wide variety of talents and skills, of which sales and marketing personnel are only a part. Chain hotels approach the process one way; independents must do so another. But in either case, market success depends on an effective integration of marketing and operations at the property level under the  direction  and  leadership  of  a  marketdriven general manager.\n\n",

Investors  in  a  hotel  may have return on investment as their purpose, but  for  us  operators, it  is  useful  to  conceive our purpose as being to create and keep customers. If we do this successfully, profits and capital returns flow. Our marketing process is our way of creating and keeping customers.\n\nEvery business has a marketing process, a way it 'goes  to  market.' It  is  the  way  management  decides  what  they  are  going  to  do and offer, with whom they will compete, how they will attract the customers, and how they will  satisfy  and  keep  them. Most  businesses, many hotels  among  them, do  not  reflect  on and carefully articulate their marketing process; they just do their thing by habit and by  tradition. Other  businesses  make  concerted  efforts  to  regularly  plan  and  review their 'going to market.'\n\nA hotel is a 24/7 business, running without stop. Typically, because of the pressure just to keep up, we do what we've done in the past, repeating  our  marketing  process  by  habit. This  is  risky, for  customers  and  competitors are  always  changing. Does  a  hotel  need  a planned and regular review of its marketing process? Considering our high fixed costs and the  large  leverage  on  profits  from  small changes in revenues, yes-hotels should take concerted and disciplined care of their marketing process. For a hotel to remain effective, it should  formally review  its marketing process at least once a year to be sure it is still suited to its market; if it is not, revise it to fit changing  customer  and  competitor  patterns. Further, the  hotel  must  measure  the  cost  of acquiring  its  customers  so  as  to  steadily\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

These first two steps establish the hotel's value proposition.\n\nNext, create  awareness  and  stimulate  demand among the  people  you  hope  to  make your customers. Then you must make the hotel available to them, and close the sale-that is, commit, confirm, and  manage  revenue.

Even  so, the  management  team must still consciously examine what they intend the hotel to be and offer to whom.

Perhaps  the  business  center  has  shifted  to  another part of the city. Perhaps new customers from Korea or California  have  replaced  the original  ones  from  Europe  and  the  East Coast. Even though the owner has provided a basic envelope within which to operate, there still are options-many things the hotel team can control, many choices to be made on what to offer and to emphasize to various market segments. Is the hotel the place to be seen or the place that guards privacy? Is it better to stress family style or crisp, professional business style? Should the hotel add services, like a  Japanese  breakfast, to  meet  the  needs  of one particular group?

Pricing is a critical decision because it determines, first, whether or not the intended customers will purchase, and second, whether they  will  be  satisfied  with  the  value  offered and, thus, be willing to return. Third, it determines  whether  the  hotel  will  be  financially healthy enough to maintain itself and reward its employees so customers can once again be satisfied when they do return.\n\nThree factors must come into consideration in pricing-the Three Cs of pricing, if you will: costs, competition, and customers' comfort  zones. In  F&B, costs  drive  pricing  of menu  items  and  beverages. Drucker  (1999, 115-6) says American industry has too much cost-driven  pricing, and  that  it  needs  more price-driven costing. Doesn't F&B have the opportunity  to  build  and  test  menus  to  discover where price points should be set, and is not the chef challenged to manage ingredients and portion size to deliver the cost and margin structure desired?

Moreover, hotel  accounting  does  not measure discounts from a standard price, as do almost all other industries. So there is no visible  cost  in  reducing  price  to  meet  competitors.

The  truly  controlling factor is customer comfort zones, and all too often hotel management leave money on  the  table  because  they  don't  know  what those comfort zones are. At what price does the offer attract and deliver value? That is the key question in setting prices.\n\nPrice  setting  requires  talent  and  skill  in data  gathering  and  analysis, accounting  and building pro formas, interpreting and drawing inferences, and  decision  making. Do  not  let salespeople  set  prices; do  not  let  controllers set  prices.

Also, build at least three price scenarios and have the controller and  marketing  director  agree  on  occupancy impacts. Then run a GOP pro forma on each. Out of that exercise will come a sense of the best pricing approach to take. Setting prices is the one task the GM cannot delegate, for he or she must live with and be accountable for all that results from this critical decision.\n\n",

In decor, uniforms (costumes?), tone, and  attitude, they  focus and send a coherent message. It is critical that every  department  understands  the  target markets and agrees on the idea, the meaning the hotel intends to have for each of the target  customer  groups.

Make sure  your  salespeople  are  taught  how  to  research their prospect, to listen for needs and purposes, to  acknowledge  that  they  have heard the prospect, to transform relevant features into benefits and to sell the customer's success, to anticipate objections and prepare responses, to negotiate, to ask for the order, and  to  thank  the  customer  and  facilitate delivery.\n\nSales management is quite another thing; often (usually?) the top salesperson does not make the best sales manager. The sales manager must be able to select salespeople; reinforce their training; coach, counsel and motivate them; assign them to prospects and market segments; set goals, manage compensation, review performance; and troubleshoot. He  or  she  must  also  be  the  gatekeeper  on contracts  and  rates, making  sure  that  inventory of group space is optimally committed.\n\nannual room block and set goals for weekly contract  production  as  well. This  will  balance the sense of importance among salespeople, whether  assigned  to  large  or  small group segments.\n\nCompensation of salespeople need not be complicated. First principle: Tie compensation to goals set in terms of what you want them to do-that  is, produce  contracts  and  roomnights. Don't  just  set  room-night  goals; add measures of relationship or share of a specific customer's  business. Have  salespeople  suggest  their  own  goals  for  the  coming  year; participation  builds  commitment. Second: Provide  them  near-term  reward  and  reinforcement, not  postponed  rewards. Pay  out bonuses quarterly. Third: Build teamwork so that one salesperson supports and encourages another. Add a team bonus multiplier to personal  performance  measures. Last: Separate performance  bonuses  from  overall  job  appraisal. No one attends to suggestions for performance improvement if he or she has just received a big check for exceeding goal.\n\nMany full-service hotels are overresourced in group sales and under-weighted\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin transient market tools. Sales efforts should be balanced with other parts of the marketing mix-advertising, publicity, and promotions.\n\nThe range of communication options increases  geometrically  with  proliferation  of new media-cable television, news magazines and national papers, the Internet, and direct mail and telemarketing. But the eyeballs are not growing apace, meaning the audience for any one medium is steadily shrinking, putting increasing demand on measures of productivity, care in allocating resources, and creativity to  get  through  the  clutter. As  audiences  of prospects  become  increasingly  expensive  to reach through advertising, the tools of publicity, the Internet, and direct marketing are increasingly the media of choice.\n\nThe Internet is a demanding medium for communication; use professional help to design, maintain, and market the hotel's website as though it were, itself, a product for which awareness must be created and demand stimulated. To draw audience to the site and manage  its  visibility  in  search  engines  are  skills beyond the property team. Set specific goals for the site: They might be to attract qualified prospects, to sell services, to provide customer\n\nservice. Don't just have a site. And measure the experts against those goals. A passive, unmanaged, and undermarketed site is a waste of money.\n\nPromotions can powerfully stimulate demand, but too often, price promotions are resorted to as a last-minute attempt to prop up a weak demand period. Promotions should be planned, justified  on  a  breakeven  basis, and used  sparingly. Not  all  promotions  need  be price  promotions; customers  invest  energy and  time  in  transactions, too: value-added promotions  that  offer  nonmonetary  savings can be used to avoid habituating consumers to  buying  only  on  sale  or  shopping  only  on price. Well-forged  alliances  for  copromotion can  increase  both  productivity  and  absolute sales volume.\n\nThe skills and talents necessary in a comprehensive  effort  to  create  awareness  and stimulate demand include:\n\n",

      "content": "O nce a person in one of your target markets is  interested  in  buying, how  does  he  or  she reach  you?  Your  hotel's  reservations  office, the central reservation system, airline global distribution  systems, corporate  sales  offices, and your property sales office are all parts of a  distribution  network. Travel  agents, corporate travel managers and secretaries, meeting planners, and travelers themselves reach your hotel through this network.\n\nTravel industry distribution channels are in chaos by virtue of the shift of travel agencies from commission to fee-for-service models, the  rise  of  the  Internet  as  a  consumer's direct  booking  channel, and  online  thirdparty intermediaries like Expedia and Travelocity. Increasingly, the  Internet  will  become your  key  distribution  channel, but  in  the meantime, you must manage two parallel systems, the  traditional  central  reservation  and travel agency channels and the new electronic channels. Are  the  rooms  you  want  to  offer\n\navailable in both systems, with helpful and upto-date information? Are your prices sensible in each outlet? Making the hotel available is no longer a passive stance but an active part of your marketing.\n\nIn  other  industries, distribution  channel revolutions  have  brought  efficiencies  that benefit both consumers and suppliers. In the travel distribution revolution now underway, the consumer has benefited, but costs to hotels-the suppliers-have skyrocketed. Since 1993, full-service  hotel  costs  of  distribution (commissions, Global  Distribution  System fees, and  reservation  expenses)  more  than doubled, to  $1,377  per  occupied  room  per year in 2002 (PKF, 2003).\n\nAlong with these new channels and thirdparty room merchants has come pressure on prices. In the downturn of 2001-2003, this was devastating. Price comparisons are quick and easy for the consumer. Packagers and auction sites, like  Priceline.com, unconsciously  cultivate the destructive idea that a hotel room is a commodity, as is an airline seat. But hotels are not commodities; each differs in location, features, and benefits. A hotel team must resist the idea that a room is a room is a room, must emphasize their hotel's distinctive positioning, and  must  resist  the  urge  to  simply match the lowest price offered.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, both the traditional  and  Internet-based  distribution  systems  will  coexist  and  have  to  be  managed. This raises a new question: What channels do you  want  to  encourage, and  what  ones  discourage?  Conventional  wisdom, in recent years, has been to make the hotel's inventory and  rates  available  via  as  many  channels  as possible  so  as  to  capture  from  anywhere  in the world the last drop of demand for arrival on a given day. Given their sharply differing costs, however, and the difficulty of managing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "Bianca Grohmann and Eric Spangenberg\n\nConsumers'  choices  are  influenced  by  the goals they attempt to achieve. Once a person has recognized a need, such as the need for accommodation when traveling for business or pleasure, he or she engages in an information search to identify alternatives from which to choose. Understanding how consumers evaluate  competing  alternatives  in  their  purchase decision  processes  enables  marketers  in  the hospitality industry to design better advertising  and  promotional  campaigns  leading  to  a more favorable evaluation of their offerings in travelers' eyes. This is an important step in increasing  the  likelihood  that  consumers  will choose  their  offering  as  opposed  to  that  of competitors. Given that most travelers' destinations  offer  several  hotels, how  do  people choose among them? The answer to this question  lies, in  part, in  research  on  consumers' attitudes and their relation to purchase intentions and subsequent purchase behavior. This chapter describes several methods consumers\n\nmay use to make choices based on the evaluation of identified alternatives.\n\nAttitude is  the  tendency  to  respond  in  a consistently favorable or unfavorable manner toward a target (e.g., brand or product). Important to marketers is that, if measured accurately, attitudes are predictive of behavioral intentions  and  relatively  stable  over  time. Simply put, consumers generally form intentions  to  choose  a  hotel  brand  toward  which they hold positive attitudes. Behavioral intentions, however, do  not  always  translate  into corresponding  behavior. For  example, although  some  consumers  have  preferences and therefore form intentions to stay at Fairfield  Inn  when  traveling  across  the  country, they might end up choosing other forms of accommodation from time to time. Why would they act inconsistently with their intentions? Traveling with friends who have different attitudes  and  preferences, temporary  price  reductions  of  competitors, or  the  fact  that  a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFairfield Inn is not readily available in a specific area might be reasons for inconsistencies between  behavioral  intentions  to  stay  at  a Fairfield Inn and actual choice behavior.\n\nDespite situational factors sometimes influencing travelers' choices, attitudes are ultimately  useful  in  predicting  actual  behavior; changing  or  strengthening  the  basis  of  consumer  attitudes  may  therefore  increase  the likelihood of consumers engaging in desired behaviors. In  order  to  change  attitudes  and subsequent related behavior, marketers must understand a few basic decision rules associated with consumer attitudes. Below we introduce decision rules likely to be implemented by  different  segments  of  consumers  under varying market conditions.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "D ecision rules are strategies consumers use to choose  among  alternatives. Several  factors can  influence  what  decision  rule  consumers ultimately apply in a specific situation. Typically, the more important and less frequent a purchase decision is, the more time and effort consumers are willing to expend making that decision. Choosing a resort at which to spend a twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, for example, is  a  decision  most  consumers  face  only once and therefore are likely to take a relatively long time to make, and they are likely to  be  careful  and  thorough  in  evaluating  alternatives. On the other hand, a salesperson traveling  frequently  in  a  familiar  territory likely chooses a hotel using a routine process where  far  less  time  and  consideration  are given to alternatives. Further, brand-loyal customers  might  choose  to  stay  with  the  same hotel chain whenever possible, thereby avoiding  a  situation  where  they  are  forced  to\n\nchoose  among  alternatives. In  general, the stronger  a  consumer  is  motivated  to  search and  the  greater  the  risk  associated  with  a choice, the greater the complexity of the decision rule he or she implements.\n\nAnother important characteristic of modeling  decisions  is  the  fact  that  (counterintuitively and often counterattitudinally) people often do not attempt to optimize choice. If a person's goal is optimal choice, considerably more time and effort is typically required to identify and evaluate alternatives. Therefore, consumers often choose a satisfactory (as opposed to optimal) alternative (as opposed to the best alternative possible) in order to save time and effort. The use of decision rules in these instances enables people to take shortcuts in making decisions in the face of the apparently unlimited or overwhelming amounts of  information  available  regarding  all  possible alternatives. Consumers usually work with a  consideration  set  (i.e., a  subset  of  alternatives from the entire universe of choices) so they do not have to work as hard cognitively when required to make a decision in a given product category. They then make a final decision  from  this  reduced  set  of  alternatives. Such decision rules are referred to as heuristics or  rules  of  thumb. Employing heuristics, people save time and limit complex information processing while still making reasonable or satisfactory choices based on the few brand attributes or characteristics most important to them at the time of choice. In the context of hotel choice, brand attributes are things like location, room  rates, and  availability  of  a swimming pool, restaurant, and so forth.\n\nAlthough the number of consumer decision rules is almost infinite and likely varies by consumer, basic categories and a few specific examples serve as useful tools in modeling  and  predicting  traveler  decisions. Two\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngeneral  categories  of  decision  rules  are  (1) compensatory and (2) noncompensatory. Below we discuss how travelers make decisions using these two types of rules.\n\n",

      "title": "▶ Compensatory Decision Rules",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Compensatory  decision  rules  model  consumers as  deriving  an  overall  brand  evaluation such that alternatives performing poorly on one attribute can compensate for their respective shortcomings by positive evaluations of other attributes. For example, a high-priced hotel might not be perceived positively on the dimension  of  room  rates  by  some  travelers; however, these same travelers might be willing to spend more money knowing they will receive better service or that the hotel is conveniently  located-that  is, in  this  example, service and location compensate for the perceived disadvantage of high room rates. The multi-attribute  attitude  model  described  in the next section is perhaps the most popular compensatory decision rule.\n\nMulti-attribute Attitude Model. The multi-attribute  attitude  model  we  describe herein is also referred to as a weighted additive model or the Fishbein (1975) linear compensatory  model. In  this  model, people  not only assess the value of each salient (or important) attribute of brand but also consider the  extent  to  which  a  given  alternative  possesses the attributes. ( Note: In this context, it is important to note that salience is essentially equivalent  to  importance. Further, the  attributes salient to one market segment may be very different from those of another segment. For example, business travelers may not care at all about a spa, an airport shuttle, and room service  breakfast  quality, while  to  another\n\nmarket  segment, these  property  attributes may be very  important.) The  evaluations  of salient attributes and the beliefs that brands possess the salient attributes are included as weights  in  an  equation  determining  overall brand attitude. The model is represented as:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nwhere Abrand A is the overall attitude toward hotel brand A, ei is the evaluative weight associated  with  attribute i , bi is  the  extent  to which  the  consumer  believes  brand  A  possesses attribute i (i.e., strength of belief that i is present in brand A), and n is the number of salient attributes in consideration.\n\nOperators  and  marketers  typically  measure importance weights and strengths of beliefs using questionnaires. First, survey respondents are asked to provide evaluative weights associated with each of the attributes salient to their decision; these numbers represent each attribute's relative positive or negative associations in consumers' minds. Although  scale  endpoints  may  vary  by  researcher  preference, our  demonstration  of this model assumes use of a 7-point scale on which -3 is the lowest importance rating possible, + 3 is the highest, and a neutral importance  rating  is  zero. An  attribute  that  is evaluated  entirely  negatively  by  survey  respondents (e.g., the availability of guest laundry)  would  be  assigned  a  value  of -3, whereas an attribute that is highly positive in a  consumer  segment's  evaluation  (e.g., low room rates) might be assigned a value of + 3.\n\nOnce consumer attribute evaluations are determined, survey respondents state the extent in which they believe a brand possesses respective attributes. Again, for simplicity of demonstration, we  assume  that  the  belief strength regarding any of the attributes to be\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nevaluated ranges between -3 (i.e., the brand definitely does not possess the attribute) and + 3 (the brand definitely possesses the attribute). For example, if a traveler believes that Hotel X is a relatively high-priced establishment, the  consumer  might  assign  a  belief value of -2 to this hotel on the attribute 'low room rates,' thereby indicating that Hotel X does not possess the attribute 'low price' to a great  extent. In  other  words, Hotel  X  performs poorly on the traveler's low room rate criterion. The hotel offering the absolute lowest  price-say, Hotel  Q-may  be  assigned  a value of + 3 on the attribute 'low room rates,' thereby  indicating  the  traveler  strongly  believes  that  Hotel  Q  does  indeed  offer  low room rates.\n\nThe next step in the model is multiplication  of  attribute  evaluation  ( ei )  and  belief strength ( bi ) for each of the salient attributes. If the traveler evaluated low room rates very positively ( e room rate = + 3), and Hotel X received a belief score of b room rate =-2, we calculate  Hotel  X's  contribution  to  overall attitude  score  relative  to  the  attribute  'low room rate' by multiplying evaluation and belief  scores e room  rate × b room  rate = ( + 3) × ( -2) =-6. Evaluation of Hotel Q on the low room rate attribute will be more favorablespecifically, e room rate × b room rate = + ( 3) × ( + 3) = 9. This procedure is followed for each salient attribute for all brands in a consideration set. Other attributes, for example, could include location near the airport, availability of room service, or complementary breakfast, and  the e attribute × b attribute products  calculated for each brand and attribute.\n\nFinally, the  products  of ei × bi for  each salient attribute are summed for each brand. The  resulting  scores  represent  the  relative overall  attitudes  held  for  each  brand. This weighted additive model is applied to all the brands included in the survey as the consider-\n\ntion  set, and  the  brand  associated  with  the highest overall attitude score is selected as the preferred alternative.\n\nA  few  considerations  should  be  kept  in mind that are important to implementation of this model. First is the notion that the model is  relative  in  nature-that  is, an  overall  attitude  score  of + 21  for  a  single  hotel  means nothing  unless  it  is  compared  to  the  overall attitude scores of its competitors as evaluated by  survey  respondents  in  a  relevant  market segment. Further, it is important to include all relevant competitors in the model. As a relative model, it may be that the market segment considers only one of five low-budget properties when traveling to a particular locale. If so, include  only  those  five; it  is  not  helpful  to have comparisons made (explicitly or implicitly) in respondents' minds if they are not realistic  (e.g., it  is  likely  that  inclusion  of  the Four  Seasons  in  the  consideration  sets  of Quality  Inn  customers  is  inappropriate). By the same token, leaving out alternatives that respondents in the market segment may truly consider can introduce error; the result may be a finding that the property has the highest attitude  score  among  those  included  on  the survey, yet  the  model  is  not  predictive  because the survey omitted a strong competitor. Also  of  paramount  importance  is  the  selection  of  appropriate  salient  attribute  sets. If critical, differentiating  attributes  are  left  out of  the  model, summated scores are not predictive  of  behavioral  likelihood; consumers using a compensatory model in actuality are implicitly  calculating  scores  using  attributes that may have been missed by survey administrators. Thus, it is critical to select the appropriate  salient  attributes  for  inclusion  in  the model. Note that appropriate does not mean all attributes. Surveyors  often  ask  about things  that  do  not  really  matter  to  respondents. Once  primed, however, respondents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprovide a score on attributes they may never have  thought  of  on  their  own, thereby  contributing  falsely  (positively  or  negatively)  to overall attitude scores.\n\nWe now provide an example of the linear compensatory  model, necessarily  simplified with regard to number of brands under consideration  and  salient  attributes  included. Consider Charlie and Elsa Brown, a wealthy New York couple looking for a hotel to stay at while spending a weekend skiing in Vermont; the Browns represent a market segment that regularly  visits  this  area  for  this  purpose. Based on a discussion with friends who know the area well, the Browns identified four hotels (associated with four different brands) in the  area  they  plan  to  visit. Table  7.1  shows four  salient  attributes  the  Browns  consider, the  importance  of  each  attribute  ( ei ranging from -3  to + 3)  and  the  beliefs  ( bi ranging from + 3 to -3) regarding the extent to which each  of  the  properties  possesses  attribute i . (Note  that  there  could  be  more  or  fewer salient attributes depending on the product or service  in  consideration  and  the  attributes salient to the perspective market segment.)\n\nUsing the above scores derived from survey  responses, we  derive  an  overall  attitude score  for  each  of  the  hotels  in  the  Browns' consideration by computing the sums of the products of importance ( ei ) multiplied by belief  strength  ( bi )  for  each  attribute  for  each brand. For example, for Brand E:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nNote that the evaluation weights ( ei )  assigned  to  attributes  remain  constant  across brands, while belief strength may differ from brand to brand (indeed, should differ, unless brands are identical). The overall attitude toward hotels E, F, G, and H can therefore be calculated as follows:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThus, assuming an optimized score being sought in this instance, Hotel F, scoring highest  in  overall  brand  attitude  (17), is most likely  to  be  chosen. Hotel  E, on  the  other hand, scored lowest on overall brand attitude (2), and is unlikely to be selected.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Although  many  factors  (e.g., high  involvement, high physical, social, or economic risk) associated  with  a  decision  may  lead  consumers to use a compensatory decision rule, the effort is relatively complicated and often too  time-  and  effort-intensive  for  people  to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 7.1 Four Salient Attributes K Considers\n\nemploy  for  many  day-to-day  decisions. As suggested above, consumers may use a compensatory decision rule if they spend a lot of time on the road, for a special vacation, or for an extended stay abroad. However, they are unlikely to use such an elaborate rule when purchasing  a  beverage  at  a  gas  station  or when they need to find inexpensive lodging in the  middle  of  a  long  drive  to  visit  friends. Thus, many  decisions  are  made  using  much simpler  rules. Noncompensatory  decision rules  tend  to  simplify  decision  making; they may  lead  to  less  than  optimized  results  but are often employed when consumers satisfice, or  seek  an  outcome  that  is  good  enough rather than optimal.\n\nWhen  noncompensatory  decision  rules are used, a brand or product cannot compensate  for  weak  performance  on  one  attribute by performing well on other attributes when competing alternatives are compared. For example, if consumers choose a hotel based on the  single  criterion  attribute  of  low  room rates, a  hotel  offering  higher-priced  accommodations  with  better  service  would  not  be chosen (unless rooms are not available at the hotel offering lower rates). In this case, consumers do not trade off room rates and service  quality  but  make  their  decision  guided solely by a property's rates.\n\nThe  most  commonly  used  noncompensatory decision rules are the lexicographic decision rule, the elimination-by-aspects decision rule, and  the conjunctive  decision  rule. To demonstrate consumers' use of noncompensatory decision rules, we can use the same survey data as the compensatory decision model regarding  salient  attribute  evaluations  and brand beliefs regarding those attributes. The data, however, are  used  differently, as  described below. For the noncompensatory rules defined below, we again consider the evaluations and beliefs regarding Hotels E, F, G, and H introduced in Table 7.1.\n\nLexicographic  Decision  Rule. When  using  a  lexicographic  decision  rule, consumers select  a  brand  according  to  the  alternative that  scores  highest  on  a  single  attribute deemed most important. This is probably the way  we  make  a  lot  of  decisions. What  is cheapest? What is most convenient? What is the best-looking alternative?\n\nConsider the values in Table 7.1 as results of a different survey for consumers from a different market segment: Four brands of hotels are evaluated on the four attributes of proximity to skiing area, low rates, fine restaurant, and indoor pool. The importance of each of these attributes is given by ei . Importance ratings  are  proximity  to  skiing  area  ( + 3), low\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrates  ( -2), fine  restaurant  ( + 1)  and  indoor pool  ( + 2). Proximity  to  skiing  area  is  the most important attribute in this case of hotel choice, followed by indoor pool, fine restaurant, and low rates, respectively. According to the  lexicographic  decision  rule, proximity  to skiing area is the attribute determining consumer  choice  in  this  case. Consumers  have reason to believe that Hotel G is closer to the slopes ( b proximity to skiing G = + 3) than are the other  hotels  in  the  consideration  set, and therefore Hotel G is chosen.\n\nElimination  by Aspects. When an elimination-by-aspects decision rule is used, attributes  are  again  ranked  according  to  their importance. Unlike choosing the hotel brand that performs best on a single most important attribute as with the lexicographic rule, however, elimination by aspects involves the use of  cutoff  values. A cutoff value is a minimal performance score a brand must have to stay in  the  consumer's  consideration  set. A  consumer  first  looks  at  performance  scores  of brands  regarding  the  most  important  attribute and eliminates all brands that do not exceed  the  predetermined  cutoff  value. We often do this with multiple attributes:'I won't pay  more  than  $110  a  night  in  city  X, so  I don't even look at properties more expensive than  that, but  my  choice  also  has  to  have  a pool.' We essentially eliminate by the aspect of price first and then by whether or not the hotel has a pool.\n\nIn the example shown in Table 7.1, proximity to skiing area is the most important attribute, with an importance rating of + 3. Let us assume the consumer's cutoff value is + 2. That means that all of the hotel brands that have a score of at least + 2 on the proximity to skiing area attribute are retained in the consideration set, while brands that do not meet this  cutoff  criterion  are  dropped  from  the\n\nconsumer's consideration set. For this example, only Hotel F ( b proximity to skiing area F =+ 2) and Hotel G ( b proximity to skiing area =+ 3) meet the cutoff criterion ( + 2). Hotel E ( b proximity to skiing area E =-1) and Hotel H ( b proximity to skiing  area  H = + 1)  are  not  close  enough  to  the skiing area to make the cut.\n\nWhen  implementing  the  elimination-byaspects decision rule, the consumer replicates these steps: He or she now considers the performance  of  the  remaining  brands  with  respect  to  the  attribute  ranked  second-highest in importance. In our example, the consumer next looks at the availability of an indoor pool at Hotels F and G. Assuming the cutoff value to be employed is + 2, both brands remain in the  consumer's  consideration  set, as  the scores for indoor pool Hotel F ( b indoor pool F = + 2)  and  Hotel  G  ( b indoor pool G = + 3)  both meet  this  criterion. At  this  point, the  consumer has not yet found the best offering according to the elimination-by-aspects rule.\n\nConsequently, the  consumer  applies  the same  procedure  to  the  attribute  ranked third-that is, the availability of a fine restaurant. Assuming the consumer still uses a cutoff criterion of + 2, Hotel G ( b fine restaurant G = -1) is eliminated from the consideration set. Hotel F ( b fine restaurant F = + 3), on the other hand, exceeds the cutoff criterion, is now the only brand left in the consumer's consideration set, and is therefore selected.\n\nNote  that  using  the  same  data  set, the elimination-by-aspects decision rule leads to a different choice than the lexicographic decision rule. From a strategic standpoint, the fact that  some consumers use an elimination-byaspects decision rule should encourage hotels to  improve their performance on several attributes  important  in  consumer  choice. It  is not  enough  to  be  situated  close  to  a  skiing area. Other aspects of the offering might also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbe important in consumers' hotel selections, and  performance  in  these  areas  should  be monitored  and, if  necessary, improved. You can see, however, that it is crucial to improve services  that  are  valued  by  consumers-in other words, aspects of a hotel's offering that have  high  importance  ratings. Shortcomings in  aspects  that  are  valued  highly  by  consumers, such  as  cleanliness  and  employee friendliness, cannot  be  compensated  for  by strong  performance  in  areas  to  which  consumers  attach  no  importance  (e.g., internal cost-control systems).\n\nConjunctive Decision Rule. When a conjunctive decision rule is employed, consumers process information by brand, as opposed to attribute  by  attribute, as  with  the  lexicographic  and  the  elimination-by-aspects  decision rules.With this rule, consumers establish a cutoff criterion that must be met by alternatives in the consideration set on all salient attributes for brands to remain in consideration.\n\nLet  us  assume  that  a  consumer  desires that the chosen hotel should have a score of at least + 1 on all of the attributes he or she considers important. In our example, then, proximity to a skiing area, low rates, fine restaurant, and indoor pool must all rate a + 1 on each of these dimensions to remain in the consideration set. First, the  consumer  evaluates  Hotel  E  on  each  of  these  attributes. While Hotel E meets the cutoff criterion of + 1 on fine restaurant, it falls short of the consumer's cut-off rule when it comes to proximity to skiing area, low rates, and indoor pool, and  therefore  is  eliminated  from  consideration. The  consumer then turns to evaluation of Hotel F, which meets the cutoff value of + 1 on three out of four relevant attributes. It is eliminated  from  choice  consideration, however, due to its failure to deliver on low rates. The consumer's assessment of  Hotel  G  also\n\nleads  to  elimination  from  choice  consideration because it does not meet the cutoff criterion of + 1 on the attribute 'fine restaurant.' Hotel H, on the other hand, exceeds the cutoff criterion of + 1 on all of the criteria. Thus, using a conjunctive decision rule, Hotel H is selected.\n\nAccounting  for  Ties. Note  that  ties  can frequently occur using compensatory or noncompensatory decision rules; this usually results  in  consumers  moving  to  a  new  rule  in order  to  break  the  tie. For  example, if  compensatory values were equal for two competitors  (not  shown  in  the  examples  above), a consumer  might  implement  a  lexicographic decision rule with proximity to a skiing area as the most important attribute used to pick a hotel. Or, if the conjunctive cutoff value were -1 for all attributes, both Hotels E and H in our example would stay in consideration; the consumer may then use a lexicographic decision  rule  based  on  availability  of  an  indoor pool, resulting in Hotel H being chosen as it is rated higher on this attribute than Hotel E.\n\n",

      "content": "O nce  consumer  evaluations  of  salient  attributes (e.g., availability  of  room  service, conference  facilities, wheelchair  accessibility, children's  programs)  are  determined  and their  beliefs  regarding  a  hotel  brand's  offerings are known, managers can use this information  to  improve  their  hotel's  competitive positioning  in  the  market. The  goal  of  any marketing strategy is to increase positive attitude toward the offering or to encourage the use of certain decision rules, thereby increasing the likelihood of being chosen by consumers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we have seen, when consumers use a compensatory decision rule, the  overall  attitude toward a hotel is determined by the sum of  the  products  of  evaluations  multiplied  by beliefs regarding salient attributes associated with  the  offering. Consequently, travelers' overall  attitudes  toward  a  hotel  can  be  rendered more positive by strategies targeted at increasing  the  evaluation  of  an  attribute  in consumers' decision making, or by changing consumers' beliefs about a hotel's offerings.\n\nTravelers'  attribute  evaluations  can  be influenced by stressing the attribute in advertising (e.g., less money spent on accommodation can be used to have more fun with the whole  family  by  spending  the  savings  on other activities, the availability of a business center  enables  business  customers  to  save time). This  strategy  of  influencing  attribute evaluations  is  effective  in  attitude  change and also relatively easy to pursue. It is, however, not a strategy always recommended for changing consumers' attitudes when they are using  a  compensatory  model. The  potential problem associated with this approach is that attribute  evaluations  are  constant  across brands in a consideration set. In our example above, travelers evaluating importance of the availability  of  an  indoor  pool  ( + 2)  is  the same for all hotel brands, E, F, G, and H. If Hotel H were successful in a marketing message in increasing the evaluation of an indoor pool  with  a  segment  of  consumers, say  to  a rating  of + 3, it  would  increase  consumers' overall attitude toward its brand.At the same time, however, consumers' overall evaluation of  Hotel  G  would  increase  by  the  same amount, as both brands do not differ with respect to consumers' beliefs about their having  a  great  indoor  pool  (i.e., both  have  a belief rating of + 3). In the end, the attempt to  increase  consumers'  overall  attitude  to-\n\nward Hotel H would also benefit some of its competitors.\n\nThus, sometimes a more effective strategy for improving consumers' overall attitude toward  a  hotel's  offerings  is  to  improve  consumers'  brand-specific  belief  ratings. For example, Hotel F could strive to improve consumer belief that  it  offers  a  pleasant  indoor pool by providing a picture of the pool on its website, or by stressing the availability of the indoor  pool  in  advertisements. While  consumer brand-specific beliefs are then likely to increase, Hotel F's competitors will not benefit from its strategy, and Hotel F thereby improves its competitive position.\n\nAssuming  that  Hotel  E  cannot  do  anything  to  increase  consumers'  belief  that  it  is not located in proximity of a skiing area (i.e., its location is indeed far from a skiing resort), a  strategy  it  may  employ  to  increase  consumers' overall attitude toward the property is  to  add  a  salient  attribute  to  the  set  of  attributes consumers consider when making hotel choices. For  example, Hotel  E  could provide  free  accommodation  for  children staying with their parents. It is likely that parents  would  consider  this  option  important when choosing a hotel. As long as other competitors do not offer this service, Hotel E enjoys some advantage in the choices made by its  target  market. It  is  essential  that  when adding  a  new  attribute, marketers  consider the following: First, the attribute added must be  important  enough  to  the  hotel's  target market  to  be  included  in  consumers'  subsequent  decision  making  (i.e., is it indeed salient?). Second, the belief that a particular hotel possesses this attribute must be stronger than the belief that any of its competitors do. This marketing strategy, often referred to as a strategy  of  differentiation, is likely  to  be successful  when  these  conditions  are  met.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDifferentiation, however, is unlikely to be sustainable-that is, over time, competitors identify what added attributes successfully attract customers  and  copy  them, thereby  creating consumer belief regarding their own properties. Thus, the hotel that introduced the new salient  attribute  often  can  expect  to  lose  its differential  advantage  over  time  unless  it maintains a unique characteristic like a special  location  (e.g., 'there  is  only  one  view property  on  this  section  of  coastline')  or  a fabulous chef in the kitchen.\n\nIncreasing belief strength for a hotel's attributes is not always a successful strategy, assuming a compensatory model is being used. For example, consumers may find it relatively unimportant  whether  the  hotel  offers  low room  rates  or  not. In  the  example  data  in Table 7.1, the importance rating for low room rates is -2-that is, consumers in this particular  target  segment  evaluate  low  room  rates negatively, perhaps  because  they  associate low rates with low quality or with small, underfurnished rooms. In this case, stressing that a particular hotel offers low rates, thereby increasing  the  strength  of  consumers'  beliefs, may adversely affect consumers' overall evaluation of a property. If you compare Hotels F and H, you will see that the strong belief that Hotel H offers low rates ( b low rates  H = + 2) negatively  affects  its  overall  evaluation, as ( e low  rates × b low  rates  H ) = -( 2)( + 2) = -4. Hotel F, on the other hand, benefits from consumers not being aware of low rates, such that ( e low rates × b low rates F ) = -( 2)( -2) =+ 4.\n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  importance weights associated with attributes vary across market segments. For example, while business travelers  on  corporate  expense  accounts  or consumers  on  a  once-in-a-lifetime  vacation, such as a honeymoon, may attach less importance to low rates, more price-sensitive mar-\n\nket  segments  usually  weigh  low  rates  more heavily  in  their  hotel  choice. It  is  therefore important  for  marketers  to  carefully  define the targeted market segment(s) prior to conducting  their  research  and  applying  evaluation weights and beliefs to similarly disposed consumers.\n\nIn general, it is crucial to find out what attributes  targeted  consumers  feel  are  most salient to their decisions and, in response, increase  performance  (or  perceived  performance) regarding these attributes and commensurately inform market segments of this  stronger  position. The  resultant  positive attitude  toward  the  offering  should  then  increase the likelihood of the hotel being chosen by travelers using a compensatory decision-making  model. Alternatively, as  a strategic  move, particularly  for  special  niche properties, marketers may want to encourage consumers to abandon the linear compensatory model. Niche market segments may exist or  may  be  created  through  marketing  communications; these  target  markets  might  be better  served  by  hotels  focusing  on  one  or more of the noncompensatory decision rules presented. For example, a segment of highly price-sensitive  customers  predominantly  using  a  lexicographic  decision  rule  with  low rates  as  the  most  important  attribute  may constitute  the  primary  target  market  for  a property. In  this  case, travelers  can  be  targeted by offering low prices and/or frequentstay  loyalty  programs. At  the  same  time, services deemed unnecessary or unimportant by this  customer segment can be eliminated or  minimized. The  fact  that  some  customer segments  expect  a  minimal  level  of  performance on several attributes (e.g., cleanliness, convenience, and friendly service) when they use  an  elimination-by-aspect  or  conjunctive decision rule, however, implies that focusing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nperformance and/or marketing on a single attribute may be inadequate for some segments of travelers. A hotel would then benefit from creating a level of 'at least acceptable' attributes in addition to providing stronger packages of the same  attributes offered by competitors  targeting  the  same  market  segment. Overall, knowing how consumers make decisions should help hotel managers to design better properties, packages, and services, and help them market those offerings to their respective target segment(s), thereby improving competitive position.\n\n",

Strategy  3: Hotel  Lion  could encourage  consumers  to  consider  other relevant attributes when choosing accommodation for trade show visits or conference attendance. These attributes should be associated with a strong performance by Hotel Lion and a weaker performance by other competitors. For example, Hotel Lion might introduce a shuttle service to important conference and trade show locations to make it convenient for business travelers  and  conference  participants  to reach their destination; they could also offer  a  coffee  shop  for  short  breaks  and breakfast suited for their target segments' busy schedules, and/or introduce secretarial or other business services for travelers.\n\nrestaurant quality; it would also be possible  to  strengthen  consumers'  belief  that Hotel Lion offers an excellent restaurant by  increasing  marketing  communications.

If the targeted  segments  rely  primarily  on  a compensatory decision rule using importance  weights  described  in  Table  7.2 above, then establishing or maintaining a nice  restaurant  may  be  counterproductive, as these consumers do not positively value  that  attribute  ( ei = -1).

      "content": "T he single most important criterion of success in any business, including hotels, is profit. The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance  of  hotel  pricing  and  its  influence  on yield  or  revenue  management, especially  in terms of profit generation, and because of inherent dangers to the industry worldwide, integrity  of  the  established  pricing  structure. Historically, price has been determined by the triangular relationship of cost and demand in the  context  of  competition  (see  Figure  7.3). The actual pricing structure is developed with one of these three components as the deciding  factor  while  the  other  two  play  supplementary roles.\n\nThe traditional pricing strategy was largely  cost-driven. Many  hotel  operators tended  to  favor  the  rule-of-thumb  method. This  approach, also  called  the  $1  per  $1,000 rule, states that hotels should charge approximately $1 per night for every $1,000 of room cost, based  on  an  average  70  percent  occu-\n\nChelsea  stay  in  consideration  based  on beliefs about those brands regarding the equally important attributes of low rates and location.

Finally, we eliminate Hotel Park and select Hotel Union based on the Internet access attribute  (lowering  the  cutoff  value  to + 1).\n\npancy. Although popular in its day, the calculation  of  cost  was  commonly  misunderstood (see  Hanson, 1995). Another  widely  used quantitative  method  was  the  Hubbart  Formula, developed  in  the  late  1940s  as  a guideline issued by the American Hotel Association. It  focused  on  computing  an  average room rate that would cover operational costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nand yield a reasonable return on investment (ROI). These quantitative methods are fairly static  and  therefore  suited  for  a  stable  economic  environment. Qualitative  pricing  approaches, such  as  percentage  increase  of previous-year  rates  adjusted  for  inflation, payroll  increases, and  new  cost  of  supplies, reflect more realistically the projected cost.\n\nOther qualitative techniques are less ex-\n\nact  but, by  being  competition-oriented, they offer  more  flexibility. The  Pied  Piper  or Follow-the-Leader  method  uses  competition as the basis for rate setting, while the Gouge 'Em  approach  tries  to  lure  business  away from  other  properties  by  undercutting  their prices. If there is no competition to speak of, Hit or Miss fluctuation of rates tied to profitable  occupancy  levels  could  be  employed.\n\nTable 7.3 Traditional Room Rate-Setting Methods\n\nSource: DeVeau, L.T., P.M.

An  effective approach, therefore, calls for a mix of methods adjusted  for  different  situations  (see  Table 7.3).The fundamental question remains:What should be the driving force in formulating a sound  pricing  strategy?  In  today's  dynamic business environment, which discards the traditional  view  that  market  demand  for  room rates  is  largely  inelastic, demand  orientation seems to provide the best fit.\n\n",

When  the  chain  is  setting  its  prices, it starts  with  comprehensive  market  research. Based on the data, the correct price for each marketplace is determined. If there is a major shift  in  a  market, then  the  prices  will  adjust for that. However, if there is a major shift in a demand curve, then a shift of price may have no effect. It may actually leave more money on the table. For example, if the airlines go on strike, a significant shift in the demand curve would result. Under such conditions, decreasing the rate by $50, for example, would only result in a $50 loss. If there is an opportunity to go after a new targeted market with a specific  offer, enabling  the  chain  to  capture  a greater market share, then lowering the rate serves its purpose. Generally, however, lowering rates across the board is not the preferred pricing strategy.\n\n",

      "content": "W hile independently owned properties make their own pricing decisions, in case of a chain it is usually corporate headquarters (HQ) that sets pricing guidelines. Often, individual properties are still responsible for the actual pricing. Because they are held accountable, they must balance corporate guidelines with their autonomy  to  set  their  prices. Caroline  Shin, member of the revenue management team at Starwood  Hotels  and  Resorts  Worldwide, which  operates  a  number  of  upscale  brands, such  as  Sheraton  and W  Hotels, stresses  the cooperative  nature  of  this  relationship. Successful pricing strategies arise from an ongoing  interaction  of  both  sides. Corporate  HQ provides sophisticated tools and in-depth market analysis that would be beyond reach of individual properties. Property managers, on the other hand, offer their experience and knowledge of regional specifics that may have gone unnoticed by the corporate team.'The people who have been in the property understand the dynamics of that market, and they have developed  pricing  intuition,' explains  Shin.

Recent  research  shows  that  two-thirds  of managers  making  strategic  decisions  under pressure and time constraints use a combina-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntion of analysis and intuition (Sinclair, 2003). The  advent  of  modern  technology, such  as yield management software packages, has further  strengthened  this  link. 'Even  the  most sophisticated analytical model for forecasting, may it be for hotel pricing or for thermal dynamics of a nuclear plant, still needs variables based upon assumptions,' says Shin, who used to work as a nuclear engineer.The more business-savvy  hotel  management  becomes  and the more they understand the hotel dynamics and the market, the more can be gained from training them how to define their experiencebased  intuition  and  put  it  into  numbers. In this  respect, an  interaction  between  the  corporate  revenue  management team and individual hotels is paramount. 'Every time I go out  to  a  property, I  learn  something  new. It only  helps  me  when  I  build  my  analytical models  to  almost  translate  what  they  know into numbers,' confirms Shin. The better hotels  can  do  that, the  better  models  they  can develop. Nonetheless, inaccurate  historical data remains a major limitation.\n\nNo  model  is  ever  going  to  be  perfect, though. What seems to work best is to teach hotel managers how to use the model and to understand the direction of the pricing decisions they need to make. That is the scientific part. The art piece comes into play when they infuse the model with their knowledge and intuition. Staff training is an important part of this process. 'We can't just have Ph.D.s sitting in one room coming with all these models and we just roll it out. At the same time, we can't just  have  people  with  intuitions  run  around and set prices,' says Shin.\n\nRevenue management teams must make sure  that  hotels  understand  how  to  employ the  models  in  their  daily  pricing  decisions. When  science  is  applied, the  revenue  team can go to their experts, ask probing questions,\n\nand get solid results. Even though intuition is a part of this process, it is based only on a hypothesis that could have been triggered by a discussion  with  a  customer, knowledge  of what is happening in the marketplace, or historic trends. That is why pure intuition is not sufficient. 'Managers must have reliable data to  support  their  hunches,' cautions  Scott Farrell.\n\n",

While price is a determinator of the customer profile the hotel is looking for, it  is  also  an  indicator  of  the  quality  of services and the market segment the hotel is competing  in. Therefore, yield  management uses  information  about  targeted  customers' purchasing behavior and product sales to develop pricing strategy together with inventory control that delivers products that are better matched to customer needs, create greater demand, and, on that account, produce greater revenues. Lieberman (1993) states that yield management  is  the  process  of  maximizing profits from the sale of perishable assets, such as  hotel  rooms, by  controlling  price  and  inventory  and  improving  service  through  systemization. An exact definition of the target market  is  essential. There  is  a  definite  and firm perception in the psyche of the customer, who views the price as the value forthcoming. Therefore, the  eventual  satisfaction  of  the customer is the paramount task of the pricing mechanism. This is the make-or-break factor of the entire hotel, especially if the value expected does not match the price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "W hile  the  approach  to  hotel  pricing  is  still ruled  by  supply  and  demand, speed  and  sophistication  of  room-rate  yield  or  revenue maximization is now much increased due to two technological factors: yield management software and Internet bookings.\n\nYield management software packages enable hotels to use a higher number of roomrate levels, or buckets, and to control inventory  for  rate  availability  in  real  time. Each level may consist of several room rates open under given conditions to yield a maximum  profit. Traditionally, hotels  used  between  three  and  five  rate  levels; otherwise, the  adjustment  became  too  complex  for  the human brain to work with. The introduction of  software  removed  this  barrier, and  some hotel chains now use up to ten rate levels.This allows  implementation  of  much  narrower ranges for each bucket, thus optimizing price elasticity. This  further  means  the  software model recognizes the point at which the same number  of  bookings  can  be  achieved  at  a higher rate.\n\nOnline monitoring of room inventory in real time facilitates the timing of the adjustment. So far, the biggest limitation is the reliability of historical data. Even in its imperfect form, the system has made a difference. However, hotel  managers  are  fully  aware  that  it takes years to develop brand recognition and quality but just a push of a button to damage or even destroy it, if the pricing is not set up knowledgeably. As  the  technology  becomes more  sophisticated, it will eliminate  such questionable practices as overbooking, which aims at compensating for last-minute cancellations  by  taking  in  more  than  100  percent reservations. Besides the question of whether\n\noverbooking is ethical and, in some countries, even  illegal, better  technology  would  definitely improve the quality of service provided by properties that engage in this practice.\n\nAnother  area  where  technological  advancement had a great impact on hotel pricing is the Internet. Its use as a booking tool has  created  a  new  level  of  pricing  transparency and tiered competition. It also penetrated  the  negotiation  of  corporate  rates. Many hotels see the effect of the Internet as both good and bad.The good side is that website bookings are growing every day. As more customers become familiar with their favorite hotel websites, hotel companies have started investing heavily in website development and upkeep, which gives them several advantages. First, the cost of online bookings is lower than for bookings made through other distribution channels. Companies do not have to pay commission because the booking is direct, circumventing  all  intermediaries. Online  booking also  provides  an  opportunity  to  monitor  inventory in real time without reliance on a distributor willing to share and regularly supply data. Last but not least, it generates loyal customers  by  making  them  eligible  for  bonus points, which they cannot earn if they use an Internet intermediary.\n\nThat is exactly where the flip side of the Internet  lies. The  intermediaries  are  getting more  powerful  and  growing  significantly  in volume. Because most of them show all hotel rates  on  their  website, they  make  the  information accessible to any computer user. One way to meet the challenge of more powerful intermediaries, especially  if  hotels  need  to move inventory, is to utilize  auctions  where the name of the hotel is not disclosed to the customer  until  the  transaction  is  finalized. Such action, however, calls for extreme cau-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntion so that it does not damage a hotel's reputation or threaten its strategic partnerships. As intermediaries become bigger, rate transparency  will  increase  to  the  point  where  it will  drive  the  market, especially  when  computer literacy and Internet access become the norm.\n\nMoreover, the Internet allows nonbranded hotels to compete more heavily with the branded hotels because they can now be displayed  just  as  readily. Without  significant advertising  expense, they  can  compete  on price. For some markets this does not matter, especially when the brand is powerful enough to charge the premium and get the business. In  highly  competitive  markets, however, the competition  creates  an  additional  strain  for the individual property. Many branded hotels must now compete with other brands through the traditional distribution channels and with nonbranded hotels on the Internet, which, in principle, lowers  hotel  rates. A  frequently adopted strategy is to invest heavily in website development and customer loyalty programs, assuring  excellent  website  functionality and that customers are rewarded for booking  directly  through  the  hotel  website rather  than  through  the  website  of  a  thirdparty intermediary. Both Fairmont and Starwood, for  example, utilize  their  high-quality loyalty programs in this way.\n\nInternet  booking  also  changed  the  way corporate  accounts  are  negotiated. Because many companies now require that their employees  make  business  travel  arrangements via the corporate website, the placement of a hotel  or  a  brand  on  this  booking  tool  is  of strategic importance. Being listed first in the accommodation  section, for  example, may bring in a higher volume of business and thus substantiate a lower negotiated rate.\n\n",

Besides using their own websites, hotel companies are also making sure that the cost of their transactions  goes  down  continuously  so  they  can compete  even  at  lower  rates-while  maintaining  a  good  relationship  with  their  carefully selected online intermediaries.\n\nThere is a large number of distributors to choose from. On one end of the spectrum is, for  example, Expedia, which  allows  participating hotels to control their rates, meaning a hotel can change its rates any time it wants.At the  other  end  are  companies, such  as  Hotel Reservation  Network  (HRN), that  bind  hotels contractually to a locked rate that cannot be changed. Some hotel chains do not want to partner  with  these  distributors  because  they like pricing flexibility and want to make sure their rates yield as much as possible.\n\nAdaptation to new technology has been the biggest component of change for intermediaries  as  well. Companies  that  do  not  have the most current technology working in real time or allowing hotels to yield rates in real time are usually not considered a suitable distribution  partner  for  some  chains. On  the other hand, companies that invest in real-time technology  to  yield  rates  are  ideal  partners because, as  the  industry  sees  it, they  work with, not  against  the  industry  by  permitting hotels  to  raise  or  lower  rates  in  real  time. 'They  work  with  us,' says  Caroline  Shin.

It is not enough to state,'We have to do something about our occupancy level.' A pricing campaign must target  a  number  of  sold  rooms  or  generated revenue  that  is  required  in  order  to  break even  or  to  do  better. This  specific  approach injects  efficiency  into  allocating  marketing money to areas where it is most effective and in periods when it is desired. If there is no task direction  or  overall  pricing  leadership, the most creative idea may book only ten roomnights instead of one hundred. It may generate more  customer loyalty, but that is something the hotel may not need at the moment, although it could be an acceptable outcome in a low-season month. Pricing leadership  helps  team  members  understand the hotel's current situation and direct money and creativity  to  do  exactly  what  is  needed. Creativity  comes  up  with  the  idea, which serves  as  a  vehicle, but  spending  marketing money the smart way is a matter of experience in innovation, which turns the idea into a successful  product. Creativity  also  plays  a large part in employee satisfaction, and it lowers turnover.\n\nIn  a  sluggish  economy, some  hotels  start paying attention not only to profit as the bottom line but also to revenue. This means they monitor closely the accrued cost as well as the generated  revenue, thus  achieving  the  maximum yield. Interestingly, contemporary price leadership may take different forms. It could mean, for  example, elimination  of  smoking rooms  throughout  the  property. Many  U.S. motels are revamping rooms, ripping off cigarette-damaged furniture and carpets, and designating  them  as  nonsmoking. This  saves  on maintenance  and  adds  to  overall  packaging flexibility when the business is hurt by lackluster demand. This tactic means drapes, carpets, bedding, and  other  furnishings  must  be  replaced less frequently; it also mitigates fire risk and enhances cleanliness and overall safety.\n\n",

      "content": "S ome large chains recognize that pricing is a complex issue and that they need to get better at it. There is a new focus on analyzing the culture of pricing (how it is being done) and how it can be improved. This approach is reflected even in the kinds of people chains are hiring.\n\nAlthough the majority of staff involved in strategic pricing are in the hotel industry and have a background in revenue management, others are in the airline industry and have indepth travel revenue management experience. Some chains have sought access to this experience by hiring from outside the hotel industry. This is to encourage diversification of thinking and new ways of thought-completely out of the box, as the traditional team members are joined by researchers doing a different kind of optimization  analysis. The  goal  could  be  as radical as trying to manage risk or optimize to-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nward the railroad industry and its scheduling. On the surface, these tactics have nothing to do with revenue management per se. A lot of experience in optimizing difficult travel, however, can only be gained by bringing in people with  different  backgrounds  in  consulting  or with in-depth Internet experience. In order to move pricing and revenue management to a different level of thought, a new mix of people is  necessary. For  this  approach  to  work, adequate training must be in place.\n\nIn  this  respect, basic  HR  functions, such as hiring and training, have an impact on pricing. What is necessary is not only to train personnel in  quantitative  core  skills  but  also  in strategic thinking. For example, when a hotel does not want to take a specific piece of business, it must ask such questions as:What is the revenue? What  is  the  rate? What  am  I  displacing by this decision? Where do I think this will go? How does it help my RevPAR?\n\nHotel managers must become more analytical so they can use all the new tools now available. When  reports  are  created, team members must be taught how to use them. A lot of training must be provided for corporate executives, general  managers, and  regional revenue  directors  as  well. They  all  must  be trained to think more strategically and to understand analysis and the reports so they can help their individual properties.\n\n",

From this perspective, experience is\n\nboth an asset and a liability. It is human nature  to  take  for  granted  the  way  things  are done after being in the same environment for a  while. Therefore, hotel  chains  are  continuously creating and refining pricing strategies to  accommodate  not  only  different  market segments but also different situations a hotel may face based on occupancy levels.\n\nCorporate HQ tries to identify these different situations and associated variables. 'It is almost like a bag of goods, a bag of pricing strategies that should be tested,' says Caroline Shin. Hotels are given the full menu and encouraged to try a certain strategy if they are in a specific situation. Depending on the region, an  individual  property  may  use  one  set  of strategies more than another. In a weak economy, however, the chains have to work harder and  be  more  flexible  because  the  market  is overflowing  with  demand. Adapting  step  by step, a  hotel  may  apply  a  different  strategy every week.The problem for the corporate office is to identify situations a hotel might be in and seek remedy. For example, if group bookings are low this week but competitors are full, how can the property make up the difference with transient or leisure business? The general manager may ask the corporate team, 'What pricing strategies can I use in order to fill my house?' Then he or she may ask, 'What else worked before for other hotels, and what may work for me based on my market specifics and market  characteristics?' That  way  he  or  she can test each strategy using the provided tool and personal experience.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he  corporate  pricing  structure  is  also  in place to support and protect members of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nchain in a number of areas including pricing and  partnerships. The  corporate  office  sets guidelines for hotels in terms of pricing structure and the market segments they deal with. Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, for example, focuses  on  four  segments: transient  leisure travel, group  travel, business  travel, and wholesale. The  corporate  structure  provides guidelines  about  how  the  segments  fit  with each  other, how  they  cross  over, and  where they  reside  in  the  overall  pricing  structure. This  information  is  necessary  because  every segment  acts  differently. Most  market  segments are dynamic and require frequent rate adjustments. One exception is the wholesale market, where pricing is still largely done the traditional way: A wholesaler provides a net rate, marks  it  up, and  sells  it  to  the  general population.There may be a hidden cost, however, if the distribution chain includes an operator  acting  as  a  middleman  between  the wholesaler and the supplier.\n\nWhen setting up the overall pricing structure, one starts with the retail rate, which is a bucket  of  premium  or  best  available  rates (BAR)  charged  on  the  open  market. They usually do not carry any restrictions, such as cancellation  fees, and  they  are  fully  billable. Depending on the level of occupancy, one of these rates is available on any given day when the hotel is not fully booked. It is up to the yield  management  system  to  identify  which BAR to offer.All other rate types, such as discount  rates  and  prenegotiated  rates, are  determined  in  relation  to  the  retail  rate. For instance, a  corporate  rate  for  a  high-volume client  will  be  probably  set  lower  than  the BAR rate that is estimated to sell most during the period when the contract is in place. This way the rates are nested within each other in a manner that makes economic sense.\n\nThe  corporate  pricing  guidelines  follow two main criteria: to maximize revenue and to protect key partnerships.While the hotel sales force negotiates contracts with key partners, such  as  longstanding  corporate  accounts  or wholesale volume accounts, they make sure to protect these partnerships and provide them value. At the same time, they take every opportunity  to  maximize  revenue. One  cannot survive without the other, reiterates Scott Farrell. However, it  is  up  to  the  hotels  themselves, with guidance and additional research, to determine in their marketplace what their pricing structure should look like.\n\nA diversified corporate team, with a mix of people with a hotel industry  background and others skilled in optimization modeling, fulfills an additional function. It acts as a risk prevention  mechanism, a  necessary  prerequisite  for managing  the  risk  inherent  in  pricing. Any chain with a wide variety of hotels must make sure the properties are covered in all kinds of situations. One  risk  containment  scenario might be that the chain, in response to a changing demand curve, acquires a type of business that the brand has not catered to traditionally. Caroline Shin explains, 'Sheraton did not take on  airline  crew  business  because  we  did  not want crew members lingering in the lobby;it affected our brand image. But we thought maybe we could start taking that when our RevPAR index or occupancy slips to a certain point. So we are trying to change the standards of different market segments we are willing to take.'\n\nOn  the  international  scale, another  risk management plan would be analyzing operational cost and determining whether to close down  part  of  the  hotel  if  market  research shows  occupancy  will  not  be  high  enough. When PESTEL (political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, legal)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nanalysis  indicates  demand  will  drop  precipitously for an extended period (due to political unrest, economic crisis, or health scare, for example), instead  of  hoping  for  the  best  and running a full house with a full staff, the hotel may decide to shut down floors or restaurants and save cost until the market picks up again. Selection of the appropriate strategy will depend on the market specifics and protection of  the  image. A  property  may  opt  to  close down  several  floors  over  the  weekend  if  it caters  mostly  to  business  clientele  staying during the week. It would not, however, suspend  room  service, although  unprofitable, if that is considered an integral part of the offered  product. In  a  worst-case  scenario, the chain may decide to sell properties in global risk areas when it determines the external circumstances  make  it  difficult  to  raise  occupancy on an ongoing basis.\n\n",

Understanding the cost of each channel in relation to the value of provided service has an impact on the quality of pricing decisions. Therefore, it is necessary to  determine  how  much  revenue  bookings through  an  Internet  intermediary  generate and  whether  or  not  they  justify  the  accrued cost.There is also a tremendous risk involved. As discussed earlier, one of key guidelines of corporate marketing is that partners are protected. Just  because  there  is  a  new  Internet\n\nsite it does not mean a chain can use it and advertise a lower rate, which would undermine a partnership  of  many  years. In  terms  of  cost, the chain must review its pricing strategy not only by market segment but also by distribution  channel. 'Several  years  ago, we  would not  consider  the  cost  of  distribution  in  our ROI.Today we do,' concedes Scott Farrell.\n\nAnother challenge is to keep up with new Internet  sites. The  chains  must  reevaluate constantly  and  prioritize  their  yield  so  as  to choose which channels to keep or drop. Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, for example, applies the 80-20 rule. They focus on the 20 percent of  the  online  wholesalers  that  capture  more than 80 percent of the business. As Scott Farrell puts it, 'Why would I play with the other 10-12 percent?

Budget and economy properties are driven mostly by financial  considerations, while  upscale  and luxury hotels are more concerned with compatibility. As  for  chains, they  ask  two  basic questions: (1)  How  can  the  partnership  increase  our  brand  recognition  or  a  brand reach, and (2) How much is it going to bring us in terms of revenue or profitability? Their choice has to match the brand first, and then it  has  to  drive  the  revenue. If  the  brand  is equaled  with  quality, online  providers  that project a connotation of cheapness will not be considered at all. The quality image refers not only to the hotel asset itself but also to how and where this asset is sold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFairmont Hotels and Resorts, as a quality brand on the luxury side, cannot compete on price. The  quality  of  their  product  and  the offering of the experience must be considered by  the  customer  at  the  price  being  offered. When their hotels play with price, the corporate  office  watches  closely. Scott  Farrell explains,'If our property wanted to shift their rate  by  $50, I  would  ask  why?  Give  me  the case behind it and tell me what you are going to do to make up the additional $50 you are going to lose. If they come back to me and say they are moving their rate from $300 to $250 while driving a certain volume, I would make them go through the process of determining what  incremental  volume  they  will  need  to make up for the $50 in loss.' In other words, pricing decisions must be driven by ROI, not only  a  feeling. Feelings  and  experience  may be  involved, but  properties  must  present  a strong case based on the estimated ROI and what  they  plan  to  get  out  of  the  proposed strategy. It allows them to go into the pricing change with their eyes open. They also must consider how the competition will respond. A carelessly  lowered  rate  may  lead  to  a  price war.\n\n",

Having eliminated the delay of exposure to marketing collateral material, such as brochures or newspaper advertisements, hotels can conduct targeted discount  mini-campaigns  on  their  own  websites when the yield management system indicates a drop in occupancy for specific dates. In a  similar  manner, brand  recognition  can  be enhanced by a carefully  orchestrated  online\n\nauction. The South African hospitality group Protea (2000) was among the first in the industry  using  this  method  by  offering  their prospective guests the opportunity to bid on a limited number of weekend getaways in their properties  that  needed  to  boost  occupancy. By setting  a  minimum  bidding  price, the  integrity of the hotel image was protected. Similar auction systems, used  to encourage room-night  sales  during  slow  periods, are nowadays available in the United States and Canada via several Internet intermediaries.\n\nFor chains in particular, a long-term strategy  in  distribution  pricing  is  paramount. It stipulates  the  criteria  and  accepts  or  rejects short-term adjustments depending on what is happening in the industry, what is new in the technology, and who the new players are. In terms  of  corporate  hierarchy, pricing  is  formulated  and  executed  on  three  levels: (1) strategy, (2)  tactics  and  execution, and  (3) measurement. Strategy comes first, followed by tactics meant to support that strategy and their execution. Finally, the achieved outcome is measured against the set benchmarks. If the strategy is sound, it will last longer than the other two steps. Frequently, new tactics must be  implemented; these  drive  the  execution and the measurement. This requires a development  of  proprietary  criteria  for  measurement  and  their  continuous  adjustment  to changing conditions.\n\n▶\n\n",

Price elasticity allows hotels to capture customers who do not mind paying the high rate as well as those who are more priceconscious. This  can  be  done  in  a  number  of ways. By  using  different  room  categories, a luxury hotel can have on the same day suites available  at  $500  and  entry-level  rooms  at $200. Every room rate category has a different value proposition associated with the incremental revenue. If the variance between a standard room and a deluxe room is $75, the latter  should  provide  an  adequately  greater value  to  the  customer. The  result  is  a  clear product  differentiation, which  can  be  also achieved by stay restrictions or by the use of fencing. Examples of physical differences, or fences, are room type, view, amenities, and location. Nonphysical fences may mean different  customers, transactions, or  consumption characteristics. These  bear  many  similarities with airline pricing strategies, which differentiate the product by, for example, cancellation restrictions  or  last-minute  availability  of  a prenegotiated  corporate  rate. The  result  is nested pricing, allowing properties to have a very high rate available on the same day as a rate that is more attractive to the lower-end customer.\n\n",

I am responsible for forecasting the number of rooms and the rate at which the guest will pay for a given period. I generate these forecasts based on many critical factors and some less critical. History is always a good indicator of what the future will hold for hotels. The correlation between what happened last year on this day in this month to  what  happens  today  can  be  between  60 percent and 80 percent.\n\nWhat is going on in the area can have a huge impact on the occupancy and rate of a hotel. Local events such as festivals, races, and tournaments can all affect the number of additional  persons  in  the  city  who  need  hotel rooms. The competition can negatively affect your  hotel  by  running  a  special  promotion. On the other side of the coin, the competition can  and  will  create  a  positive  situation  for your hotel when they have abysmal service or a ramshackle product.\n\nOther  factors  that  may  contribute  to  a forecast are additions to the supply of hotel rooms  in  the  area, weather, seasonality, pickup  and  departure  patterns  of  conventions, and  the  ever-changing  local  and  regional  economies. However, when  it  comes down to it, a forecast is exactly that-it is a guess of what we think may happen or what we really want to happen.\n\nOnce  the  forecasts  are  completed, they are  used  to  project  the  amount  of  variable costs associated with running a hotel-for example, labor, or  how  many  housekeepers, front desk clerks, and hash slingers we are go-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ning to need for a given period. Goals are set for sales and catering managers based on the forecast. The  quarterly  and  annual  forecasts are reported to the corporate offices for the purpose of  forecasting  the  entire  company's projected revenues and expenses. In turn, that information is put out to the stockholders and others with a financial stake in the company.\n\nForecasts  and  tracking  of  how  we  did compared to the forecast take up 75 percent of my time. The other 25 percent is spent exploring new opportunities for revenue growth, maintaining  the  various  revenue channels into the hotel, managing the reservations department, acting as the liaison between  the  sales  department  and  operations, and having fun.\n\nAdditional  duties  include  exploring  new revenue channels for the hotel. I  have  been known to visit the local competitor on a particularly  busy  day  and  offer  a  shuttle  to  our hotel and a no-line guarantee-this as the line behind the front desk stretches out the front door and halfway to the street. I am responsible  for  researching  the  demographics  of  the travelers  coming  to  the  area. Why  are  they coming? Are they traveling because of business, conventions, leisure, or are they part of a contract piece of business? How often do they come? How long do they stay? How much do they spend when they come? Where are they coming from?\n\nThe most important thing I do as a revenue manager is to ensure the different revenue  channels  are  set  up  and  functioning properly. These  channels  include  the  hotel brand's  generic  toll-free  vanity  number  and central reservations office, the convention and visitors  bureau, the  local  hotel's  reservation and  front  desk, the  Internet, and  the  global distribution  system  (GDS). The  most  critical of  these  channels  is  the  Internet, which  includes the brand website. Only a few years ago\n\nit was GDS that was the most critical. In our chains, in 2004, Internet channels generated almost twice the volume of the GDS. However, the GDS is still crucial for the survival of almost every hotel. It is the system that travel agents  and  some  of  the  Internet  sites  use  to make reservations at my hotels. It contains information about rates and availability at a hotel. It  must  be  checked  daily  and  routinely maintained. The scary thing about the GDS is that most hotels don't know they have a problem  until  several  months  down  the  road. As technology grows and more and more people stop  calling  and  start  booking  through  their travel agents and directly over the Internet, so does the need to understand the GDS and exactly how it affects the hotel. When one of our competitors initiated a cleanup of their GDS, it  resulted  in  several  million  dollars  in  additional revenue in six months.\n\nManaging the reservations departments is the easy part of my job. Interacting with people  is  always  easier  than  trying  to  interact with numbers and reports. The staff must be kept up to date on changes in strategic goals of the hotel and changes in marketing the discount and frequent-stayer programs. I am responsible for ensuring that the training of the reservations staff and anyone else who takes reservations  is  consistent  and  current, complete with ongoing positive feedback.\n\nIt is key  that  a  revenue  manager  be skilled in the art of diplomacy. As the liaison between  the  operations  and  sales  departments (see Waller, 7.2), I sometimes must mediate any challenges that may occur. Part of the diplomacy is understanding each department's strategic  goals  and  how  both  departments  depend  on  each  other  for  their  own survival. The easiest and simplest approach to serving as a liaison between the two departments  is  facilitating  frequent, open, and honest communication between all parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHaving  fun  is  one  of  my  key  goals  in working at a hotel and in a regional capacity. It  is  important  to  maintain  a  balanced  approach  to  work  in  a  hotel. It  is  easy  to  get burned out trying to do too much. The nature\n\nof the hotel is that it is open 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. Anything that can happen to a person on any given day can happen at a hotel as well.\n\n",

      "content": "S ales  and  marketing  are  related  concepts, and  each  is  an  art  and  a  science. Sales  flow from  marketing. Marketing, well  stated  by Lewis et al. (1995), 'is communicating to and giving  target  market  customers  what  they want, when they want it, where they want it, and  at  a  price  they  are  willing  and  able  to pay.'The primary focus of sales is on the communication  aspect  of  marketing. It  involves direct personal selling to potential customers that you and your organization have the right product, in the right place, at the right time, and at the right price-be it a hotel, a restaurant, a casino, or contract food services.\n\nMarketing  is  getting  and  keeping  a  customer, a macro approach to managing a successful business. In a broad sense, marketing is the development and delivery of a successful product, that is, the development and delivery of a satisfied customer. Hotel sales comprises finding that customer and matching his or her specific needs with the right product offering, a micro or one-on-one approach to customer satisfaction. For  example, a  meeting  planner from Texas Instruments (TI) is planning an annual sales meeting to be held in Dallas. From\n\na macro perspective, this planner has selected the city and is searching for full-service lodging accommodations for 200 TI sales representatives for a five-day conference. From a micro perspective, he or she visits several hotel alternatives and meets with the hotel sales representatives  to  find  the  best  'fit.' Various aspects of the meeting being planned are discussed  including  dates, rates, guest  room  accommodations, function  room  requirements, food and beverage services, and so forth. It is the job of the hotel sales manager to learn the specific  needs  and  wants  of  the  planner  and 'create' the  right  product, place, time, and price for a successful conference.\n\nA successful conference is what the planner  is  really  buying, not  bricks  and  mortar. Thus, successful  selling  is  understanding  the real needs of the buyer, communicating how your product and service can best respond to those needs, and then delivering it. In another context, McDonald's Golden Arches markets fun, simplicity, good service, and a good price. McDonald's sells friendly service, good value for price paid, convenient locations, and those delicious  golden  chicken  nuggets  on  which many of us grew up. Ronald McDonald is an ancillary product, a public relations endeavor,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhich augments and supports the idea or concept of kids and why they are special.\n\nPublic  relations, advertising, and  special promotions  often  support  the  selling  effort. Advertisements  for  the  Ritz-Carlton  Hotel Company are directed to their business traveler  clientele. Such  advertisements  incorporate both the selling and marketing aspects of this  upscale  hotel  chain. The  company  is  simultaneously  selling  hotel  rooms  to  busy business  executives  and  marketing  a  hotel that  'remembers  your  needs,' and  is  hallmarked by the vision implicit in their slogan 'ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen.' A  travel  agent, a  corporate  travel manager, or  a  secretary, however, may  have handled  the  actual  purchase  of  the  hotel room. Thus, the Ritz-Carlton advertisements support  the  sale, but  they  do  not  actually make the sale happen.\n\n",

      "content": "S ales  is  the  critical  link  between  marketing and operations. While hospitality professionals may espouse marketing, all too often it becomes ignored in the daily hustle and bustle of  operations. It  is  the  role  of  sales  to  help bridge  this  gap  and  find  ways  for  the  key customer-contact  members  of  the  hotel  to keep the promise of marketing.\n\nSelling  starts  by  the  professional  sales managers  prospecting, making  contacts, establishing relationships with clients, uncovering  their  specific  needs  and  wants. But  it doesn't  end  there. Sales  is  also  the  host  or hostess  greeting  restaurant  patrons. Sales  is the front desk clerk welcoming a guest at the local Holiday Inn or at the Waldorf-Astoria in New  York  City. Sales  is  the  housekeeping staff  delivering  the  extra  set  of  towels  re-\n\nquested by a guest. Sales is the sommelier in a gourmet  restaurant  recommending  wines  to complement  an  entrée  choice. Sales  is  the front  office  cashier  saying, 'Thank  you  for staying  with  us. We  hope  you  enjoyed  your stay.' It  is  amazing  how  a  simple  thank-you can express appreciation for a customer's patronage and bring them back.\n\nAll client-contact personnel of a hospitality  organization  perform  personal  selling  either consciously or unconsciously. This includes  staff  who  does  not  regularly  have guest contact, such as the credit manager. One of  the  authors  nearly  lost  a  $100,000  annual account  when  a  poorly  trained  credit  manager called the client to collect a payment that had  not  yet  been  billed. A  well-trained  and motivated employee who understands how a hotel works is key to successful selling. This is accomplished through the hiring and training process, and although the many facets of human resources are beyond the scope of this chapter, its  importance  to  guest  satisfaction cannot be overstated.\n\nIn  this  particular  context, however, the hotel's human resources department can perform  services  on  behalf  of  the  sales  department  by  recruiting  sales  associates  who understand  the  nature  of  the  hotel  industry and its  place  in  the  broader  category  of  the services segment of business. Services are different from products and require specialized knowledge and training to be competitive.\n\nBecause hospitality is very much a part of the services industry, it is useful to understand how  services  differ  from  products. Those characteristics that are unique to the services industry product include perishability, simultaneity, heterogeneity, and intangibility.\n\nPerishability refers to the short shelf life of the hospitality product. If it is not sold today, the  potential  revenue  from  the  sales  of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat product is gone. A hotel room has a 24hour shelf  life. A  restaurant  seat  has  a  twohour  shelf  life. Manufactured  goods  have  a much longer period of durability. If a television  set  is  not  sold  today, it  can  be  sold  tomorrow or next week. The potential revenue from the sale of that product is not lost. But a Tuesday-night  hotel  room  cannot  be  resold on Wednesday.Tuesday has come and gone. If the hotel guest room goes unsold Tuesday, the potential revenue lost from that vacant room cannot be recouped.\n\nSimultaneity means  that  production  and consumption occur at the same time. How can you produce a guest experience without the guest? Our customers, in a sense, are part of the assembly line.They need to be present for final production of the product offering.A vacant  guest  room  produces  nothing. Yes, the carpeting  is  installed; the  bed  is  made, the bathroom plumbing works. But it all just exists until a guest arrives to use it. Simultaneous production and consumption is a unique challenge for successful operations in hospitality  management. The  guest  needs  to  be present, because  many  of  the  facets  of  the service involve performances by hotel staff.\n\nA related service characteristic in hospitality is heterogeneity. Heterogeneity refers to the variability of service delivery. Guest service agents have their moods. Customers have their moods. All have personalities of varying shapes and sizes. Hospitality is a very peopleoriented  business. Service  personnel  change from  shift  to  shift, typically  on  an  8-hour schedule. Though  operational  manuals  exist in most hospitality establishments, rarely are policies and procedures followed in an exact manner. Guests'  'personalities,' too, can change throughout their stay, and it may have nothing to do with how they were treated by service personnel. Dealing with heterogeneity\n\nin  service  operations  is  dealing  with  reality. Mistakes will happen. But more importantly, mistakes  can  be  addressed. Often  a  simple apology can win back a customer regardless of who was at fault when a mistake happens.\n\nIntangibility is a fourth major characteristic of service businesses. Some consider it the most  important  component  to  recognize. Intangibility  refers  to  the  highly  intangible  nature of the service product offering. Intangibility  is  a  feeling; it  is  having  a  sense about something that one cannot fully articulate. The intangible nature of the service product  cannot  be  prejudged. Consumers  cannot really see, touch, smell, hear, or taste a service product prior to consumption. They can only anticipate. One can test-drive a car before an automobile  purchase  is  made  to  see  what  it feels like to drive. But a hospitality customer cannot test-drive a hotel weekend package or a  restaurant  meal  prior  to  consumption. The intangibility  aspect  of  hospitality  emphasizes that service delivery is critical to customer satisfaction. Most customers have an idea of what to expect. But, in the end, they are really not sure of what they are buying until the hospitality experience actually takes place. Finally, after the service has been consumed, the guest has only the memory of the performance.\n\nThe foregoing unique characteristics represent the foundational challenge to the hotel's sales  staff: they  must  find  a  way  to promise performance and experience in such a way that the hotel's operations departments can deliver on the promise. If the essence of marketing is finding and keeping a customer, then the sales promise is fundamental to that effort. Operations' most important role is the keeping  of  that  promise  to  the  customerhaving that customer walk away with a positive and memorable experience and want to return again.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

These seemingly simple requests  add  up  to  approximately  1,000  requests every year. All of these organizations have nonprofit status and are doing valuable work in the community. They range from the symphony, opera, and ballet to large hospitals and  universities. The  smallest  of  preschools and local grassroots citizen activist organizations are also regular solicitors. Each of these organizations has a mission and purpose, that, if realized, could make the community a better  place  in  which  to  live. Because  mostly every request is valid, how does the hotel or public relations firm go about deciding which organizations to support? Each decision must be based on a benefit to the hotel.\n\nLet me give an example of how working with the community has, indeed, benefited the hotel. One  such  request  was  a  handwritten note  from  an  elementary  school  student  requesting  a  complimentary  room  for  her school raffle. We were promised in the letter that the hotel would be mentioned in the raffle  and  given  as  much  publicity  as  possible. This school was located 20 miles from the hotel in a small town that, on the surface, did not seem it could provide a lot of return benefit to the hotel. Due to the sincerity of the request, we decided to donate a room package. About four months after the donation was made, our firm  received  a  call  from  someone  who worked for a very large  company  in  Seattle wanting to make room reservations. He called me rather than the hotel because he wanted me to know he was booking the Sheraton be-\n\ncause of its donation to his child's school. Because  we  were  the  only  hotel  to  donate  a room to his child's school auction, he felt an obligation to have his guests stay at the Sheraton. Therefore, his company  was  moving from another hotel to ours because of a donation that in actuality cost about $35. The potential revenue from his account was valued in  the  thousands  of  dollars. Additionally, his company  is  a  member  of  trade  associations that  hold  numerous  regional  and  national conventions that can also influence business to the Sheraton.\n\nOther  benefits  linked  to  this  donation were  that  the  Sheraton's  name  was  seen  in print  on  more  than  1,000  raffle  tickets, and people who attended the drawing were made aware of the Sheraton's contribution. The return  on  investment  from  this  one  donation was  enormous  in  direct  revenue  alone  and also generated an excellent amount of goodwill  in  the  local  community. All  of  this  revenue  and  potential  revenue  was  due  to  one small donation!\n\n",

      "content": "T he  social  catering  business  is  fiercely  competitive. Nonprofit  organizations  are  always seeking the lowest possible rates and prices, but because of their standing in the community, they sponsor important events at hotels. The  more  prestigious  the  organization, the higher the ticket price and the more potential that  the  attendees  can  generate  revenue  for\n\nthe hotel in the future by booking rooms for other events. Most members of the boards of directors of nonprofit organizations are leaders  in  the  community  and  business  world. Their recommendation can go a long way toward securing a favorable image for the hotel in the local market.\n\nIn dealing with social catering events for nonprofit groups, we always inform organizations that the hotel staff will work closely with them  to  ensure  the  success  of  their  event. However, the  nonprofit  must  clearly  understand that the hotel is a for-profit business.We have to strike a deal that is good for the organization and, at the same time, good for the hotel. The  organization  is  helped  to  understand that the more profitable the hotel, the more  support  can  be  provided  for  the  nonprofit  organization. If the  hotel  does  not make a profit, it cannot continue to offer its support. By offering the organization special services rather than lowering the price to the point  where  the  hotel  will  not  make  any profit, we  ultimately  help  the  organization raise  even  more  money  for  their  event. We have  come  up  with  many  creative  contributions to nonprofit organizations that not only increase their potential for raising money but also  favorably  highlight  the  services  of  the hotel.\n\nOne  of  the  hotel's  most  popular  donations  to  nonprofit  organization  auctions  is  a series  of  cooking  classes  for  ten  people  that includes a kitchen tour and lunch. This item, usually set at a minimum bid of $500 to $700, enables a group of people to combine their financial resources for a potentially higher bid. The cooking classes also enable the hotel to highlight  one  of  its  chefs  and  give  people  a back-of-the-house  view  of  the  kitchen. We have  tracked  the  success  of  these  cooking classes and found that almost every one of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nparticipants  has  booked  reservations  in  the hotel restaurants. What is given away as a donation  comes  back  many  times  over  in  increased  business  and  greatly  enhances  the perception  of  the  hotel's  goodwill  in  the community.\n\nAnother innovative donation was a tour with the hotel's curator of the corporate art collection. The  Sheraton, well  known  for  its art collection, employs a professional curator. Most of the major social service organizations and nonprofit organizations show an interest in  the  arts, and  this  type  of  donation  stands out from the overnight accommodations typically offered by other hotels.\n\nThe hotel's limousine can also play a part in the donation program. The use of the limousine always adds a prestigious quality to a gift and raises more money for the organization while costing the hotel only a minimal labor and operating cost.\n\nMaking a major donation to social catering fund-raisers that are booked in the hotel helps ensure the event will be rebooked the following year (assuming the food and service are high quality).The ability to predict annual bookings provides savings in sales staff time and marketing efforts.\n\nWhen  major  social  catering  events  are held in other hotels, the Sheraton also makes significant donations to show organizations it is interested in supporting their cause no matter  where their  event  is  held. Of  course, the hotel remains interested in having the group book their event at the Sheraton next season. However, our agency always encourages the Sheraton to purchase a table when events are hosted in another hotel, for several reasons: to show support for the organization; to let the staff see how the event is managed at another facility; and to compare quality of service and food.\n\n",

Many times hotels  find  themselves  responding to people asking for money rather than actually going to the organization to tell them they are there to help them. The more creative you can be, the  easier  it  will  be  for  the  organization  to work with you. Your plan should include researching the following items:\n\nRead newspapers about the organization and  totally  familiarize  yourself  with  their goals. Make sure you meet with a major staff member and a board member. To meet with just  one  or  the  other  simply  means  you  will have to hold another meeting to review what you  discussed  at  the  last  meeting. The  most important  overall  consideration  is  to  understand the nonprofit organization's needs and to  work  together  with  their  representatives for a win-win solution.\n\nMake sure you work out before the event how the hotel will be credited and recognized. Recognition of the hotel's contribution is often assumed, forgotten, or left to chance. The hotel can be recognized in many ways.A complimentary  ad  in  a  season's  program  or\n\nnewsletter  will  go  a  long  way  in  justifying your investment. If you are trying to attract the  organization, it  must  have  an  audience that is part of your marketing mix. Calculate what it would cost to advertise in their program  book  throughout  the  season. Bargain with the organization for a complimentary ad for the amount of the donation you are making. Other possible returns for your donation include:\n\nOne of the most important aspects of any donation is the follow-up. Make sure you are aware of the news created by the organization you are helping and make them feel they are part  of your organization. If  major  events take place, have the hotel's general manager send a congratulatory letter. If someone has a birthday, have  your  pastry  chef  send  over  a birthday cake. If you can help them publicize their  events  in  your  newsletter, work  with\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthem and inform them you are giving  them complimentary  publicity.

By  hosting  the conductor and his wife in the best available room, we not only built up a good relationship with the conductor but also showed the board of directors we were very interested in supporting the symphony.\n\nBy proactively informing the board of directors  that  the  Sheraton  was  committed  to the  symphony, we, at  the  same  time, helped them  understand  our  need  for  their  board members' business so we could continue our support for them. Donating to significant cultural institutions is often a sound business decision  because  most  members  who  serve  on boards of large cultural organizations are the community's business leaders. They know the wisdom of a sound decision, and, indeed, continue to offer ongoing support to the Sheraton. As  a  result  of  the  Sheraton  donating  a room to the conductor and his wife, the symphony moved the luncheon to the hotel. The hotel maintains a strong relationship with the conductor, and  the  symphony  continues  to use  the  Sheraton  for  their  room, food, and beverage business. In  a  classic  example  of  a\n\nwin-win  situation, the  symphony  supporters, their  board  of  directors, and  their  musicians act  as  public  relations  spokespeople  for  the Sheraton. In  many  ways, the  results  of  this strategy have ensured several hundred people working on our behalf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "This section on financial control and information management was substantially reconfigured for the third edition.At the suggestion of reviewers  and  textbook  users, articles  were chosen  to  illustrate  the  relationships  among and between the activities that contribute to the  hotel's  profitability  and  operational  success through the managerial responsibility for operational  control. That  philosophy  is  continued in this fourth edition.\n\nAs  a  department, financial  management in  a  hotel-called  many  things, but  usually controller -is far more important to the success  of  that  hotel  than  the  few  readings  included  here  would  suggest. In  most  major hotel firms, the chief financial officer or controller ranks among the top two or three decision  makers  in  the  hotel's  hierarchy. The importance of this job can be established by the  observation  that  many  traditional  hotel\n\ndepartments  have  been  reorganized  so  that major portions of their functions are now responsible to the controller's office. The prime example of this is in the front office, where in the past the front office manager supervised the activities of the night audit staff, cashiers, and other front desk clerks. Increasingly, hotel firms  are  transferring  the  responsibility  for night audits and cashiers to the accounting office, with the ultimate responsibility for these information-gathering  and  controlling  functions resting with the hotel controller.\n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  an  increasingly  important  department  in  hotels  is  the one  responsible  for  the  swiftly  changing world of information management, or information technology (IT). In many instances, IT is now also the responsibility of the hotel controller. This  recognizes  the  training  and  the ability of hotel controllers to provide for the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstructured accumulation, storage, and reporting of data in forms that are most useful to the operating  departments  and  other  executives of the hotel.\n\nIn his lead article on the hotel chief financial executive, longtime contributor to this series of books  Professor  Ray  Schmidgall, Hilton Professor with the School of Hospitality Business at Michigan State University, reviews recent research on the hotel controller and compares findings over time. This review presents a good view of the job and responsibilities of this key hotel executive. Schmidgall finds  interesting  differences  in  the  groups studied  over  the  years  and  provides  a  wider window for viewing the hotel controller as a career path in management of a modern hotel operation. In  the  past, students  were  merely instructed in the process of accounting and auditing and, for the most part, were unaware of the sort of career that can result from a flair for  management, leadership, and  numbercrunching.\n\nIn Schmidgall's companion piece written with Agnes DeFranco, the critical practices of budgeting  and  forecasting  are  examined. While this is only a sampler of the critical duties  of  the  hotel's  financial  function  and  its leadership, in  today's  business  environment the  accuracy  of  forecasting  and  budgeting may indeed be the difference between profit and loss.\n\nIf  the  Schmidgall  and  DeFranco  pieces represent  the  academic  side  of  examination of  the  hotel's  financial  leadership, Mike Draeger is the chief financial executive who lives the theory on a daily basis. After a significant career with Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts  and  the  Cal-Neva  Lodge, he  now serves as the controller for a company operating a number of casinos in Nevada. Join Mike\n\nfor a look at the chief financial executive's job in his 'As I See It' essay. Pay particular attention  to  his  war  story  about  the  budgeting  process-and, yes, the  lessons  from  the embezzler.\n\nNo  discussion  of  financial  and  operational  control  in  a  hotel  would  be  complete without  attention  paid  to  the  extremely  important function of purchasing.\n\nIn the past, when the bulk of a hotel's purchasing  revolved  around  food  and  beverage items, the  executive  chef, chief  steward, and other  department  managers  usually  developed  their  own  sources  for  the  goods  and services needed to effectively and efficiently run their department. In the modern context, however, with the vast and diverse needs of hotel  operating  and  staff  departments, this practice is no longer advisable. Neither is it a good idea from a control standpoint. Most hotel companies have established a professional purchasing  function. If  purchasing  is  not  a whole department, it is the responsibility of at least one highly experienced individual.\n\nThe purchasing director or manager typically is a person who knows a great deal about departmental  operations  in  every  phase  of the hotel. He or she is able to discuss and analyze intelligently the needs of all department managers. This  individual  is  expert  in  the markets  where  hotels  purchase  goods  and products  essential  to  accomplishing  the  department and hotel missions. The purchasing director is familiar with variety, quality standards, style, and methods of packaging. Such arcane technical details as chemical composition, fabric and furnishing lifetimes, and other details too numerous to mention here are also the responsibility of the purchasing manager.\n\nLee Evans, who held corporate executive positions in purchasing with Station Casinos,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWestin Hotels and Resorts, and at the hotel level, offers  the  reader  real-world  insights into  the  duties, responsibilities, and  interactions of the hotel purchasing director. His essay  provides  rich  detail  and  examples  of how a hotel's purchasing director fulfills the purchasing  requests  of  numerous  hotel  departments. Evans is currently director of purchasing for the Oasis Resort, Casa Blanca Spa and Golf Resort, and the Virgin River Hotel and Casino in Nevada.\n\nFew people in this day and age would disagree that the management of data and information in all  its  forms  is  critical  to  business success. As recently as 1995, the year the second  edition  of  this  book  was  published, the Internet  and  World  Wide  Web  were  still pretty  much  off  the  radar  screens  of  most businesses. Well . . . now  it seems  that  the pace of technology and the means and necessity to manage huge volumes of information are  as  common as any other aspect of business  in  the  twenty-first  century. In  other words, 'What did we ever do without it?'\n\nThat's  why  I  am  hesitant  to  include  too many readings here about IT and information management-it will be old news in a couple of years, or maybe even a couple of months. I bought a new PDA last summer (2004), and it is already out of date!\n\nThe success of any hotel firm in the modern era will depend on how well it manages, controls, and  utilizes  the  available  information. This is true for current operations, but as managers  develop  new-unheard-of  nowsources of information in the lodging business environment, the information will have to be managed like any other asset or product com-\n\nponent. In the last edition of this book, I included an article about data warehousing. In the words of the author (Griffin, 1998), 'data warehousing' represents a 'central information storehouse designed to answer business questions.' This usually involves a companywide database system designed to provide information to all corporate components. In a way, information  has  become  a  commodity, and data warehouses are designed to most efficiently  manage  this  new  commodity. Well, maybe.According to the 'Data Mining. . .' article included here by Magnini and his coauthors, identifying important variables in these warehouses can be a daunting task; hence the need for data mining. Their article discusses this new development.\n\nBecause this area is so volatile and developments in IT happen so swiftly, it is probably best for the student to develop broad, general outlines of what is possible rather than, in the context of this textbook, to focus on details of current technology.As we've seen, progress in even  our  desktop  computers  has  been  so rapid  that  any  current  writing  will  probably be  outdated  by  the  time  this  book  reaches print.\n\nThe  articles  included  in  this  section  are designed to help the reader gain knowledge about  and  appreciation  for  the  range  and realm of activities, largely behind the scenes, that  contribute  to  the  financial  and  operational health of the hotel. These activities are often  overlooked  by  those  of  us  who  focus our  attention  on  the  more  public  aspects  of hotel management, but they are, nonetheless, critical to any hotel's success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Schmidgall\n\nChief  financial  executives  of  lodging  operations are given various titles including controller, chief accounting officer, vice president-accounting, and chief financial officer. The  most  common  title, at  the  property level, is controller. Who  are  these  people? What are their skills? What responsibilities do they  have? Answers  to  these  questions  and many others are provided in this chapter.\n\nThe  lodging  financial  executive  historically was viewed as a mere bookkeeper-that is, he  or  she  prepared  financial  statements. Research  shows  that  the  lodging  controller has evolved into a full-fledged member of the management team of a lodging property.\n\nConsiderable  research  has  been  conducted over the past 20 years of the membership of the Hospitality Financial and Technology  Professionals  (HFTP), formerly known  as  the  International  Association  of Hospitality  Accountants. The  results  of  this research form the basis for this chapter. The HFTP was founded in 1953 for the purpose of advancing the accounting profession. Its chief publication, The  Bottomline, is published eight times annually (bi-monthly and two special  editions). The  HFTP  currently  has  over 4,300  members  in  over  50  countries. The HFTP in 1981 established the Certified Hospitality Accountant Executive (CHAE). Since that time, more than 840 hospitality accountants have earned their CHAE. In 1994, the HFTP established the Certified Hospitality Technology  Professional  (CHTP), and  in the past six years over 100 technology professionals  have  earned  their  CHTP . These  two\n\ncertifications bring immediate recognition to these professionals in the hospitality industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Financial  executives  not  only  must know the numbers but must also lead, as they supervise several employees. The 1996 Damitio  and  Schmidgall  study  revealed  that  the number of employees supervised by these financial  executives  varied  from  one  to  more than 30. Just over one-third (34 percent) manage  two  to  five  employees, while  nearly  another  third  (31  percent)  manage  six  to  ten people.

The study of lodging financial executives covered seven keys to leadership (see Table 8.5) and 17 secrets of leadership (see Table 8.6).\n\nLodging  financial  executives  strongly agreed  that  four  of  the  seven  listed  keys  to leadership were important to their own leadership  style.

Nevertheless, 'be an expert' received a score of  4.0, indicating  that  respondents  believe that having relevant expertise is not unimportant either. Rather, the survey results indicate that these leaders believe it is more important to surround themselves with the necessary expertise than to have the expertise themselves.\n\nOf  the  17  secrets  of  leadership, respondents strongly agreed or agreed that leaders in their organizations must have 14 of them. At the top of the list were dependability, credibility, responsibility, and  accountability. At the  bottom  of  the  list  was  physical  stamina, with a score of 4.4.

The  1990  study  divides  the  responses by type of controller. The vast majority (over  75  percent)  of  lodging  financial executives have authority to sign checks, approve purchases, and extend credit.Tse found that  only  56  percent  of  hospitality  financial executives  have  authority  to  approve  purchase  decisions. Damitio  and  Schmidgall  re-\n\nported  56  percent  were  authorized  to  make purchasing decisions without the approval of others. They indicated controllers were most involved with technology purchases (90 percent) and, to lesser degrees, guest supplies (29 percent), furnishings and equipment (44 percent), security/maintenance systems (43 percent), and  fire/safety/energy  conservation systems (30 percent).\n\nThe expansion of authority based on the two Geller studies is the greatest for investing funds (from 2 percent to 46 percent) and to set  or  change  prices  (from  21  percent  to  41 percent).\n\nBoth  the  Tse  and  the  Damitio  and Schmidgall studies  covered  hiring  and  firing authority. Tse  found  that  more  than  80  percent of the respondents have the authority to hire and fire either in their own department or in their company.The percentage increased to 90 percent when only accounting personnel were  involved. The  1996  study  by  Damitio and Schmidgall revealed 76 percent have authority to hire and fire within their own department, while 7 percent have no authority to hire or fire.\n\nOnly  the  two  Geller  studies  (1984  and 1990) covered responsibility, and the comparative results are shown in Table 8.8.Again, the 1990  study  provided  detail  by  type  of  controller and included areas not covered by the 1984 study.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the respondents indicated  they  have  responsibility  for  such standard accounting functions as general accounting, receivables, and  payables. Other major areas of responsibility shared by most controllers (75 percent or more) include payroll, night and income audits, computers in accounting, and cash management.\n\nThere are indications that controllers are becoming increasingly involved with the op-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 8.7 Extent of Authority over Specific FunctionsTable 8.8 Controllers' Responsibilities\n\nresponsibilities. Fifty-two percent of the respondents in 1984 had some responsibility for EDP .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nerational aspects of their hotels. More than 50 percent  of  the  respondents  indicated  that their responsibilities included purchasing, receiving, food and beverage controls, and storage (inventory). The number of respondents responsible for the storage function increased 18 percentage points from 1984 to 1990, from 34  percent  to  more  than  52  percent, and  a purchasing  function  was  claimed  by  60  percent of the respondents in 1990, which is 10 points greater than in 1984. Responsibility for hotel  security, the  least  commonly  shared function  among  the  controllers, more  than doubled in the last six years, growing from 9 percent  in  1984  to  almost  22  percent  in  the 1990 study.\n\nThe  controllers'  role  in  electronic  data processing (EDP) and computer system management grew by leaps and bounds during the 1980s. In 1990, 88 percent of the respondents indicated responsibility for the computer systems used for accounting functions.\n\nAdditionally, 58  percent  indicated  responsibility  for  front  office  and  reservations system computers-systems clearly not under the  umbrella  of  traditional  accounting  functions. In  the  1984  study, respondents  were asked just  one  question  about  responsibility for EDP, and 52 percent of the controllers indicated that they had some responsibility for EDP. It's clear that, over the years, computeroriented responsibilities have escalated\n\nsharply. This  trend  can  be  expected  to  continue into the twenty-first century.\n\n",

      "content": "Raymond S. Schmidgall and Agnes L. DeFranco\n\nFinancial forecasts and budgets can strengthen management's control of hotel operating  expenses  and  help  determine  the profitability  of  the  property  (Chamberlain, 1991, 89-90; DeMyer and Wang-Kline, 1990, 64; and Karch, 1992, 21-22). Specifically, forecasts  give  owners  a  projected  level  of  sales, while  budgets  alert  owners  and  operators alike  to  significant  expenditures  that  are  on the  horizon  or  predictable  shortfalls  in  revenues. Used  together, forecasts  and  budgets can provide a benchmark for sales-incentive\n\nprograms, executive-compensation  bonuses, incentive-based management fees, and capital expenditures (Temling and Quek, 1993).\n\nA  major  difference  between  forecasting and  budgeting  is  that  budgeting  is  normally viewed as a process that covers a longer period of time than forecasting. Budgeting often results in a formal, long-range plan, normally expressed in terms of dollars over time-for example, the  predicted  revenues  and  expenses of a hotel for 24 months (Schmidgall, 1997, 369-372, 411-413). On the other hand,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nforecasts are generally prepared by hoteliers to  establish  staffing  levels  and  may  cover  a period of just seven to ten days (Schmidgall, 1989, 101-2, 104-5). Long-range  budgeting, therefore, is  a  form  of  strategic  planning. It may entail several years' financial projections, a  coordinated  management  policy, and  a control-and-correction  mechanism  that  allows  actual  results  to  be  compared  to  estimates  and  followed  by  corrective  steps, if necessary (Coltman, 1994).\n\n",

      "content": "Limitation. Our  study  used  a  randomsampling technique to select 600 samples that yielded  171  responses  (almost  30  percent  of the sample).As a result, there may be respondents who belong to the same national chain and thus represent the same set of corporate operating  procedures. In  addition, with  the full-service and luxury segments of the hotel industry constituting more than 90 percent of our responses, the results are likely more applicable to those two groups than to limitedservice  hotels. Thus, although  more  than one-quarter of the hotel executives solicited by this study responded, it may not be useful to generalize the study's results (particularly beyond full-service hotels).\n\nThe instrument. We designed a four-part questionnaire with the assistance of a number of lodging controllers and by modifying a survey  previously  used  in  1995  (Borchgrevink and Schmidgall, 1995).We also employed a pilot  study  in  which  other  lodging  controllers offered comments and allowed us to fine-tune the final survey. Part I of the questionnaire included  six  questions  that  collected  demographic data about the respondents and their lodging operations. Parts II and III consisted of 14 questions regarding the procedures and methods  used  to  develop  an  operations budget, and about how the budget is used for financial  control. Finally, the  last  part  of  the questionnaire  asked  respondents  to  provide information regarding their various operating departments' forecasting techniques.\n\nSampling. As mentioned,a simple randomsampling  technique  was  used  to  select  our study's population. Six hundred financial executives who are associated with lodging operations were chosen from the 1997 membership list of the association of Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals (formerly  the  International  Association  of Hospitality Accountants).\n\nData collection and analysis. We first sent the survey in October 1997 to each of the 600 executives, requesting them to participate in our study. To ensure a good response rate, we sent a second copy of the survey to everyone in January 1998, as a reminder. Data received were  analyzed  using  the  software  package SPSS for Windows.\n\n",

Moreover, almost  60  percent  indicated  that they set a tentative financial goal prior to developing the operations budget. The majority of those (64 percent) related that tentative financial goals were based on either sales (33 percent)  or  net-income  (31  percent)  levels. (In this case, sales equals revenues, while net income refers to the financial statement's bottom  line.)  Other  financial  executives'  financial goals  were  based  on  gross  operating profit, net  operating  profit, EBITDA, debtservice coverage, occupancy percentage, RevPAR, or some combinations of those.\n\nWe presented  five  possible  reasons  why an operations budget might be prepared, and we  also  offered  the  fill-in-the-blank  answer 'other.'When asked to give one major reason why  a  budget  was  prepared, 45  percent  selected the option that stated 'It is used as a standard  by  which  the  lodging  operation  is\n\nFigure 8.2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanaged.' Another 28 percent chose the answer 'It is a planning tool.' About 15 percent of the respondents gave more than one reason, and their responses almost always noted a budget's value as a standard of comparison or as a planning tool.\n\nMore than 90 percent of the respondents reported that a co-operative effort among hotel departments was used to prepare the operations  budget. Nevertheless, 73  percent reported that the controller was the one who held the main responsibility for preparing the operations  budget  using  the  input  provided by  other  department  heads  and  the  general manager.\n\nOnly five respondents indicated that the controller prepares the budget with little input  from  others. Thus, in  more  than  threequarters of the hotels surveyed, the controller was  primarily  in  charge  of  budget  preparation. In another 5 percent, the lodging units' controllers and general managers jointly prepared it, and in 12 percent of the hotels, the general  manager  coordinated  the  budgetpreparation process with the various department  heads. Other  responses  indicated  that budget-preparation  responsibility  fell  to  an\n\nexecutive  committee, department  heads, the general manager (with input from the owner), or a budget team (for example, a team might comprise  the  general  manager, owner, and controller).\n\nWhile all but three of our 171 respondents confirmed  that  they  prepared  an  operations budget for the year, less than half prepared a long-range budget (i.e., for more than a year at a  time). Of  those  who  prepared  long-range budgets, more than three-quarters used a fiveyear time span for future planning.\n\nMaking adjustments. Only one in four of the  respondents  revised  their  budget  at  any point during the operating year, with the most common frequency of change being monthly (40 percent). Other responses to this question included  'as  needed' (21  percent), 'quarterly' (16  percent), 'semiannually' (12  percent), 'bimonthly' (3  percent), and  some combination of the above (4 percent).\n\n",

Next, we asked what level of  variance  between  the  budget  (original  or revised) and actual performance is permitted before corrective action is taken. The results for  this  question  are  summarized  in  Table 8.10. About a third of the respondents try to hold  food, beverage, and  labor  costs  within the  range  of  1  to  2  percent  of  the  budgeted amounts. One-fifth  of  the  respondents  hold 'other' budget items within a range of 2 to 3 percent.

      "content": "A ccurate budgets are considered essential to profitable hotel operation.Yet obtaining  reliable  data  is  a  problem. Smith  and Lesure state that perhaps the greatest problem  with  forecasting  and  budgeting  is  the number of widely varying forecasts that are regularly  published  side  by  side, without question or support, and in some cases making  all  predictions  vague. 1 Moreover, business  prejections  and  financial  trends  are often published without any explanation of the underlying  assumptions. Smith  and Lesure contend that perhaps the way to construct  reliable  forecasts  and  budgets  is  to build  a  statistically  reliable  industrywide database that can be regularly updated with and compared to new economic and financial information.Those numbers can then be used to develop a short-term outlook for the industry  as  a  whole  or  various  geographic and market segments.\n\nHoteliers' desire and need for accurate budgeting and reliable data are not new. In 1989, hoteliers reported being generally satisfied with their forecasting accuracy, and yet they  desired  improvement. 2 Just  one  year\n\nearlier, Lasky noted that budgeting was one of the factors hoteliers ignored when opening a hotel.Thus, he wrote, he was personally involved in  rescuing  130  hotels  and  motels from bankruptcy due to this oversight. 3\n\nBesides the budget's role as the business plan for owners and operators, Temling and Quek  discuss  the  importance  of  hotels' budgets to lenders. 4 The budget is important to  this  group, as  it  can  indicate  a  lodging company's potential for success. It also lets the  officers  of  financial  institutions  know about the financial health of the business.\n\nAs  the  lodging  industry's  competitiveness increases, so does the interest in budgeting  practices, as  indicated  by  studies  that appear  biennially, on  average. In  1995, 122 U.S. lodging  properties  were  asked  about their  budgeting  practices. 5 The areas of investigation  included: budget  development processes, budget  reforecasting  procedures, and budgetary control methods.\n\nTo  further  investigate  the  budgeting process, 140  U.S. lodging  controllers  were asked in 1997 about their use of forecasting and  budgeting  at  the  department  level. 6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThat  study  reported  that  controllers  rated 'proper  staffing' as  the  main  benefit  of preparing forecasts and 'strategic planning' as  the  main  benefit  of  budgeting. That study's results also showed that a hotel's size (as measured by the number of rooms) did not significantly influence the perception of the usefulness or the practices of forecasting and budgeting.\n\nSome years earlier, Records and Glennie provided insights to the Boca Raton Resort  and  Club's  budgeting  and  business forecasting processes. 7 Forecasting business volume and scheduling the required labor to serve its customer are crucial steps in maintaining an operation's quality. Thus, using a relatively simple computer network and basic  software, the  Boca  Raton  Resort  and Club ensured it could control budgets, forecasts, and labor schedules.\n\n1 R.A. Smith and J. D.

      "content": "T o see whether a property's (1) affiliation, (2) size  in  terms  of  sales, and  (3)  profitability have any effect on its budgeting practices, we used  the  chi-square  statistic. The  properties' budgeting practices were reflected in the answers to eight questions that asked about the procedures and methods used to develop operations  budgets  and  how  those  operations budgets were used in budgetary control.\n\nWe first classified the responses according to the properties' affiliation.A chi-square was then calculated by cross-tabulating the affilia-\n\ntion on one hand and the eight questions on the other. Next, the same procedure was used to  classify  the  responses  according  to  sales level, and then by profitability. If an effect has a probability value (p-value) or a significance level  of  less  than  0.05, it  is  significant. That means, in general, the effect happens due to chance less than 5 percent of the time.As seen in  Table  8.12, two  of  the  practices  were  affected  by  property  affiliation, one  was  affected  by  sales, and  one  was  affected  by profitability  (see  those  data  marked with an asterisk).\n\nWhen the chi-square test was performed based on annual sales, a significant difference (p < 0.05)  was  found  in  the  preparation  of long-range  operating  budgets  (Table  8.13). That is, the higher the sales level a property enjoyed, the  greater  the  likelihood  that  the property  prepared  a  long-range  operations budget.\n\nOur second set of cross-tabulations determined  whether  differences  occur  between\n\nTable 8.12 Property Characteristics Correlated with Budgetary Practices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 8.13 The Effect of Annual Sales on Long-Range Planning\n\nbranded lodging operations and independent properties (Table 8.12). We noted two statistical  differences, namely (1) the major reason for  having  an  operations  budget  and  (2) whether a tentative financial goal was set in advance.\n\nFirst, it appears that national-chain hotels cited  different  reasons  for  having  an  operations budget than did the independent properties, as shown in Table 8.14.\n\nHoteliers  affiliated  with  national  chains tend  to  have  more  than  a  single  reason  for\n\ncreating an operations budget. In addition, it appears  that  national  chains  prepare  the budget  to  be  used  for  comparison  purposes more  often  than  do  the  independents, and that the independents prefer to use the operating budget as a planning tool (compared to the national chains).\n\nSecond, 65 percent of the chain properties responding  to  our  questionnaire  established tentative  financial  goals  prior  to  developing their operations budgets compared to only 45 percent  of  the  independent  properties. This difference is most likely due to pressure from chains' corporate offices on individual properties to deliver the required 'profit' to meet the chains' overall financial objective.\n\nThe last step of our research was to test for differences according to profitability. The profitability  of  each  respondent  was  determined by dividing the net income reported by each  hotel  by  its  total  sales. Respondents were  then  divided  into  four  categories  according to their profitability: less than 11 percent, 11 to 20 percent, 21 to 30 percent, and over 30 percent (Table 8.15). The greater the respondent's  profit  margin, the  more  likely that  a  single  reason  was  cited  for  having  an operations budget.\n\nTable 8.14 The Effect of Affiliation on Budget Usefulness\n\nNote: Totals may not add to 100 due to rounding.\n\nFigures in US dollars (millions).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 8.15 The Effect of Profit Margin on Budget Usefulness\n\nNote: Totals may not add to 100 due to rounding.\n\n",

      "content": "O perations budgeting is an important part of U.S. hotels' financial planning.The majority of hoteliers set tentative financial goals prior to preparing their operations budgets. The goal for the majority of hoteliers is based on either sales or net income. Most hoteliers indicated that the major reason they used budgets at all was  as  a  standard  for  comparison  to  actual performance  figures. The  second  most  common use was as a planning tool.At the majority of  hotels, a  cooperative  effort  among departments was used to produce the budget. In a clear majority of those hotels, the financial executives coordinated this process. Less than  half  of  all  respondents  prepared  longterm operations budgets, and less than a quarter  of  all  respondents  indicated  that  their budgets were revised during the year.\n\nAll but two of the 171 respondents indicated that their operations budgets were used for control purposes. For all departments, the mean of the allowable deviation between the\n\nbudget and actual performance ranged near 2 to 3 percent. That range is slightly tighter and smaller than the range measured in a similar study in 1996 (Schmidgall, Borchgrevink, and Zahl-Begnum).\n\nRespondents'  revenue-forecasting  techniques  varied  by  department  within  individual hotels. A number of respondents reported they used multiple techniques for a single department. The  most  commonly  used  technique  was 'expected  units  sold  by  expected average price per unit.' Other techniques that were used by more than 20 percent of the respondents included 'number of guests by expected  spending  per  guest' and 'last  year's actual revenues adjusted subjectively.'\n\nOur  research  uncovered  several  points that deserve attention. First, virtually all hotels  use  an  operations  budget  and  yet  less than  half  of  the  hotels  budget  beyond  one year at a time. Future researchers might explore  the  reasons  why  more  hoteliers  don't prepare  long-range  operations  budgets. Second, few hoteliers revise their budget during the year (only about one in four). Budgeting is not an exact science, so regular adjustments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshould  be  expected  and  planned. Third, for most hotels, the largest single cost is labor.Yet our research shows that hotels' food and beverage  costs  appear  to  be  more  closely  controlled than are labor costs.\n\nFuture research could also focus on specific  control  techniques  to  monitor  hotels' costs and to determine whether moreprofitable  hotels  use  different  techniques\n\nthan  less-profitable  hotels. Finally, further study  could  examine  closely  the  forecasting techniques actually used by the operating departments. For  example, in our  study, the technique  'last  year's  actual  revenues  adjusted subjectively' was rated high, and future research could explore exactly what 'subjective' adjustments are being used.\n\n",

      "title": "8.4 AS I SEE IT: THE HOTEL CONTROLLER",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Mike Draeger\n\nThe controller is the manager with overall responsibility  of  the  accounting  department. This executive is credited with having his or her hand on the purse strings, eye on the bottom line, and ear of the general manager, all while  counting  the  beans  and  balancing  the books. In  fulfilling  this  role, the  controller must know the hotel operations and be familiar with what goes on in each department. As is  the  same  with  all  other  managerial  roles, the controller must have many skills that are used daily.\n\nObviously, the controller is an administrator. He or she supervises the accounting functions, including payroll, payables, receivables, purchasing, and auditing.The controller wants to  know that procedures are being followed and deadlines are being met. He or she questions what is happening in each hotel department. Is  all  the  money  getting  to  the  bank, and is there enough to pay all the vendors and staff? That  large  group  function  in  the  ballroom  is  being  extended  30-day  credit; have their references been checked? Are purchase orders  on  file  in  the  receiving  department?\n\nDo the actual payroll tax deposits equal what is reported on the IRS form? Accounting affects almost every aspect of the hotel operation, and the controller is the one looked to when it comes to the proper functioning and conduct of this department.\n\nThe controller is  an  advisor, meaning  he or  she  provides  information  and  recommendations  to  every  department  in  the  hotel. Regarding  giving  information, accounting generates more reports than any other department. Daily reports to management showing sales, labor, and purchases are a must in any business, with  comparisons  to  budget  and/or last year. The financial statements, including  the  balance  sheet  and  income  statement,are periodically produced in accounting. The controller is expected to be prepared to discuss these types of reports with managers and owners, and to make sense of all the numbers and percentages. A hotel holds any number of meetings where the controller discusses the  financial  or  operational  results. At  these meetings, the controller is a part of the process of  generating  recommendations  and  sugges-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntions  to  improve  operations  in  areas  the  reports might point out. Often, a morning operations meeting finds the controller addressing labor costs that are creeping higher than appropriate given current levels of business, or the monthly manager's meeting starts with the controller giving an overview of last month's financial  results  and  the  hotel's  year-to-date standing.When the owners visit the hotel, they usually  attend  a  meeting  to  discuss  financial results and what is being done to ensure profitability expectations are being met. The controller  might  even  be  asked  to  sit  in  on  a specific  department's  staff  meeting  as  its members brainstorm ways to reduce departmental costs. As others digest the information accounting provides, the controller offers advice and counsel on its significance.\n\nThe controller is also a technician. He or she must have a foundation in the debits and credits  of  accounting. Regardless  of  whether the accounting department is staffed with one person or two dozen, the controller is prepared to jump in and do the work.A tight labor market  and  staff  turnover  sometimes  necessitate that  the  controller  assist  in  every  function. There  are  always  balance  sheet  accounts  to reconcile, budget  variances  to  explain, and journal entries to post. It takes a lot to keep an accounting department functioning.\n\nVery early in my accounting career, I began working in a small accounting department of  a  regional  restaurant  chain. Due  to  state laws, the restaurants could buy alcoholic beverages with cash or check only, and never on credit. To facilitate purchasing, the restaurant general  manager  was  provided  an  imprest checking account for purchasing alcohol. (An imprest  account  is  one  that  has  a  specific amount of money in it, and money replaced with precise amounts checks are written for.) This account had $1,000 in it, and each week\n\nthe manager called the home office and have deposited into the account the amount equal to  the  checks  written  in  the  previous  week. Then  the  invoices  for  what  had  been  purchased  were  forwarded  to  the  home  office, which supported the amount of the transfer. In theory, the account balance never exceeded $1,000. The bank statements were sent to the general manager of the restaurant to balance and send completed to the home office.\n\nBecause I  was  the  new  guy, I  was  given the task of balancing the checking account of one restaurant, which had not been balanced in over two years. It was well known that this restaurant's  manager, an  exceptional  people person, wasn't good with numbers and never found time to balance that puny checking account. So  I  went  to  work  ticking  off  the checks  and  deposits  and  trying  to  make  the account balance to the $1,000 imprest amount. There  were  several  irregularities, and, of  course, many  documents  (cashed checks) were missing. I worked with the bank to recreate copies and research the irregularities, of which there were many. When all was finished, I  had  discovered  the  manager  had embezzled  over  $18,000!  This  manager  had actually  been  a  very  astute  numbers  person and had found ways to divert extra funds into the account and then wrote checks to himself and others for personal use.\n\nIt  was a technician who caught him. But had  a  technician  balanced  that  checkbook monthly  and  always  verified  the  purchases through the invoices, it never would have happened  in  the  first  place. Procedures  were wrong and not enforced, and the climate was ripe  for  trouble. A  good  bookkeeper  or  accountant is primarily a good technician in accounting aspects, and a good controller does not lose sight of this ability as his or her career develops.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMost successful businesses create a financial  plan  or  budget  to  operate  by. The  more honest and detailed this plan is, the better one can gauge actual performance. Most budgets are  prepared  annually, with  monthly  detail breakdowns.The controller is a planner and is usually the one who prepares the budget-or, better  yet, coordinates  the  hotel's  efforts  in preparing  departmental  budgets  to  consolidate into one master document. I worked for a  company  that  provided  major  cash  incentives  for  meeting  and  exceeding  the  annual budgeted  bottom-line  numbers. Budgeting was taken very seriously, and each member of management had a vested interest in all departments'  performance. Budgeting  is  not hard to do, but it can be time-consuming.\n\nOver the years, I became a detail-oriented and  effective  budgeter, although  my  first budget review taught me the most. My hotel and I had spent weeks and months preparing the next year's budget. All the numbers had been gone over, comparisons completed, and volumes of expense and revenue backup catalogued and bound in three-ring binders. The general manager and I flew 3,000 miles, with our binders, to present the budget to our area and regional vice presidents and receive the company's stamp of approval.We were scheduled  for  a  five-hour  review  session, if  that much  time  was  needed. As  the  GM  and  I came  into  the  review  room, the  vice  presidents were already seated and waiting. They stated that this could be a short and productive meeting. If we would only commit to increasing  our  bottom  line  by  $200,000, we could all be out of there in five minutes. No way!  The  GM  and  I  had  solid  defendable numbers, and we weren't going to let months of  everyone's  hard  honest  work  get  blown away. Needless  to  say, the  review  lasted  the entire  five  hours, our  budget  was  ripped  to\n\nshreds, and  the  GM  and  I  were  verbally bloodied, bruised, and beaten at the end of it all. Oh  yes, our bottom line increased $350,000, and we did not make budget or our bonuses that year.A good manager should always  know  what  the  people  above  him  are looking for and then strive or rather plan to produce it, and this includes budgeting.\n\nAdditionally, the  controller  is  an  educator. All managers have a responsibility to instruct  and  train  others, and  the  controller  is no exception. Obviously, the accounting staff must be proficient in their duties to perform their jobs, and the controller must ensure this is happening. However, to the majority of the hotel, what accounting does and how they do it  can be quite a mystery. Controllers should demystify  the  role  of  accounting. Managers with an understanding of accounting find they have more tools to work with in the operation of their departments after they have been involved in just one year's budget process. The controller can be building public relations for accounting by using opportunities to develop others' financial awareness and expertise.\n\nFinally, controllers  should  be  mentors. They should be involved in the development of people. The accounting staff should experience new challenges to keep them interested. Cross-training in other accounting or hotel positions can give staff perspective on areas not previously understood.This aids staff in developing  their  careers  and  additionally  helps within the department when staff is short.\n\nThere was a time when this backfired on me, though. My accounting department had a staff of 14, and each was cross-trained to perform at least part of a job besides their own. My general cashier was responsible for counting the previous day's receipts and preparing the  bank  deposit. Additionally, she  replenished the cash banks used in the restaurants\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand stores and at the front desk. She was responsible for maintaining a safe in her office that contained close to $400,000. Sadly, her father  passed  away  and  she  needed  to  leave town for a week or so. No problem! We had someone  in  accounts  receivable  that  had cross-trained  in  the  cashiering  position  and was able to step in immediately. The cashiering temp completed her first week without a hitch.We left work for the weekend feeling all was  well. On  Monday, my  cashiering  temp didn't show up for work. She also didn't call. In fact, I have never seen her since. Over the weekend, she had taken advantage of procedural flaws and helped herself to $30,000 of the hotel's money and fled.\n\nWhen I was able to step back and take a broad look at what had happened, I realized the  problem. The  accounting  procedures were such that one person could steal from the safe and not be questioned. Not only was this an opportunity for a dishonest employee, but it placed an honest employee in danger! One employee had both the combination and the  key  to  the  safe  tumbler. One  employee could go into the accounting offices alone on a  day  when  the  entire  hotel  knew  the  accounting  department  was  closed. One  employee could go into the cashier's office alone with a backpack and exit the office, department, and the building without anyone asking  to  see  inside  the  backpack. A  single employee could be in physical danger if others  knew  all  of  this  and  were  hard  up  for cash. Needless  to say, procedures  were changed  immediately  and  policy  manuals were rewritten with haste.\n\nThe controller should be on the lookout for promising managers who show potential. Managers  enjoy  taking  a  few  minutes  over coffee or lunch or even just sitting in the office  to  talk  about  their  objectives  and  goals.\n\nOften the controller can facilitate a manager's accomplishments by being a friend and being aware of the manager's professional developmental needs.\n\nMentoring and educating can benefit the controller in many ways-maybe, most interestingly, his or  her  personal  advancement and  compensation. Several  hotel  companies evaluate  and  offer  incentives  to  the  backof-the-house  departments  for  criteria  previously  reserved  for  more  service-oriented  or revenue-producing  departments. As  a  controller  of  an  accounting  department, I  am measured by the service my department provides  to  the  hotel  operation-our  internal customers.Accounting becomes a support department  and  the  rest  of  the  operation  its customers. In  this  way, accounting  offers products and services, and it works to satisfy customers.The manager and even staff can establish quantifiable objectives focused on the department's product. These become the criteria  for  performance  evaluations, bonuses, and other incentives and rewards.\n\nCurrent  objectives  in  accounting  might now include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith this type of product and service attitude, there is no limit to what a department might do for its customers.\n\nIt is not easy to describe the controller's job as a daily routine. However, the position does call for skills and traits that are continually in use. Just as with all other aspects of the\n\nhotel, the  scenery  is  always  changing, guests are constantly arriving and departing, restaurants open and close, telephones ring 24 hours a day. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities, and the controller, as part of this, must embrace the many facets of the hospitality industry.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "C. Lee Evans\n\nThe hotel purchasing function did not change very much from 1970 to 1990. Until the late 1980s, various  tax  advantages  and  benefits were the primary reason for the construction of  U.S. hotels. Providing a substantial return on investment was not expected or required.\n\nIn  our  current  economy, expectations  of hotel profitability have changed. Profitability is  now  required, along  with  maintaining  the established level of quality. This has brought about a new level of interest in the purchasing function  and  greater  importance  placed  on cost savings.\n\nThe financial aspects of the hotel business changed  in  the  1990s. Hotels  enjoyed  the longest  boom  in  revenues  and  profitability over the previous 40 years.\n\nToday, however, in  the  slump  following the terrorist attacks of 2001, hotel managers realize that true cost savings generated in the purchasing department are dollars that drop directly to the bottom line without associated incremental cost. It is not difficult to generate arbitrary  savings; the  true  challenge  is  to create  cost  efficiency  utilizing  a  standard specification.\n\nPurchasing  for  the  hotel  requires  much more  than  obtaining  three  bids  and  circling\n\nthe  lowest  price. The  true  definition  of purchasing should be 'purchasing the right product, at the right price, at the right time.'\n\nThe  statement  sounds  extremely  simple, but  when  it  is  applied  to  the  thousands  of items  a  hotel  purchases, it  presents  a  great challenge  for  the  purchasing  manager. The hotel  purchasing  function  supports  virtually every department within the property, whether purchasing chemicals for housekeeping or stewarding, office supplies for marketing, computer supplies for accounting, or food and  beverage  products  for  the  restaurant outlets.\n\nThe  purchasing  manager  usually  reports to the hotel controller or the hotel's financial control division, but I am convinced this will change. There  is  a  need  for  a  more  operational  approach to managing the purchasing function.We need to build a team that is committed  to  the  common  goal  of  servicing  our customers and maintaining established quality standards. The reporting structure will begin to shift to operations, with the purchasing manager  directly  reporting  to  the  general manager or, in larger properties, to the executive  assistant/operations  manager. This  will help promote the philosophy of team building\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  support  and  service  customers  directly. As matters stand now, purchasing is viewed as a support department.\n\nWith  the  increasing  importance  of  the purchasing  function, the  mission  of  the  purchasing  manager is  to  procure  products  and services cost-effectively that will meet or exceed the customer's expectation.The purchasing manager must continually evaluate product  specifications  to  incorporate  new products and technology. Reviewing the specific need based on the expectation of the customer helps product evaluation.\n\nThe  purchasing  function  is  changing  for several reasons. In the past five to seven years, the hotel industry has undergone tremendous consolidation. With  this  consolidation  have come  economies  of  scale  for  support  areas, which  include  marketing, accounting, purchasing, and reservation systems. Many of today's  hotel  companies  have  centralized  the purchasing function to some extent. They negotiate  purchasing  agreements  with  producers  and  processors  and  distribute  products and supplies through predetermined distribution channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Hodge\n\nIn the hotel industry, knowing your guestswhere they are from, how much they spend, and  when  and  on  what  they  spend  it-can help you formulate marketing strategies and maximize profits. Fueled by the proliferation of centralized  reservation  and  propertymanagement systems, hotel  corporations  accumulate  large  amounts  of  consumer  data. This information can be organized and integrated in databases that can then be tapped to guide marketing decisions. However, identifying important variables and relationships located in these consumer-information systems can  be  a  daunting  task. The  relatively  new process known as data mining can be instrumental in  overcoming  such  obstacles. [For  a discussion  of  the  use  of  compiled  data, see Robert  K. Griffin, 'Data  Warehousing: The Latest Strategic Weapon for the Lodging Industry?' Cornell  Hotel  and  Restaurant  Administration Quarterly 39, no. 4 (August 1998), pp. 28-35. For a discussion of the use of guest-\n\nhistory data, see Paula A. Francese and Leo M.Renaghan,'Database Marketing: Building Customer Profiles.' Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly 31, no. 1 (May 1990), pp. 60-63.] From stores of information, data  mining  technology  extracts  meaningful patterns  and  builds  predictive  customerbehavior models that aid in decision making (Kamrani, Rong, and Gonzalez, 2001, 361-377).\n\nData  mining  is  a largely automated process  that  uses  statistical  analyses  to  sift through  massive  data  sets  to  detect  useful, non-obvious, and  previously  unknown  patterns  or  data  trends  (Frawley, PiatetskyShapiro, and  Matheus, 1992, 213-228). The emphasis  is  on  the  computer-based  exploration  of  previously  uncharted  relationships (i.e., using 'machine  learning' methods  that typically require only limited human involvement) (Peacock, 1998a).Without data mining, valuable marketing insights about customers'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncharacteristics and purchase patterns may remain largely untapped (Shaw, Subramaniam, Tan, and Welge, 2001, 127-137). By uncovering  such  previously  unknown  relationships, managers have the potential to develop a winning  marketing  strategy  that  increases  their hotel's bottom line.\n\nHotel  managers  understand  the  importance of adapting to the changing business environment  not  only  to  remain  competitive, but merely to survive. As a result, technology has become a large and growing expense for many hotel corporations. Under such a technology framework, data mining is a valuable competitive tool being adopted by hotel corporations  in  an  effort  to  create  customer value. However, given  the  importance  and complexity of data mining, senior hotel managers  report  a  low  level  of  understanding about data mining's capabilities, how it works, and  what  value  this  technology  contributes (Dev and Olsen, 2000, 41-47). The purpose of this paper is to educate hotel managers about the benefits and application of data mining on the properties they oversee.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "D ata mining differs from traditional statistical modeling in a variety of ways. Data mining focuses  on  machine-driven  model  building, while  statistical  modeling  stresses  theorydriven hypothesis testing. Data mining techniques build models, whereas classical statistical tools are supervised by a trained researcher  who  possesses  a  preconceived  notion  of  what  to  examine. With  statistical a priori analysis, relevant  associations  may  be overlooked. By  building  dependency  hy-\n\npotheses  instead  of  merely  verifying  them, though, data mining techniques reveal important  links. For  example, Marriott  Vacation Club International reduced the volume of direct mail it needed to reach target sales levels by correlating response rates to specific vacation  offerings  and  specific  customer  characteristics (Peacock, 1998a).\n\nData  mining  also  offers  enormous  gains in  terms  of  performance, speed  of  use, and user friendliness (Le Bret, 1997). While data miners must understand statistical principles, highly specialized statistical knowledge is not necessary to study, understand, and improve decision-making processes. Data mining helps managers to spot trends more quickly.\n\nBecause  researchers  may  ignore  the  assumptions  and  limitations  of  a  theoretical model, traditional statistical analyses in customer-satisfaction  research  are  often  biased. Satisfaction research includes measures of  the  importance  that  customers  place  on product  and  services  attributes. Typically, these  measures  are  highly  correlated, which can  dramatically  bias  the  statistical  values that  determine  attributes'  importance  rankings. Also, statistical analyses usually assume that  relationships  between  independent  and dependent variables are linear-which is often not the case. Therefore, violation of these assumptions can result in biased and misleading  statistical  outcomes. Data  mining  techniques (e.g., neural networks) overcome these limitations and outperform traditional statistical  analyses  in  cases  where  such  assumptions do not apply (Le Bret, 1997).\n\nAnother considerable advantage over traditional statistical models is data mining's ability to easily handle large and complex datasets (Peacock, 1998a). Data mining techniques are not hampered by large numbers of predictive variables, and that feature makes data mining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

The point remains, though, that in comparison with traditional statistical methods, data mining  techniques  invariably  are  more  data driven than they are user driven.\n\nWe have observed that some hotel corporations  are  attempting  to  harness  the  power of  information  by  investing  in  data  mining technology  that  exploits  consumer  information. Hilton Corporation uses E.piphany E.4 software at its Beverly Hills headquarters, for instance  (Stevens, 2001a, 35-38), and  Starwood Corporation recently invested in Unica Corp's  Affinium  software  (Tischelle  and Maselli, 2001, 31-32). Such data mining technology  allows  hotel  corporations  to  predict consumer-behavior  trends, which  are  potentially  useful  for  marketing  applications. For example, Starwood's marketing staff can run reports  and  analysis  on  customer  and  occupancy  data  stored  in  a  data  warehouse  that combines customer and transaction information from all company properties. Such infor-\n\nmation indicates where customers who visit a specific hotel live. If the data reveal that the Sheraton Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco experiences  a  surge  in  visitors  from  Fort Lauderdale in April, for instance, hotel marketers  can  increase  promotional  efforts  in Fort Lauderdale  during  the late winter months (Tischelle and Maselli, 2001, 31-32).

      "level": 2,
      "content": "I n  1997  Harrah's  hotels  and  casinos  introduced  a  trademarked  loyalty-card  program, 'Total  Rewards,' which  tracks  customers' purchasing  activities  and  provides  rewards that encourage spending at Harrah's properties. Rather than build glitzy properties with eye-popping attractions, Harrah's pursued a customer-service-oriented  strategy  centered around  data  mining  techniques. Harrah's used an information system called WINet to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlink  all  its  properties, allowing  the  firm  to collect and share customer  information company wide. The process effectively changed the corporate culture from an everyproperty-for-itself  mentality  to  a  collaborative, customer-focused enterprise (Levinson, 2001).\n\nThe WINet system connects and consolidates  customer  information  from  all  of  the company's  transaction, slot-machine, hotelmanagement, and  reservation  systems. Key pieces  of  information-gender, age, place  of residence, and types of casino games playedhelp predict which customers are most likely to  become  frequent  users. Based  on  this  information, Harrah's designs marketing strategies  to  retain  those  customers. Customers' purchasing and gaming patterns are tracked, too, so  that  the  company  can  target  its  customers with the most appropriate incentives. For  example, customers  who  reside  outside the  local  area  receive  complimentary  hotel rooms  or  transportation, while  drive-in  customers  receive  food, entertainment, or  cash incentives (Nickell, 2002).\n\nData  mining  techniques  help  to  reveal data  patterns  and  relationships  that  can  be used to develop strong models for predicting the  potential  value  of  each  customer. Given that retaining a customer is less costly than attracting  a  new  one, building  strong  relationships  with  valued  existing  customers  can boost  profits. Having  information  regarding such  things  as  the  customer's  birthday, anniversary, and  favorite  foods  and  drinks  allows  a  hotel  to  provide  excellent, tailored customer service that cements brand loyalty. Harrah's discovered that the 30 percent of its customers who spent between $100 and $500 per visit accounted for 80 percent of company revenues and generated nearly 100 percent of\n\nprofits. In  the  first  two  years  of  its  rewards program, Harrah's  saw  a  $100-million  increase in revenue from customers who visited more than one property (Nickell, 2002). Currently, Harrah's ranks first in the industry in profit growth (Levinson, 2001).\n\nBecause  the  WINet  system  can  consistently identify which customers will be most valuable  over  the  long  term, data  mining  is also useful for determining when to avoid offering incentives to customers who are not lucrative. Harrah's  estimates  that  it  has  saved some  $20  million  by  withdrawing  incentives from customers who are not likely to return (Levinson, 2001).\n\nDespite  Harrah's  success, some  remain skeptical  of  data  mining's  customer  benefits and long-term financial payoffs. As an example, Susan Dobscha, co-author of 'Preventing the  Premature  Death  of  Relationship  Marketing,' advises hotels that giant central databases  'are  not  where  customers  want  a relationship forged.A customer would probably prefer a lower price over, say, having their beverage  choice  anticipated' (Mining  Hotel Data, 1998).\n\nAnother important caveat regarding data mining  is  that  any  relationship  discovered must  be  valid  to  benefit  a  company's  performance. When  British  Columbia  Telecom tried  to  reward  100  of  its  best  customers by  inviting  them  to  a  Vancouver  Grizzlies basketball  game, for  instance, it selected customers from the database comprising frequent 900-number users.After sending invitations  to  the  printer, the  marketing  staff realized  that  those  900-number  users  included a large number of sex-line enthusiasts. The company avoided a serious gaffe by refining the criteria to create a list of truly loyal guests (Press, 1998, 58-61).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "W hen  properly  employed, data  mining  is  a powerful and valuable marketing tool. However, simply investing in data mining technology may not guarantee success. As presented below, seven  guidelines  influence  the  effective management of data mining technology.\n\nGuideline  #1: Match  your  IT  priorities with an appropriate provider. There is high demand for and low supply of data mining expertise as more companies realize the potential  value  of  the  information  residing within  their  databases. To  capitalize  on  this demand, a  number  of  second-tier  research firms now  provide  data  mining  services (Brandel, 2001, 67-70). However, providers offer  a  wide  range  of  skill  levels. The  mostskilled providers can turn data into useful information. Companies that initially set clear priorities  have  a  greater  chance  of  reaping maximum benefits from data mining projects than  do  firms  that  are  unsure  of  their  goals (Stevens, 2001). Clear priorities include goals about  what  the  firm  would  like  to  achieve through  data  mining  and  when  it  will  be achieved. Without  goals  and  objectives  the hotel corporation is uncertain about what it is shopping for when seeking a data miner. It is also important to communicate these goals to prospective providers. When  selecting a provider, ask the following six questions:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto do your homework. It is crucial to invest in the latest appropriate technology because  it  is  extremely  expensive  and time consuming to switch products after one is installed-in no small part because switching products requires retraining the IT and marketing staff.\n\nhave to pay for any changes in 'functionality' throughout the life of the contract. Change-of-character clauses have caused many disputes because of the ambiguous nature of the term 'functionality' (Lacity and Hirschheim, 1995).\n\nGuideline #2: Build segmentation and predictive models. Building appropriate segmentation  and  predictive  models  necessitates  an extensive  knowledge  of  the  hotel  business. The sidebar 'Examples of Hotel-Guest Segments' provides  examples  of  some  of  the many  ways  that  hotel  guests  can  be  segmented (Kotler, Bowen, and Makens, 1999). Transient hotels, convention hotels, extendedstay hotels, and resort properties all segment guests  differently. Furthermore, guest  segmentation is distinctive for most hotel properties. Hilton's  and  Marriott's  propertymanagement systems segment and code markets at the property level, for instance, since each location has its own particular segments. A given property may serve a set of corporate clients, a group of government clients, and social clients (e.g., weddings and reunions). The segment  categories  contained  in  the  sidebar can be strung into a large set of combinations. Furthermore, a guest could potentially fit into several categories, which poses a challenge for current data mining techniques (Shaw et  al., 2001). As  a  consequence, finding  a  provider that has experience creating models in the hotel  industry  is  a  major  benefit. Additionally, even if the provider has hotel experience, it is critical that IT and marketing managers work closely with the provider to segment the market and build predictive data mining models.\n\nOnce a data mining model is built, confirmatory testing must be conducted to assess its predictive accuracy. For instance, a model designed to predict who will respond to a pro-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

After  the  model  is  constructed, a 'holdout' group from a previous promotion can be analyzed to verify reliability. If the holdout predictions do not replicate the results of the past promotion, then the model may not be significantly  predictive. To  further  enhance  accuracy, a  score  can  be  assigned  to  the  model based on the level of agreement between the holdout  group  and  the  entire  group. Subsequent refined models can then be tested and scored. Another standard approach to model validation involves drawing two random samples from the data. The first sample is used as a calibration sample to build the model, while the  second  is  used  as  a  holdout  sample  to evaluate the model built from the calibration sample  (Peacock, 1998b, 15-25). The  validation  process  requires  a  knowledgeable  IT professional, because  when  data  subtleties\n\nthat arise only in the sample are used to build the model, the model may be highly predictive of the sample but biased with regard to the  population  (Shaw et  al., 2001). This  is called overfitting the data.To avoid creating a biased  model, the  IT  professional  must  be knowledgeable  of  the  analytical  procedure and possess a basic understanding of the hotel segment  and  promotional  scenario  from which the sample was extracted.\n\nGuideline #3: Collect data to support the models. Accurate data collection is critical for successful data mining. The major obstacle to effective data mining, however, is inadequate data gathering and  input (Smith, 2001, 36-37). Data problems lead to a decrease in the value of any data warehouse, in addition to diminishing the value of proposed models (Shaw et  al., 2001). Problems  with  data  are related to one or more of at least three different shortcomings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe first possible difficulty involves missing or inaccurate data. For example, when occupation information is available for only 15 percent of a data set, it is difficult to create a profile of customer occupations. Then again, it's a problem if the data file contains occupation information for 90 percent of the population, but  the  accuracy  of  the  information  is poor. Hotel corporations can reduce inaccuracy of this kind by asking guests for their current occupation.\n\nA second obstacle is poorly coded data. Databases  must  have  standards  regarding data formats, text case, and redundant codes (Stevens, 2001b).Although some software automatically  formats  the  data  properly, most do not. Problems then occur when data-input sources are added over an extended time and no one has ensured that the data entering the warehouse is properly formatted. This would occur, for instance, if, when original data mining technology was installed, predictions were made based on the  reservations  system  and the property-management system, but then a subsequent decision was made to input data from  guest-satisfaction  surveys. Problems would transpire when additional data inputs are not standard or are coded improperly. For example, some  models  require  continuous and ordinal data, while others demand categorical data fields or binary constructs (Siragusa, 2001).\n\nA third potential problem involves using homonyms (that is, putting the same label on two or more different data elements) and synonyms (that is, using two different labels for the  same  data  element)  (Chopoorian et  al., 2001, 45-51). While it may seem tautological to advise precluding this occurrence, the most common culprit is a new user on the system. It  is  common  for  hotel  and  IT  professionals to  change  companies  from  time  to  time.\n\nTurnover causes coding problems when new employees  bring  their  old  labels  and  fail  to use their new employer's framework.\n\nGuideline #4: Select the appropriate tools for analysis and prediction. Numerous analytical tools can be employed to transform data into  useful  information. Some  of  the  lesscommon analytical tools used by data mining software  include  regression  models, factor analysis, cluster  analysis, structural  equation modeling, and  self-organizing  maps. On  the other  hand, the  most  common  statistical methods used in data mining applications are decision  trees, neural  networks, and  genetic algorithms. As previously mentioned, a decision tree is a rule-based model constructed of nodes  (decision  points)  and  branches  (connections  between  nodes)  that  reach  numerous outcomes based on traveling through two or more nodes. A neural network is a nonlinear predictive model that resembles a biological neural system and has the ability to learn through training. Last, a genetic algorithm is a learning-based model founded on the concept of evolution.That is, partial solutions to a scenario compete with each other, and then the best  solutions  are  used  for  further  problem solving (Hair et al., 1998).\n\nMost  of  the  statistical  methods  employ techniques  that  achieve  a  desired  outcome. Likewise, each  methodology  has  strengths and weaknesses, and each is appropriate for a specific  scenario. Therefore, the  most  effective  results  emanate  from  data  miners  who have the expertise to select the most appropriate statistical method for a given scenario and  the  hotel's  intended  goals  (Siragusa, 2001). For instance, a positive attribute of genetic algorithms is that they converge on an optimal solution, but the method is most applicable to large databases since arriving at a valid outcome may require many generations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof  competing  solutions. Likewise, there  are also pros and cons associated with neural networks. They are beneficial in analyzing complex data because of their ability to discover unusual  trends, but  monitoring  accuracy  is difficult because many intricate relationships are  handled  invisibly  by  the  methodology (Hair et al., 1998).\n\nGuideline  #5: Demand  timely  output. Timeliness is critical in making marketing decisions. The  length  of  time  required  to  produce output varies widely among data mining packages. Before  Hilton  Corporation  upgraded  its  data  mining  technology, for  instance, the  reports  that  managers  requested from IT would take three to six weeks to arrive. 'By the time they'd get the report, it was often too late to act on it,' said Joanne Flinn, vice president of leisure marketing. With the new technology, managers receive reports in 30 minutes or less (Stevens, 2001b).\n\nGuideline  #6: Refine  the  process. By  its nature, data mining involves knowledge that evolves  over  time. Never  complete, data mining involves a continuous cycle of inputs and  outputs  based  on  models  that  must  be modified and refined as conditions change in the  competitive  environment. Flexibility  is needed to adapt the established models and processes to changes that occur (Cline, 2000). Refinement consists of three actions:\n\nterns  in  one  segment  and  similarities  in purchase patterns among other segments may lead  to  refinement  of  the  segment, usually  by  adding  a  new  criterion  or  dimension. This action can result in the discovery of previously undetected segments with homogenous characteristics.\n\nGuideline #7: Hire a well-trained staff and a  knowledgeable  IT  manager. Information technology was initially viewed by the hotel industry  as  a  back-office  function  that  supports the finance and accounting areas (Cline, 2000). The industry has advanced far beyond this view during the past decade. In two sessions  sponsored  by  the  International  Hotel and Restaurant Association (IH&RA), one in Singapore  in  1997  and  the  second  in  Nice, France, in  1998, hotel-industry  leaders  pondered the role of technology. Among the conclusions reached were: 'Going  forward, technology  will  be  the  most  competitive weapon for any hospitality company. If hospitality organizations want to compete successfully, they must do so by using technology to drive value to both the customer and to the firm' (Olsen  and  Connolly, 1999, 29). However, implementing such recommendations at the property level can be a difficult task.\n\nTraining is a key to effective implementation of data mining systems. Productive data mining  requires  two-fold  proficiency  among both IT managers and those who interpret the outputs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe hotel's IT managers must also be proficient  with  the  data  mining  system  because the  system  requires  continuous  refinement. Just as market segments, sources of data, and property  goals  change, so  must  predictive models and analyses be modified and refined. It is an unsound policy for the IT staff to be totally  dependent  on  the  provider's  recommendations  for  refinement  and  alterations. Instead, the IT staff and data mining provider should  work  together, with  their  common goal being to maximize the technology's effectiveness. The most effective data mining projects  occur  when  IT  managers  and  providers collaborate and share project information.\n\nSecond, adequate  training  must  be  provided  to  all  potential  users  of  data  mining outputs. At  the  corporate  level  this  includes the marketing staff, operations managers, and those developing new properties. Users at the property  level  include  general  managers, directors of sales and marketing, and the sales staff. Users  must  be  instructed  about  the available reports and how to properly interpret the information. Since the information is used for decision making, it is important for users to understand the boundaries and limitations of the information.\n\n",

Along  that  line, data  mining  cannot capture  all  the  information  relating  to  what drives  consumer  behavior. Data  mining  is simply one of a number of research methods that  help  predict  travelers'  demand  trends. Therefore, data mining technology should be used  in  conjunction  with  other  forecasting and  research  techniques. With  this  in  mind,\n\nmanagers  should  be  aware  of  the  following four limitations of data mining technology.\n\nLimitation #1: Data mining analyzes only data  collected  from  existing  customers. Data mining software generates information by analyzing data patterns derived from the company's  reservation, property-management, and  guest-loyalty-program  systems. Patterns thus detected can help predict the actions of current guests in the system and of those with similar  needs  and  wants. Data  mining  technology  does  not, however, provide  information about market segments not found in the company's  databases. Moreover, a  market segment that is currently small but is on the verge of experiencing substantial growth may not be detected by data mining.\n\nAnother  blind  spot  is  the  data  in  competitors' reservation systems. A key question in planning a marketing strategy in the hotel industry is: Who are my competitors' guests and where are they coming from? Data mining  technology  is  unable  to  answer  those questions.\n\nLimitation #2: Databases used in the mining process are often hotel-brand specific. Just as  data  mining  cannot  analyze  competitors' markets, it also creates prediction models that are brand specific. Thus, corporations that operate multiple brands often must create a data warehouse and conduct data mining for each brand.This is also true for the franchisees that may have a portfolio comprising, say, six Holiday Inns and four Marriotts.\n\nBrand-specific  marketing  information  is useful for the brand's corporate office to plan marketing  programs, which  is  largely  what franchisees purchase. Conversely, brandspecific  marketing  information  may  not  be helpful  if  the  hotel  corporation  that  franchises numerous brands wants to predict customer  demand  based  on  a  multiple-brand portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Makens, Mar- keting for Hospitality and Tourism, 2nd ed. (Up- per Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1999).\n\nLimitation #3: Data mining may not segment  travelers  by  psychographic  traits. Segmenting  consumers  based  on  psychographic traits, such as personality and lifestyle, can be useful  in  the  hotel  industry. This  is  because psychology and emotion play significant roles in the hotel guest's decision process.That is, as seen  in  the  sidebar 'Psychological  Determinants  of  Demand,' a  traveler  may  select  a destination for a variety of psychological reasons  (Kotler et  al., 1999). One  limitation  of data mining is that common system inputs do not account for psychological factors that influence a traveler's purchase decision.\n\nA time-tested tool used in understanding hospitality  demand  trends  is  Stanley  Plog's psychographic  scale  (Plog, 2001, 13-24). Many  key  drivers  of  demand  identified  by Plog, such as personality distribution among travelers  (e.g., dependables, venturers, and centrics), are  not  common  inputs  into  data mining systems. Hotels can acquire this information from customer surveys.\n\nLimitation #4: Data mining does not provide  information  about  consumers'  thought processes. It is important  to  engage  consumers in research to better understand their thinking. Information generated by data mining does not account for the fact that approximately 80 percent of human communication is nonverbal (Zaltman, 1997, 424-437). Inter-\n\nviews and focus groups are both useful methods  for  gathering  information  about  the needs and wants of hotel guests. The insight gained  from  those  techniques  is  difficult  to capture in the statistical data mining outputs. That is why it is important to step back and ask what the hotel guest's inherent needs are and what the product is really about. This involves  conducting  in-depth  conversations with  guests. At  times, improved  insight  and perspective  are  gained  from  talking  with three customers for two hours rather than by surveying  a  thousand  customers  (Ohmae, 1999).\n\n",

Based  on information derived from data mining, hotels can  make  well-informed  marketing  decisions-including who should be contacted, to whom to offer incentives (or not), and what type of relationship to establish.\n\nData mining is currently used by a number of industries, including hotels, restaurants,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nauto manufacturers, movie-rental chains, and coffee  purveyors. Firms  adopt  data  mining to  understand  the  data  captured  by  scanner terminals, customer-survey  responses, reservation  records, and  property-management transactions. This information can be melded into a single data set that is mined for nuggets of  information  by  data  mining  experts  who are familiar with the hotel industry.\n\nHowever, data mining is no guarantee of marketing  success. Hotels  must  first  ensure that existing data are managed-and that requires investments in hardware and software systems, data  mining  programs, communications equipment, and skilled personnel.

      "content": "In the third edition, this section on human resources  (HR)  became  a  different  creature than it had been in previous editions. It used to be called 'The Management and Processes of  Human  Resources' and  included  several how-to articles. I now believe the reader will be  better  served  by  contemplating  broad strategic policy considerations.\n\nPart of this shift in focus grew out of recent research that strongly suggests the future health  of  any  organization  will  be  based  on human resources-that is, of course, if HR is called upon by top management for advice on legally  and  functionally  delivering  hotel  services. A well-managed hotel HR department will be a competitive advantage.\n\nAmong observers and participants on the hotel management scene are those who compare  human  resources, formerly  personnel management, to the weather: Everyone talks\n\nabout it, but  no  one  does  anything  about  it. This is a problem faced by a good many managers. If an HR department is to be effective in dealing with the people they recruit, hire, and train, they need a strategic view of the future and strategies to achieve that view.\n\nIt has been said we should be very interested in the future, for that is where we are going to spend the rest of our lives. It has also been  said, 'Predicting  is  difficult, especially about  the  future' (Berra, quoted  in Woods, 1999).That was the premise of the lead article in  this  section  of  the  third  edition, by  Bob Woods. Now a professor in the Harrah College  of  Hotel Administration at the University  of  Nevada, Las Vegas, Woods  suggested that for this edition he convene a select panel of his colleagues at UNLV and, using a variation of a predictive model, discuss the future based on what these researchers and teachers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nknow about present  and  foreseeable  trends. Their wide-ranging and instructive discussion of the future challenges to HR is presented in 9.2.\n\nPerhaps the most insidious and pervasive human resource challenge the abovementioned group addressed was turnover. For whatever reasons, lots of employees leave hotel companies, and whenever they do, it is expensive-not only to the hotel but also to the employees. That is why Riegel's presentation of  a  conceptual  model of turnover is an important inclusion here. This material updates research  he  and  two  colleagues  did  among foodservice  employees, but  the  conceptual model holds equally well for hotel employees. It is included here because in many ways the strategic  concepts  of  legal  environment, HR professionalism, and management respect are avenues to control or reduce turnover.\n\nIn a series of guest lectures in my class at Washington  State  University, Jim  Treadway, formerly president of Westin Hotels and Resorts-North  America  and  currently  president and CEO of MTM Management L.L.C., outlined how he sees the job of hotel general manager. Among the components of his 'job description' is  'to  keep  the  owners  out  of jail,' by which he means the GM must manage the business without incurring legal trouble and must avoid all possible risk of liability. The essay by Murrmann and Becker on the legal environment discusses the realms of risk facing  hotels  and  their  human  resources  departments. Increasingly, hotels  are  finding themselves at legal risk for hiring 'high-risk employees.' The  most  professional  HR  departments are aware of and prepared to ad-\n\nvise  their  internal  customers  (department heads and the GM) how to employ the best people  without  running  afoul  of  the  everincreasing  regulatory  and  liability  environment. See also the essay by Melissa Dallas in Section 5.\n\nReinforcing  the  importance  of  considering the HR function in a strategic light rather than  an  enabling  one  is  the  article  included here by Tracey and Nathan. They argue that because  human  capital  considerations  are top-of-mind  in  research  and  trade  publications, leadership  still  fails  to  consider  HR when making strategic  plans  and  that  many firms  are  still  mired  in  archaic  policies  and practices  that  threaten  business  activities  in the  business  and  regulatory  environment. They argue their position cogently and with vigor; see if you agree with them.\n\nThere is no lack of research and commentary in hospitality publications, both academic and  trade, that  deal  with  human  resources. Many of the articles and essays in this book could be and should be looked at with an eye toward  their  implications  for  the  management of human resources in a hotel. Perhaps second only to marketing, human resources is the most written-about topic in not only the academic  but  also  the  trade  press. Readers are encouraged to find publications that offer solid, practical, objective, and legally valid advice  for  aid  in  determining  their  individual model of how a human resources philosophy and its resultant practices should be designed. A good place to start is the list of suggested readings  and  references  at  the  end  of  the chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "Christian Hardigree, Ellis Norman, Gail Sammons, Vince Eade, William Werner, Robert H. Woods 2 and Cheri Young\n\nIt has been five years since the publication of 'Predicting Is Difficult, Especially About the Future: The  Future  of  Human  Resources  in Hospitality Management,' the journal article used in the third edition of this book (Woods, 1999). As Yogi  Berra  would  say, since  then, the future has changed. Indeed, the future has changed, and it is time to attempt to forecast it once again.\n\nTime flies.Ten years ago, decoding the human genome was a pipe dream (Mack, 2005). Five years ago, terrorism was something that people outside the United States had to worry about. As Mack noted, 'Imagine if you could have understood the potential for such monumental changes before they happened' (Mack, 2005). The value of predicting the future is evidenced by the fact that major corporations  spend  millions  of  dollars  annually on studying the big picture, or macroenvironmental analysis, as most strategic planners call it. Futurists, those who predict the future, often  call  this  a six-sector  analysis, but it's  the same thing. A six-sector analysis uses trends and forecasts in technology, economics, environment, society, demography, and  government  to  predict  the  future. One  can  easily imagine  the  changes  that  have  occurred  in these six sectors since 1999.\n\nIn this article, we use what might be called a seven-person analysis-that is, the insight of seven  experienced  professors  from  the  University of Nevada-Las Vegas to predict the future. These  seven  professors  have  experi-\n\nence in a wide range of areas and were asked to lend their expertise to predicting the future of  HR  in  the  hospitality  industry. What  follows is an edited transcript of a lengthy discussion among these seven professors on this subject. We start with a discussion of the impact  of  unions  in  the  hospitality  HR  future and range widely from there.\n\nNote: This  chapter  has  seven  authors. Each is identified by name, and quotes are associated with each throughout. For instance, the first quote is from William (Bill) Werner, the second from Cheri Young, and so on.Topics are presented in random order.\n\nWerner: One of the big issues human resources managers will have to think about in the future is whether health care is or is not a natural right of every employee. Recently there was  a  merger  between  the  hotel  employees union  and  the  restaurant  employees  union. The  resulting  merger  is  a  union  of  about 500,000 members. One of the big discussions between  these  unions  has  been  about  even trying to merge with more unions and to follow the current corporate pattern of merger and acquisition. Employers are going to have to find a way to find a middle ground with the union stance that employees pay nothing for health  care  benefits, no  matter  what  other bargaining  positions  the  unions  might  assume.Eventually, this is something with which every employer is going to have to come to terms. Health  care  among  union  workers has  become  an  expected  normal  benefit  of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployment, but the cost is rising so fast, basically out of control, and employers are going to have to come to terms with this.\n\nYoung: Only  8.2  percent  of  the  private sector employees are unionized in the United States. Union  membership  has  steadily  declined from its peak decades ago and is at an all-time low. One question to ask of the future is  whether  this  trend  will  continue. Mergers among unions may be able to counter that decline, or the decline in union membership may continue.\n\nWerner: The political power of unions is the one thing that they still have to hang on to, and their political strength in Washington particularly really is the one thing that unions are still able to claim, despite their declining membership. Even if unions do not increase membership, they are likely to be able to hold on to what they have through amalgamation and mergers. The question is, will  unions  be able  to  turn  declining  membership  into  increasing  membership?  The  only  way  to  do this is through  union  organizing  efforts. Therefore, we are likely to see more of such efforts in the future. Unions are not likely to continue to decline without a fight, and that fight  comes  through  organizing  efforts. This means  human  resources  departments  and managers are more likely to need to address union issues in the future than they have in many years. Because unions have steadily declined, many human resources managers may not ever have had to address this issue in the past. Since hospitality organizations (and hospitality human resources professionals) today have  little  experience  with  unions  because they have not played a major role in recent years, they are likely to have to devote time and money to learning how to address such needs in the future.\n\nEade: In  the  1940s, unions  represented about 30 percent of the workers in the United States.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, today  unions  represent  about  12-14 percent of workers in all industries.\n\nNorman: According  to  statistics  recently released, unions now represent only about 12.9 percent of the workers in the United States.\n\nEade: While unions have been declining, cooperation  between  unions  and  hospitality organizations may not be headed in the same direction. There  might  be  more  cooperation in the future. There is significant evidence of this here in Las Vegas, where one can find several models of training and development cooperation between organizations and unions. Such mutually beneficial developments might hinder  the  growth  of  union  membership  in the future, or it might result in more growth. At  any  rate, such  cooperation  might  mean there  are  fewer, not  more, union  organizing efforts in the future.\n\nWerner: These cooperative efforts are interesting. The  largest  hotel  and  restaurant workers' unions have recently noted that they actually have a dual agenda-that is, working cooperatively  with  organizations  that  are good  to  their  employees  and  fighting  like dogs with those which are not. In 2004, for instance, we  saw  the  demise  of  the  Golden Horseshoe hotel and casino in Las Vegas.This demise began with a culinary union strike 11 years ago over health benefits.The union kept up their efforts for 11 years! When unions are pushed to the wall, they will fight.\n\nThe interesting part about the mergers we are seeing, however, is that unions with different  special  skills  are  merging. In  hospitality, we have seen the merger of a union with special skills in organizing with one that has special skills in striking employers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo me, this means that unions are likely to start going after companies which have been traditionally non-union in the past.\n\nYoung: It is my understanding that at one time unions fought against open immigration laws  because  they  believed  that  immigrants would  take  jobs  from  union  workers. However, in recent  years  some  unions  have adopted  a  policy  of  welcoming  immigrants. For  instance, UNITE  here  in  Las  Vegas  is largely made up of recently immigrated Latinos and Asians. The rapid population growth of these two ethnic groups would seem to indicate that some unions are likely to be able to exert more pressure on hospitality organizations in the future.\n\nWoods: Much of  the  future  on  this  topic might be attributed to the outcome of current political efforts to extend amnesty to illegal immigrants already in the United States. If this is done, are we not more likely to see an increase in hospitality industry union membership?\n\nWerner: This does seem likely, doesn't it? Eade: Many  recent  immigrants  working in  the  hospitality  industry  have  jobs  in  departments such as housekeeping in hotels. Because of this, some form of amnesty for illegal aliens certainly seems like it might affect how hospitality  human  resources  managers  work with employees in such departments.\n\nIt seems to me that one of the big issues in the future for hospitality unions will be outsourcing of jobs.\n\nYoung: Yes, I  read  recently  where  some California hotels were sending their laundry to  Mexico, having  it  washed  and  shipped back, thus outsourcing jobs.When we think of outsourcing we typically think of this happening in manufacturing sector jobs, but this example  indicates  how  it  might  happen  in service industries as well.\n\nNorman: There  are  already  hotels  that outsource all of their food and beverage operations, not to foreign countries but outside the organization nevertheless. This is a different type of outsourcing, but an important one to  unions, as  non-union  companies  are  providing the food and beverage operations. This means a net loss in jobs for unions.\n\nEade: The point is that in the future these will  be  life-and-death  issues  for  unions. We tend to look at issues such as this from the organizational  viewpoint. From  that  perspective, such  developments  might  be  relatively small  issues. However, for  unions  they  are life-or-death issues.\n\nWerner: The bottom line is that unions in the  hospitality  industry  will  be  forced  to  attempt  to  increase  membership. Some  hospitality unions  today  have  almost  as  many retirees  as  members  as  they  have  currently employed workers. Some unions seem to have taken  the  position  today  that  they  can  get more  new  members  by  attempting  to  decrease the workload of employees. For example, would  union  efforts to reduce the workload of housekeepers from an average of 16  rooms  cleaned  daily  to  an  average  of  12 rooms  lead  to  increased  membership, or would  attempting  to  maintain  health  care benefits for members be better for increasing membership? The unions deal with strategic issues such as this all of the time; they are always trying to predict what will be important in the future for their members. It may be that more immediately tangible efforts such as reducing  workloads  would  lead  to  more  new members than benefit extensions.\n\nSammons: An issue that concerns unions in the casino industry is the rapid and continuing development of casinos on Native American land. My understanding is that National\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLabor Relations Laws do not apply to such locations because they are on Native American land. Interestingly, unions fought against Native  American  casinos  because  they  believed  that  such  organizations  would  take away  union  jobs. Now  that  this  fight  is  lost and these casinos are growing rapidly, unions would like to be able to organize their workers. Politics breeds strange bedfellows, doesn't it?\n\nHardigree: Actually, some of the casinos that are being built on Native American land may have to adhere to NLRB (National Labor  Relations  Board)  requirements. For  instance, they do not if they are wholly owned tribal entities, but they do if they are a partnership  with  a  gaming  organization  such  as Harrah's or MGM.\n\nActually, I want to make sure that there's a  difference  between  what  laws  apply  to  a wholly owned tribal entity versus a partnership  with  a  Caesar's  or  a  Harrah's  or  something  like  that. Because  if  there  is  that partnership, they  do  have  a  requirement  to adhere to the NLRB. This also applies if the manager is employed by a non-Native American organization.\n\nThis is significant to unions because 5 of the  25  top-grossing  casinos  in  the  United States  are  tribal  facilities, but  some  of  them are partnerships with nontribal companies.\n\nYoung: This brings up a related issue because  the  human  resources  skills  needed  to manage in Native American casinos may be somewhat  different than the HR  skills needed in other sectors of the industry. Human  resources  professionals  would  have  to understand the importance of tribal cultural and work ethic issues, for instance.These casinos are providing jobs to some Native Americans  who  have  not  worked  in  years, for instance. The  HR  challenges  that  might  be\n\nfaced  in  such  an  environment  are  new  for most managers.\n\nHardigree: Such issues are not limited to Native American casinos. For instance, I did some work on employee training in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin  Islands. In  the  island  culture, as many people know,time is not as important as it is here on the mainland. One of the training issues  that  I  faced  was  training  employees that they had to show up for work at a specific time. In  some  cases  I  found  properties  that were  not  opening  on  time  simply  because their workforce had not showed up yet. People unfamiliar with human resources in the islands will have to learn how to address such issues in the future.\n\nWoods: The  responsibility  of  human  resources departments and managers to address the culture of their workforce seems to be a pervasive issue. This is as true in the United States today as it is in foreign countries.There are many hospitality properties in which the employees  are  predominantly  from  another culture  and  even  speak  another  language. I remember a few years ago talking to a general manager  from  a  hotel  in  Toronto  who  said that there were 60 different languages spoken by employees in his hotel. This is certainly a problem  that  hospitality  companies  did  not have to address 20 years ago.\n\nNorman: I agree, we sometimes forget to think about the impact of subcultures here in the  United  States. Some  employees  from other cultures do things a certain way before they eat and before they work and they don't show up when you want them to for various reasons. A  question  for  human  resources  in the future is whether or not the organization can prescribe strict rules and absolutes as they have in the past. First you have to understand the  way  things  work  within  the  subculture, then  you  can  attempt  to  effect  policies  that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napply. This means that human resources will become more complicated in the future. This becomes an issue of addressing the diversity of  all  employees, not  simply  those  who  are obviously  from  another  country. In  the  past employers have been able to say simply,'This is  the  rule  for  everyone.' In  the  future  this may not be so easy to do, as it has become incumbent on organizations to think about the individual diversity of its employees, too.\n\nHardigree: This  is  the  issue  in  many 'English-only' cases. English-only  refers  to organizations  that  prohibit  employees  from speaking their native language while at work. To managers this might seem logical-that is, employees  speaking  a  different  language might  be  threatening  simply  because  you don't  know  what  they  are  talking  about. Whether or not the same rules will be applied for everyone in such cases might lead to significant HR issues in the future as well.\n\nWoods: I  recently read an article from a futurist who believes that the clash of cultures in  organizations-that  is, the  clash  between the cultures of so-called native (or American) employees  and  managers  and  foreign  cultures-could  easily  destabilize  organizations in the future.\n\nYoung: It  seems  obvious  that, in  the  future, hospitality managers will certainly need to  be  more  culturally  sensitive  and  flexible than they have in the past. Hospitality organizations will be challenged to get the most out of their human capital but within the parameters of the cultural values of their employees. This  brings  up  some  interesting  challenges. For  instance, our  notions  about  motivation are based on our model, the American model of motivation. Some might call this the white Anglo-Saxon motivation model because this is who it has applied to in the past. Much has been written about motivation with this set of\n\nemployees. However, in the future managers will also need to know how to motivate employees from culturally diverse backgrounds as  well. This  means  that  managers  and  HR professionals will need expertise in areas that they are not today prepared to deliver.This, of course, will mean training in these (and perhaps  other)  areas  will  become  more  important in the future. Whether  this  means hospitality  organizations  will  have  to  spend more time and money on training in the future is not clear, but it certainly seems that is the case.\n\nWerner: When I was in grade school, we used to hear a lot about America as the melting pot of the world. The American ideal then seemed to be that anyone could come to this country and start over. However, the significant thing about that phrase is that it meant that those people would be gradually melted into  the  mix  and  everyone  would  come  out the  same. We  thought  then  about  a 'typical American.' There is much more appreciation today for diversity, and that has been a significant change in American society during my lifetime. Today there is more emphasis on diversity and less on assimilation through melting peoples together.\n\nCorporate  cultures  appear  to  have  emphasized the melting pot approach for many years. Everyone wanted to create a corporate culture and assimilate everyone into that one culture. Now  we  see  the  reverse  of  that  at work. In the future we may see people believing that the best approach is to forget corporate  culture. Instead  we  may  see  people thinking of corporations simply as legal entities  without  personality. If  so, the  emphasis then  will  be  on  employee  personalities, not corporate personalities.\n\nYoung: I disagree on that because I think organizations do have a personality. We call it\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncorporate culture and it ends up being a social organization. There's a whole social system in there  and  how  people  relate  and  get  their needs  met  and  power  and  politics  and  you name it. Looking at culture as something you created  as  a  corporate  control  mechanism might  have  been  prevalent  at  one  time  but not today or in the future. I believe that we have finally acknowledged this as a myth, that we have finally come to realize that we actually do have all these subcultures in organizations. Today we should think not of a melting pot but of a soup or stew. Now we see all these identifiable pieces floating around in the stew. Now and in the future HR people will have to peer  into  that  soup  and  figure  out  how  to make things work for all the ingredients.\n\nNorman: For  instance, in  Native American  and  Latino  cultures, family  is  more  important than it is in what has been known as the mainstream culture in the past. Family is the  number-one  priority  in  these  and  other cultures. Family is more important than work. The impact of this on work-based motivation practices  in  the  future  will  be  interesting  to see. In the traditional theory of motivation we have understood that certain practices by employers  will  lead  to  improved  work  performance by employees. This  is  not  necessarily true for all cultures.\n\nYoung: The  same  thing  could  be  said about Generation X. Much has been written about the failure of Generation X to put work first in their lives. Quality of life appears to be more  important  to  this  group  than  to  past generations. Quality of life is a priority over work in some cases. This group wants to believe  that  quality  of  life  is  more  important than some work-related issues.\n\nWoods: This all seems to tie together for HR in the future, doesn't it? Whether or not employees will be unionized might depend on\n\norganizational  approaches  to  diversity  and cultural  awareness, or even on how employees  are  motivated  to  work. It  is  a  big  challenge for HR.\n\nNorman: What is interesting to me is that in some organizations training seems to focus on  do's  and  don'ts  pretty  exclusively. Attempts to match the employee with the organizational  culture  are  not  as  prevalent  as trying to make employees behave in organizationally  specific  ways. For  instance, I  recently worked with an organization on casino card-dealer training. In this  instance, the  organization  was  spending  quite  a  lot  of  time training dealers in technical skills that they will seldom  use. For  example, dealers  are  taught how to perform card tricks like fancy shuffling and things like that. They will never use these skills in most cases, but this is the emphasis in training. In  comparison, orientation  for  these groups  consists  primarily  of  a  discussion  of what actions will get you fired. In effect, there is  no  effort  to  attempt  to  identify  the  person with the property and its values.\n\nIn  the  casino  industry, most  managers came up the old way, the 'hard way,' as they describe it. This means that they started as an employee, worked their way up to supervisor and then to manager.These people have good technical  skills; that  is  likely  why  they  were promoted. However, they  may  never  have had  any  experience  or  training  in  interpersonal  skills-that  is, managing  people. Yet, how  the  human  capital  of  the  organization will be managed and motivated will likely determine  the  company's  future  success. The HR department of the future will likely have to  address  more  managerial  training  than  it has in the past.\n\nWoods: For  several  years  we  have  been seeing  and  reading  about  the  lack  of  employee  and  managerial  loyalty  in  organiza-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntions. Most  predictions  are  that  people  will bounce from company to company in the future. In the past, of course, managers and employees worked for one organization most of their  lives. Predictions  are  that  people  will probably follow a pattern of working for one organization for five or six years, then moving on to another. In some cases these people will move  from  one  industry  to  another, taking time  off  between  the  two  to  retrain. Since most  current  employees  and  managers  produce at higher levels than new employees and managers, this  becomes  an  issue  of  how  to make work interesting enough for people to stay. Getting people not to quit then will become a focus of HR in the future.\n\nI'm glad you brought up managers, Ellis. I think the human resources department of the future  will  spend  more  time  on  managerial human resource issues that  aren't  employee human resource issues because of the changing  nature  of  the  managerial  workforce. All the  predictions  are, and  we  see  this  already, that people will not stay in the same job their entire career. They will probably follow a pattern of working five or six years in one organization, then  may  take  a  sabbatical  for  six months and retrain for another career or retrain for another year. So, I think what we'll see is more people moving from career to career to career-maybe not in the same industry-and that poses interesting problems for the human resources department.\n\nHardigree: And this might mean that HR personnel  will  be  training  older  and  older workers and managers in the future. It might become more common for HR people to have to know how to recruit, hire, and train employees and managers who are older in the future as a result.As these people bounce from career to career, they will need additional training at ages we are just not used to training.\n\nWoods: When  you  combine  this  movement between jobs with retirement issues for baby boomers, the problem becomes exacerbated. The baby boom population is starting to retire now and will retire in greater numbers in the future. HR people will need to decide how to address that issue in the future as well. This means not only how to address retirement issues for managers and employees but also how  to  address  replacing  that worker. Will  it  lead  to  downsized  organizations, which cannot find enough employees in the  future, or  will  the  employees  simply change dramatically as we have discussed earlier-that is, will workers from other cultures predominate? It seems that organizations will have to make a decision about which direction to go and, either way, more training will be  required. It  could  also  lead  to  increased job design changes, too. Will we change how work is done to accomplish it with fewer people, or will we simply employ a different type of worker?\n\nYoung: I know of one 82-year-old cocktail server at a hotel. Think of the problems associated  with  working  with  this  type  of  workforce  when  you  are  accustomed  to  working with a young workforce.\n\nNorman: In the past, we read predictions about how baby boomers were going to have such a huge impact on leisure and hospitality industries, and  we  have  certainly  seen  this. More and more people are taking advantage of leisure activities today than in the past, and this has certainly helped to increase revenues for hospitality companies. However, there are also  indications  that  baby  boomers  will  not necessarily  opt  to  retire  for  many  reasons, from personal to economic. One characteristic of  the  baby  boomer  population  is  the active  lifestyle  of  its  members. Some  people are  working  out  more, exercising  more, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nworking later into life. The rapid changes in medical care and life expectancy are affecting this too, of course. Some people simply work longer because they live longer.\n\nWoods: This might certainly mean that eldercare issues will become more prevalent for HR, too. We think of eldercare today as how to  address  the  issues  of  older  citizens, but these people may also be employees. HR will have to deal not only with how to address the challenges  employees  face  from  taking  care of both elderly parents and children, but also the issue of how to make work accessible and meaningful for a more elderly population.\n\nHardigree: HR already has to address the issue  of  younger  workers  who  believe  they are ready for management, or managers who want to move up but can't because the baby boom population is blocking their path. Baby boomers  are  not  leaving  these  positions  as quickly as predicted, and as the next generation is coming of age they feel they are entitled to move up-but those positions are not opening  up. I  think  this  also  contributes  to people moving back and going into different careers  and  reeducating  themselves  as  they move.This also leads to disgruntled managers and employees, some of whom have come to think  of  older  employees  as  roadblocks  to their own careers.\n\nYoung: The impact  of  baby  boomers  on retirement  issues  is  still  four  or  five  years away, but  not  long. What  will  happen  when this  population  attains  retirement  age  will certainly impact hospitality.\n\nWerner: This issue of moving from job to job  and  career  to  career  will  depend  on  the rate of unemployment prevalent at the time. People  who  once  enjoyed  the  opportunities associated with jumping from job to job and telling  their  employers  to  take  this  job  and\n\nshove it will be greatly influenced by the impact of unemployment issues. That approach is  okay  with  low  unemployment, but  what happens with high unemployment? You can't jump from job to  job  as  easily  when  unemployment is 10 to 12 percent.\n\nIn  the  future, HR  people  may  need  to adapt  to  their  organization  rather  than  vice versa. I think of this like coaching basketball. There are coaches who are very well known for their strategy, and they create a program and then they find people to put in it. Then there  are  other  coaches  that  take  whatever talent  they  have  and  make  the  most  of  it. I think that continues to be just different managerial skills and techniques. It will be interesting to see which type of manager, or coach, prevails  in  the  future. One  would  think  that those who can adapt will succeed more.\n\nNorman: I recently read a book about going from good to best. According to this, the enemy  of  best  is  good. It  reminded  me  of Steve Wynn, the casino icon in Las Vegas.You ask  Steve Wynn  if  he's  got  a  mission  statement; he doesn't have one.What he does do is get the right people on the bus to begin with. His approach is to find the best possible people and go with that instead of attempting to force everyone into one mold.\n\nYoung: Some people see human capital as an asset worth investing in because they believe that the employee is capable of generating  revenues  in  the  future. One  thing  that organizations must surely do in the future is develop ways of accounting for the value or worth of employees on the balance sheet. Because  people  in  organizations  make  indirect contributions, most companies do not do this today. The  HR  people  have  stomped  their feet up and down and said nobody thinks that we're important, nobody thinks we're impor-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntant. The  problem  is  that  HR  has  not  been able to equate human capital to dollars, so the people  making  decisions  today  in  organizations cannot relate. HR people are finally figuring out that if they compute human capital in  financial  terms, they  will  get  more. One mission of HR in the future is to learn how to do this better.\n\nEade: Work performance will be a more important term in the future. The human performance of people can make a difference in organizations, and HR is finally figuring that out. Organizations need a department of human performance that spends all of its time assessing  performance  and  figuring  out  how to  do  things  better. This  is  not  just  performance for the  bottom  line  but  performance for and by people.\n\nSome organizations are doing this through  training  programs  such  as  how  to manage  your  household, or  parenting  skills, or how to plan retirement. It comes down to organizations  showing  that  they  care  about employees. They have to show that they are attempting to improve performance in all areas, not  just  in  the  bottom  line. These  are likely  the  organizations  that  will  attract  and keep the best people in the future.\n\nYoung: Organizations need to assess and define  the  benefits  of  such  programs. They need  to  answer  the  question  of  why  they should train people in parenting skills, for instance. The  answer  is  in  empowerment. As people learn how to better manage their lives, they gain a sense of control over their environment, and that helps them to perform better. Hopefully  these  same  employees  will make  the  connection  between  what  the  organization is doing for them and commitment or loyalty to the organization.\n\nEade: It's  either  this  or  move  to  inde-\n\npendent  contractor  status  with  employees, and that seems worse. We seem to be moving toward  the  independent  contractor  type  of relationship between organizations and employees.\n\nWoods: I read recently that the half-life of an  engineer's  knowledge  is  now  six  months. This means that college freshmen will have to renew their knowledge base five or six times during  their  college  careers. Just  think  how this  might  affect  the  workplace. I wonder how true this  is  for  hospitality  management education?\n\nYoung: Another  issue  for  hospitality  is how  women  are  treated. Housekeeping  is  a female ghetto in many organizations. Let's get a woman to be the director of rooms or the CEO or the VP of finance.\n\nNorman: In  the  1980s, the  executive housekeeper reported not to the GM or the executive committee but to a person three or four rungs below.We have made progress, but it's slow.\n\nHardigree: We still use lots of sexist terms in hospitality. We also have jobs reserved for one gender or another. For instance, we still use cocktail waitresses in most properties, and too often they are still hired on the basis of height and weight. Not everyone is five foot nine and 125 pounds, and hospitality needs to address that in the future. Many customers today  want  to  see  a  diversity  of  employees  in places  they  frequent, partially  because  they, too, are  diverse. Customers  like  to  see  employees who look and act like they do.\n\nChristian: From an Asian standpoint, am I discriminating  against  Asians  because  I  require  all  my  dancers  to  be  five  foot  nine  or taller?\n\nYoung: Now are there lawsuits coming up about this?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristian: I've seen a few claims. I don't know if they've resulted in full-blown litigation. Cosmetic practices, such as use of terms like cocktail  models to  avoid  the  genderspecific  term waitress, just  do  not  do  the trick.\n\nWerner: The average hospitality discrimination case results in a judgment of only about $7,500. As  a  result, many  companies  are  not too  concerned  about  this  issue. Most  customers  believe  that  the  awards  are  much higher. This  is  an  example  of  a  fundamental philosophy that needs to change in hospitality.\n\nEade: This issue of segmenting women for certain  types  of  jobs, even  specific  shifts, needs to change to satisfy the customer base. For  years  companies  got  away  with  saying that women could be security guards, but not at  night  . . . and things like that. In fact, one case that did go to court resulted in a win by the company, which said they were only thinking  about  the  safety  of  the  female  guard  in question. Today we have female soldiers dying in war, and this has forced some companies to rethink their position on such issues.\n\nHardigree: In some cases, changes in this type of issue must wait for the courts to catch up. For instance, in one case a man with disabilities wanted to do a job that the company thought was too dangerous for him. He sued, and the company won.The court believed the company was only trying to protect the employee from himself.\n\nI strongly believe that one of the changes we will see in the future is more acceptability of sexual orientation issues. Today, there are only  about  12  states  that  protect  employees based  on  sexual  orientation. Some  of  these may actually  repeal  their  laws  on  this  issue, sensing  that  the  public  mood  has  changed. The  public  mood  may  or  may  not  have changed, but  what  companies  need  to  be\n\nafraid  of  is  using  gender  discrimination  to bootstrap a sexual orientation claim.\n\nYoung: The whole issue of whether or not to extend benefits to gay partners really raises the larger issue of who should receive benefits. What do you do about two heterosexuals who have lived together for 15 years? Many people today are living  together  and  having children outside marriage. They are going to start  screaming for benefits as well, and this may be a significant issue in hospitality.\n\nWoods: We  may  find  that  the  more  we disenfranchise  people, the  more  viable  they become as a political  entity. I  expect  this  to happen  within  hospitality  due  to  the  large number of gays and lesbians employed there.\n\nSammons: One of the cultural issues we are  likely  to  deal  with  in  the  future  is  the growth of spirituality in the workplace. I don't mean just religious spirituality, but all kinds. As more and more people serve in overseas positions, they  are  likely  to  bring  back  new and  different  kinds  of  spirituality  to  their workplace.\n\nWoods: I read the same thing in a futurist publication  recently. Many  futurists  believe that  organizations  will  be  forced  to  address the spirituality of their employees soon.\n\nSammons: One issue I see being more important in the future is that of training. I mean who and what we train. Some companies are outsourcing training; others are keeping it inside  their  companies. Organizations  will  decide which approach they want to pursue.The objective for most companies will be how to acquire  needed  training  at  the  lowest  cost. Sometimes  this  can  be  done  through  third parties.\n\nWoods: An  issue  for  hospitality  will  be what happens to the HR department if you outsource some aspects. Does the department become more or less fundamental to the com-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npany, and, if it becomes less fundamental, who in  the  corporation  will  look  after  the  rights and  issues  of  employees  that  we  have  been talking about?\n\nWould  companies  hire  human  capital agents, or would they simply ignore employees more than they do today?\n\nSammons: In some organizations, HR has been  included  on  the  executive  committee and  is  respected  as  an  important  strategic partner  in  the  company. Others  see  HR  as functional only and not part of strategic development. Which  method  a  company  employs will likely have a major impact on how their employees view the relationship. Hence, it  may  drastically  affect  the  performance  of employees and companies.\n\nHardigree: I  wonder  what  impact  outsourced training may have in the future. Few employees  view  training  programs  as  something that they want to do today; perhaps that is because of how the training is approached. What happens in the future when you have an outsider  come  in  and  attempt  to  conduct training sessions? My guess is that some employees  will  resent  this  and  others  simply won't care.\n\nSammons: Some outsourced training may be acceptable and other types may not be. For instance, we have outsourced food processing in hospitality for years.At one time, of course, most food processing occurred on site. Today we commonly see packaged products. Training  in  how  to  handle  this  type  of  product might  be  acceptable  to  employees  because the processing is done outside, while training on other issues may not be acceptable. Sometimes  the  cutting  edge  of  technology  is  outside the corporation, of course, and organizations need to take advantage of that. This occurred back in the 1980s when pointof-sale technology arrived in hospitality. Or-\n\nganizations  learned  that  the  training  from outsiders  didn't  really  stick  with  employees until they, themselves, understood the processes.\n\nYoung: What if  we  think  about  the  outsourcing of the entire HR program? I don't think that's a fantasy; it could be a reality. It kind of follows along the lines that we don't see HR as strategically critical to the organization because HR hasn't been at the executive  committee  table  for  that  long. What  if hospitality  companies  outsource  the  entire HR  department?  I  see  that  as  being  a  bad thing because we know that human capital or human performance and the ability to get the most out of your employees is one of the only sustainable competitive advantages out there. If it's true that HR has a sustainable competitive advantage, then typically you're going to want  to  do  it  in-house  because  you  do  not want it replicated. Unfortunately, I don't believe  many hospitality executives agree with us on this issue. While we see it as bad in the long term, they see it as good in the short run. They also can always bring HR back in-house. We can probably expect those companies on the  top, the  really  great  companies  in  our industry, to  never  outsource  HR  because they  believe  it  is  too  important. Others  will outsource.\n\nSammons: Outsourced  HR  has  grown from a $2.5 billion industry in 2002 to what is expected to be over $15 billion in 2005. However, I agree that what we are likely to see are outsourcing of some processes, not whole HR departments.\n\nYoung: Some  processes  do  not  have strategic  advantage. For  instance, everyone does fire safety training, and it is pretty much the same in most companies. This type of HR training does not increase strategic advantage and could, and perhaps should, be outsourced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the future so that HR departments can concentrate on more important issues.\n\nSammons: The issue is money. Outsourcing saves money. If it didn't, third-party companies would not exist.\n\nWerner: I think the future of outsourcing can  be  anticipated. Ten  years  ago  we  didn't have this word in our vocabulary.Today we all use it.\n\nEade: However, we  have  always  outsourced jobs. We called it subcontracting for many years, now outsourcing. It  is  the  same thing. In the 1970s, many hospitality companies  subcontracted  many  parts  of  their  HR departments. Then  they  mostly  brought  the processes back in-house, so it's back to the future for hospitality.\n\nYoung: Hospitality owners today are expecting more. They expect every department to  make  money. Food  and  beverage  was, at one time, viewed as a service, an amenity for guests. This is no longer true. Today every department has to make money or it will be outsourced or closed. Hotels learned a long time ago how to turn a food and beverage operation  space  into  retail  shops  because  they make more money. Mean, lean, and flexible, that's what owners expect today.\n\nSammons: How people are trained has an impact on outsourcing. In 2001, for example, using a lead instructor in a classroom-like environment completed 77 percent of training. Two years later this had dropped to 69 percent of training. We are replacing people-led training with Internet and computer training because  it  is  more  cost-effective. We  may never  see  the  day  in  hospitality  where  less than  50  percent  of  training  is  done  through some means other than instructor-led, but it is likely to be close that percentage. It may well depend on the age of the employees and managers  being  trained. Some  age  groups  are\n\nmore amenable to computerized and Internet training than others.\n\nAnother issue of interest to HR in the future  might  be  how  part-time  workers  are used. We  now  have  on-call  boards  in  most hospitality  organizations  for  most  revenueproducing positions. We are likely to see that expand  to  security  issues  because  of  the  increased criminal and terrorist threat.\n\nEade: How to address the needs of parttimers and on-call personnel will be a big issue in the future, and we have not even talked about it. What do you do about those on-call steady  extras  working  for  you, building  loyalty? The  question  for  organizations  will  be how to keep them on board. This is only one of the many issues that may be important in the future.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Carl D. Riegel\n\nTurnover is and has been a pervasive problem for the hospitality industry. Substantial anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  turnover  rates can  reach  as  high  as  200  or  300  percent  in rank-and-file positions, and  management turnover, at least at the operations level, can approach 100 percent in some organizations. While the importance of turnover as a problem for our industry was somewhat obscured by the recession of the early and mid-1990s, it has moved to the forefront with the advent of unprecedented full employment.\n\nA  low  unemployment  rate  presents  a three-pronged  challenge  for  the  industry. First, the  number  of  workers  in  traditional target  markets  for  hospitality  is  decreasing. This  is  likely  to  remain  this  way  for  some years to come. Second, unless the industry can present  opportunities  for  meaningful  advancement  in  pay  and  responsibility, it  will\n\ncontinue to attract, in large measure, a transient workforce-that is, employees will view working  in  the  industry  as  something  to  do while  they  prepare  to  do  something  else  or while  they  wait  for  'something  better' to come along. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, 'something  better' can  easily  be found by talented people who are not happy working  in  the  industry. Finally, despite  unprecedented efforts  to  change  its  image, the industry  is  frequently  perceived  as  the  employer  of  last  resort  rather  than  the  muchtouted  employer  of  choice. Although  this perception is probably not deserved, it acts to make the current labor shortage much worse for  the  hospitality  industry  than  for  many other fields of employment.\n\nFor  service  industries  like  hospitality, turnover is a serious problem. It makes an existing workforce shortage worse, and in some\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncases it can be argued that turnover is a symptom  of  an  insidious  organizational  disease. More  important, however, is  that  recent  research has established a strong link between employee satisfaction  and  overall  profitability. In this article we examine the concept of turnover  in  detail-what  it  is  and  why  we should care. Next, we examine what many believe to be the causes of turnover, and we then turn our attention to emerging areas of concern about the real costs of employee turnover. Finally, we examine what some researchers  believe  will  help  stem  excessive turnover.\n\n",

      "content": "I n general, turnover refers to either voluntary or involuntary separation from organizations (Bluedorn, 1982). Involuntary  separations (firings)  can  be  a  problem  if  they  occur frequently, but the focus of this article is primarily on voluntary separation from organizations-that is, the process by which people quit their jobs.\n\nHistorically, hospitality organizations have  perceived  turnover  in  two  ways. First, many companies are concerned that turnover costs the organization money and, because of that, unacceptable  levels  should  be  avoided. Turnover costs money for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nSome hospitality firms take the view that turnover  is  not  necessarily  undesirable  because performance and longevity have an inverse  U-shaped  relationship. As  Figure  9.1 suggests, performance  increases  over  the short to the intermediate term but decreases or stagnates over the long term-that is, the longer employees stay, the less likely they are to  demonstrate  increases  in  performance. More  importantly, the  longer  they  stay, the more they cost in raises and increased benefits. Firms  adopting  this  tenure/performance position are concerned primarily with the distribution of tenure throughout the organization and  more  likely  to  concentrate  on appropriate rates of turnover rather than reduced rates of turnover. For many firms holding this philosophy, turnover control strategies may be viewed as not worth the effort when pay raises are combined with antic-\n\nSource: Adapted from Staw.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nipated future performance. The problem with both of these philosophies, as we show later in this article, is that they are limited. They view turnover as an event or phenomenon rather than a process. Thus, it is the event that managers must control rather than the process. A more expansive and probably a more effective approach does not focus on the turnover event per se; rather, it comes from a process perspective  that  views  turnover  as  but  one outcome of a sequential chain of events. Before  we  discuss  this  notion  of  phenomenon\n\nversus process, let us turn our attention to the causes of turnover.\n\n",

Models sometimes  oversimplify  the  processes  they represent; however, a  model  is  useful  to provide a reasonable approximation of reality and is, therefore, useful in assisting our understanding and predicting outcomes.\n\nThe model shown in Figure 9.2 uses 'intent to leave' as a measure for actual departure. Intent to leave is a surrogate or stand-in measure; however, it has been well substantiated in previous research as a proxy for actual departure.As the model suggests, intent to remain in or leave an organization is a function of  two  related  factors: the  level  of  job  satisfaction and the degree of an employee's commitment to the organization. Job satisfaction is  also  influenced  by  individual  personality traits  and  specific  job  events. If  the  level  of job  satisfaction  is  high, then  the  employee's commitment to the organization tends to be strong and he or she will hold positive job attitudes and can be expected to stay on the job. On the other hand, if the level of job satisfaction  is  low, commitment  decreases, job  attitudes decline, and the employee, if given the opportunity, leaves  the  organization.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "W e  previously  explored  two  of  the  traditional  philosophies  that  describe  how  hospitality organizations  view  turnover. While these  philosophies  point  out  reasons  for  organizations  to  control  or  reduce  turnover, they offer a limited perspective of the potential  damage excessive turnover can have. As we  discussed  earlier, a  more  comprehensive\n\nmodel views turnover not as an isolated event but as a process. This process views turnover as a series of related events, and each of these events  can  have  negative  consequences  for employees  as  well  as  for  organizations. A closer  look  at  Figure  9.2  demonstrates  this. According  to  the  diagram, turnover  results from negative attitudes toward the organization and occurs only if an employee has the ability  to  leave. This  means  that  he  or  she must  have  other  job  options, not  need  to work, or not care to work. If employees have limited  or  unacceptable  options  and  do  not have  the  ability  to  leave  the  organization, they  may  adopt  other  withdrawal  behaviors such  as  complaining, absenteeism, poor  performance, or  unacceptable  customer  service behavior. This  implies  that  turnover  is  only one choice of a variety of withdrawal behaviors  available  to  disaffected  employees, and disaffected  employees  can  act  out  these  behaviors either as isolated occurrences or as a set of behaviors. Furthermore, the individual choice of withdrawal behavior depends on a variety of other factors such as degree of unhappiness, perception of self-worth, and, most importantly, the ability to find acceptable alternative employment.\n\nGiven  this  view  of  turnover, companies with high rates of turnover are likely to experience  a  variety  of  negative  outcomes. One way to categorize these outcomes is to look at how they affect individual employees as well as  how  they  affect  the  organization  in  both the short and the long term. Figure 9.3 indicates  that  both  organizations  and  individual employees  suffer  from  the  effects  of  high rates of turnover including attendance problems, decreased cooperation, decreased work performance, and  even  sabotage. In the longer  term, however, the  effects  are  more systemic  and  potentially  more  devastating.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor  example, high  rates  of  turnover  can worsen existing turnover rates, contribute to system problems such as poor customer relations, and even eventually limit a firm's ability to  develop  and  implement  strategy. The  potential  dollar  cost  of  this  is  incalculable  but potentially  enormous. A  question  of  major\n\nimportance for firms with high turnover rates is not only who leaves but also who stays. In some  cases, it  may  be  that  employees  who stay with an organization are not necessarily the ones the organization wants to keep and those  who  do  leave  are  not  necessarily  the ones  the  organization  wants  to  see  go. In\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsome  cases, outstanding  employees  find  the organizational  environment  so  dissatisfying they opt to separate from the company, and those who remain are those who can adapt to a  dysfunctional  environment  or  those  who have no choice but to stay.\n\nIn addition, there is evidence that excessive turnover rates can have a substantial and negative  impact  on  profitability. Recently, a great deal of discussion has centered on customer loyalty and the importance of avoiding customer defections. Simply put, the argument goes something like this. It costs a great deal to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Adapted from Heskett et al., 1994.\n\ncreate  new  customers. The  costs  associated with  advertising, promotion, and  other  marketing efforts are staggering.Thus it is wiser to try to retain existing guests than to create new ones. Furthermore, the longer customers stay with  a  company, the  more  they  are  worth. Generally, they  buy  more, buy  more  frequently, and  are  less  price-sensitive. In  fact, one  management  writer  (Reichheld, 1996) suggested that decreasing customer defections by as little as 5 points can double profits. With respect to the monetary value of customer or guest  loyalty, several  researchers  (Heskett et al., 1984) suggested a strong relationship between employee satisfaction, customer loyalty, and  profitability. They  call  this  concept  the service-profit  chain. As  Figure  9.4  illustrates, employee retention is a key driver in creating customer retention and is therefore a critical factor in determining profitability.\n\nThe  new  concerns  about  turnover  discussed  in  this  section  strongly  indicate  that the  conventional  thinking  about  turnover may capture just a small portion of its devastating effects. Now let's look at ways of reducing turnover.\n\n",

However, these strategies do not necessarily address the causes of excessive turnover and are likely to have limited effectiveness and to be short-lived.A longer-term solution would take into account the causes of worker dissatisfaction and attempt to deal with these in a comprehensive and continuous manner.\n\nFrederick  Herzberg  (1976)  suggests  that dissatisfaction occurs as a result of a lack of what he calls 'hygiene factors' and that satisfaction occurs as a result of what he calls 'motivators.' While  there  is  not  necessarily  any linkage in the organizational behavior literature  between  job  satisfaction  and  job  performance, a substantial  body  of  theory  does suggest  that  satisfied  employees  adopt  prosocial and, therefore, committed behaviors toward the organization. Herzberg says hygiene factors  that  can  cause  dissatisfaction  among employees include salary, working conditions, fringe benefits, and job security. While paying a  fair  salary  or  providing  job  security  decreases dissatisfaction, it does not necessarily create  satisfaction  in  employees. Motivators or  satisfiers  recognized  by  Herzberg  include achievement, recognition, challenging  work, responsibility, and  advancement. These  factors, if provided for by the organization, create  satisfaction  and  therefore  commitment. Thus, hospitality  managers  who  are  concerned about turnover as an insidious disease process should not only take care of the extrinsic  job  factors, such  as  job  security  and salary, they also must pay a great deal of at-\n\ntention  to  providing  opportunities  for  advancement, challenging work, and so forth.\n\nIn addition to attending to environmental factors  in  the  organization, paying  attention to the selection of employees in the first place goes  a  long  way  toward  quelling  dissatisfaction and, therefore, diminishing turnover. An axiom in the human resource field is that the goal of selection is not to hire the best-qualified employee but rather to hire the best employee for the particular job, the point being that it is important to match prospective employees to the organization and the position. Similarly, efforts to select employees who will be successful in a particular job as well as successful in the organizational culture enhance the likelihood of their retention. Selection is an important human resource function that is worthy of substantial effort and care.\n\n",

      "content": "Suzanne K. Murrmann and Cherylynn Becker\n\nFairness in the workplace is a significant issue affecting  the  productivity, loyalty, and  commitment  employees  have  to  their  organizations. The  treatment  an  employee  receives from his or her supervisor affects the worker's motivation  to  provide  excellent  service  to customers, ultimately  affecting  the  bottomline profits of the organization. Many factors influence workplace justice.These include the voluntary human resource management policies that organizations put into place to provide  fair  and  equal  employee  treatment. In addition, a significant number of federal and state laws and regulations protect employees from various forms of discrimination, provide employees with certain rights, and specify actions  employers  must  take  when  hiring  and managing  their  workforce. Such  laws  may vary in their wording and coverage from state to state. However, they generally mirror law at the federal level. These laws, which significantly affect the human resource function in hospitality organizations, fall under four general categories:\n\nThe  judicial  process  is  a  dynamic  one.\n\nContinual changes occur in laws and regulations due to amendments to existing laws, enactment  of  new  laws, and  interpretations made by courts and regulatory agencies. It is mandatory for managers to keep up to date with the status of laws that affect their HR activities. Even with appropriate legal counsel, day-to-day activities of supervisors and managers are often where organizations run into legal problems. Therefore, it is necessary that managers be aware of their legal obligations.\n\nBecause space does not permit a full discussion of all relevant employment laws, the following  text  concentrates  on  federal  laws that have seen significant changes in the last decade as well as those that are forecasted to change significantly in the next several years (Flynn, 2000; Goldberg, 1998). They  include sexual harassment and employer liability under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act, the Americans  with  Disabilities Act, the  Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Immigration Reform  and  Control  Act. A  discussion  of these  laws  and  implications  for  hospitality managers follows.\n\n",

      "title": "▶ SEXUAL HARASSMENT",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "I n general, sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome  sexual  conduct  in  the  workplace that  is  a  term  or  condition  of  employment. Complaints  of  sexual  harassment  fall  under two categories: quid pro quo and hostile work environment. Quid  pro  quo  harassment  is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsaid to occur when submission to or rejection of  unwelcome sexual conduct by an individual  is  used  as  a  basis  for  employment  decisions affecting an employee. In other words, when  a  supervisor  demands  sexual  favors from his or her subordinate and either promises an employment benefit, such as a raise or promotion, or  threatens  the  employee  with loss of such benefits, quid pro quo harassment exists. Such activities may be subtle or overt, and the employee must show that he or she belongs to a protected group, was subject to unwelcome harassment that was based on his or her gender, and that acceptance or refusal resulted or could result in tangible changes to the working conditions.\n\nWhile  quid  pro  quo  harassment  implies an exchange of sexual favors for work benefits, hostile  work  environment  harassment refers to the overall working environment in which employees function. Hostile work environment  harassment  is  conduct  that  unreasonably  interferes  with  the  ability  of  an employee to perform his or her job properly or  creates  an  intimidating, hostile, or  offensive  working  environment. This  may  be  so even  if  it  does  not  lead  to  tangible  or  economic job consequences. As in quid pro quo harassment, the activities or conduct in question are unwelcome by the employee and are based  on  gender. The  employee  must  also show that they are sufficiently pervasive and severe as to have caused an abusive working environment and that the employer is liable for  these  activities. Typical  examples  of  this type of harassment include unwelcome physical  touching; whistling, leering, improper gestures, or  offensive  remarks; unwelcome comments  about  appearance; sexual  jokes; and the use of sexually explicit derogatory or otherwise offensive language.\n\nSexual harassment in the workplace con-\n\ntinues  to  be  an  important  discrimination  issue, particularly  with  recent  Supreme  Court rulings  (Goldberg, 1998). Two  of  particular note, Burlington  Industries  v. Ellerth and Faragher  v. Boca  Raton, 1 have  significantly shaped  the  obligations  of  hospitality  managers. In  them, the  Court  clearly  articulated the  liability  of  employers  for  the  actions  of their  harassing  supervisors. First, in  cases  in which  an  employee  has  suffered  tangible, detrimental employment actions, such as demotion, termination, or  loss  of  benefits, the employer is strictly liable regardless of fault. Strict liability is premised on the fact that the supervisors are acting for the employer (company), and  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the employer can show it has an antidiscrimination policy, final responsibility rests with the company. In  cases, however, where  the  employee  has  suffered  no  loss  of  tangible  job benefits, the  employer  can  avoid  liability  by showing  that  reasonable  care  was  taken  to prevent  and  promptly  correct  any  sexually harassing  behavior. Documentation  that  the harassed  employee  subsequently  failed  to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer further minimizes the likelihood of employer liability for harassment charges.\n\nFor hospitality managers to protect themselves  against  charges  of  sexual  harassment, they need to focus on three major areas: (1) implementation  and  dissemination  of  antiharassment and complaint policies, (2) training of personnel, and (3) complaint investigation.\n\nThough  the  Court  has  not  specifically ruled  that  companies  must  have  policies specifically  targeted  to  sexual  harassment, many  human  resource  management  professionals feel employers can more  easily demonstrate their 'reasonable duty of care' by developing separate antiharassment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npolicies. Such policies should explicitly define sexual harassment, both in terms of quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment, and give  specific  examples  of  inappropriate  conduct. Though  this  point  seems  obvious, the policy  should  also  unambiguously  prohibit such conduct. It should also indicate protection  for  employees  from  retaliation  for  reporting  harassment. Numerous  studies  have shown that employees are often afraid to report  inappropriate  activities  because  of  fear of  retaliation  by  their  supervisors. Managers should  develop  and  include  in  their  policy multiple  avenues  for  filing  harassment  complaints. One  such  avenue  would  be  to  start with  the  employee's  immediate  supervisor; however, an additional route would be to bypass the supervisor and complain to an individual outside of the supervisor's direct chain of command. Assurance of prompt and thorough  investigations  and  privacy  are  equally important components of an antiharassment policy.\n\nAs  necessary  as  a  well-developed  and well-written policy is, it is also important that the policy be disseminated in such a way that all  personnel  in  the  hospitality  organization are aware of it. Merely including it in an employee handbook may not be sufficient. Antiharassment  policies  should  be  posted  in locations  regularly  visited  by  employees  as well as discussed with new employees. This is especially  important  in  an  industry  where  a significant part of the labor pool is composed of  employees  who  do  not  read  and  speak English as their primary language. The company  should  also  attempt  to  keep  written acknowledgment that each employee understands the policy.\n\nPeriodic training in what constitutes sexual harassment is essential for the prevention of  misconduct  in  the  workplace  and  the  de-\n\nfense of the employer against liability in court. The purpose of  such  training  is  to  make  supervisors  and  employees  aware  of  conduct that constitutes harassment and provide them with mechanisms for effectively dealing with it. T raining must be tailored to the individual workplace and take into account the diversity of  the  workforce; however, a  number of key components should be common to training in this area. Though all employees should attend training, separate sessions should be held for supervisors and managers to instruct them in their obligations to subordinates and their responsibilities  for  investigating  harassment complaints. The language and the customs of employees  should  always  be  taken  into  account when developing training materials, particularly  when  such  activities  as  role-playing are  used. Training  in  the  hospitality  industry should  take  into  account  the  interaction  of employees  with  third  parties  such  as  customers  and  outside  vendors. Managers  must be aware that the employer has an additional duty  of  care  in  the  area  of  customer  harassment of employees,and they should be trained to delicately but effectively deal with such situations. Finally, care must be taken to select an appropriate resource for carrying out training. This may be an in-house trainer or an outside individual or firm. In any case, the individual selected  should  have  recognized  expertise  in the area of sexual harassment.\n\nThe final area of concern for managers is prompt  investigation  of  harassment  complaints. The employer who fails to document fair investigation of employee complaints will more than likely be found liable for harassment. All  complaints  should  be  investigated as swiftly as possible by an unbiased investigator who is sensitive to the privacy concerns of  the  complainant. If, during  the  course  of the investigation, there is sufficient reason to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbelieve  the  complainant  and  the  accused should be separated, the complainant should not  be  assigned  to  a  lesser  job. Such  action could be seen as retaliation for filing a complaint. Relevant  material  and  information should  be  obtained, in  private, from  the  accused and additional witnesses. Based on this, immediate and appropriate corrective action should be taken by doing whatever is necessary to end the harassment, to make the employee  whole  by  restoring  lost  employment benefits or opportunities, and to prevent the misconduct  from  recurring. If appropriate, disciplinary  action  should  be  taken  against the  offending  supervisor  or  employee, ranging  from  reprimand  to  discharge. Generally, the corrective action should reflect the severity of the conduct. Document the findings and subsequent steps taken, if any, and place this documentation in a confidential investigation file. The  Equal  Employment  Opportunity Commission  policy  guidance  on  sexual  harassment suggests that follow-up inquiries be made  to  ensure  that  harassment  is  not  resumed and that the employee does not suffer retaliation. Finally, use what was learned from these  investigations  to  streamline  or  customize  future  training  and  policy  restatements in this area to more closely align with specific company needs.\n\n",

      "title": "▶ AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "T he Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits an employer from discriminating  against  a  qualified  individual  with  a disability with respect to job application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, training, and other 'terms,\n\nconditions, and  privileges  of  employment.' The Act has undergone almost a decade of interpretation by the courts, which continue to refine and define its coverage and the responsibilities of hospitality managers. As noted by many professionals in human resource management, these rulings at times leave as many unresolved questions as they answer concerning employer responsibilities.\n\nUnder the ADA, a qualified individual is defined  as  'an  individual  with  a  disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential function of the employment  position  that  such  individual holds  or  desires.' 2 There  are  two  questions the  manager  must  ask  when  determining whether an individual is qualified. First, does the individual satisfy the prerequisites for the position, such as the appropriate educational background, employment  experience, skills, or  licenses?  Second, can  he  or  she  perform the 'essential functions' of the position with or  without  reasonable  accommodation? The former is answered by comparing the qualifications  of  the  individual  to  job-related  requirements and production standards traditional  to  the  industry-for  example, number of rooms cleaned per day.When identifying  requirements, employers  should  use those  used  for  other  employees  in  the  position  and  not  those  selected  to  intentionally exclude the disabled person. The latter question may be answered by defining the fundamental job duties of a position in a well-constructed written job description. Factors  suggested  for  identifying  essential  functions  include  the  amount  of  time  spent performing the function, the number of employees  available  to  perform  the  task, the work experience of past incumbents and present employees in the position, and the consequence  of  not  performing  the  function. For\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninstance, several  courts  have  found  attendance to be an essential function of the job because the inability to maintain regular attendance creates an undue hardship upon an employer. 3\n\nA disability  is  defined  under  the Act  as (1)  'a  physical  or  mental  impairment  that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual,' (2) 'a record of  such  an  impairment,' or  (3)  'being  regarded  as  having  such  an  impairment.' 4 Impairments may include physiological disorders  or  conditions, cosmetic  disfigurements, and  anatomical  loss  affecting  one  or  more major body systems. Before 1998, it was generally accepted that for an impairment to be covered under the definition of a disability, it needed to be a permanent condition that, if uncorrected, substantially limited a major life activity  such  as  walking, seeing, hearing, or speaking. Several  Supreme  Court  rulings have  limited  this  definition, stating  that 'an individual's corrections, medications, and even  subconscious  mechanisms  for  coping with  an  impairment  are  to  be  considered when assessing whether that individual is disabled' and  covered  under  the  ADA  (Sherwyn, Eigen, and  Klausner, 2000). These rulings, though limiting the definition of a disability in one respect, in no way clarify the issue of what is considered a disability, nor may they actually limit the number of individuals claiming discrimination if managers continue to  perceive  individuals  impaired  even  with corrective devices.\n\nTraditional human resource functions and employment decisions can be considered discriminatory  under  the  ADA. These  include such  activities  as  recruiting, advertising, and the  processing  of  applications  for  employment, hiring, updating, promotion, termination, compensation, job  assignment, and  the\n\nlike. In  other  words, the ADA  mirrors, to  a great  extent, the  rights  of  protected  groups under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Hospitality managers should be aware of a number  of  issues  unique  to  disability  law. An employer risks violating the ADA by asking about medical conditions and disabilities in a preemployment  situation. Questions  at  this point should be job-related, with inquiry limited to the applicant's ability to perform the essential functions of the job as described in the  written  job  description. Preemployment medical examinations and tests, with the exception of testing for illegal drug use, are also seen  as  discriminatory  in  the  hospitality  industry. The  ADA  also  prohibits  disparate treatment  discrimination-that  is, limiting and segregating employees in a way that affects their opportunities because of a disability. A hospitality employer that demonstrated a pattern of hiring disabled job applicants for back-of-the-house, non-customer contact positions, though  such  applicants  were  able  to perform effectively in customer contact positions, would be demonstrating potentially discriminatory behavior.The use of employment tests  or  other  selection  criteria  that  are  not job-related to screen out disabled applicants is prohibited under the ADA. For example, if an employer requires an interview that is jobrelated and consistent with business necessity as part of the application process, it would not be  legal  to  reject  a  hearing-impaired  applicant solely because he or she could not be interviewed. 5 Finally, failure  to  reasonably accommodate disabilities of either job applicants or employees constitutes discrimination under the ADA.\n\nAccommodation for individuals with disabilities is at the core of the ADA. By law, reasonable accommodation mandates employers to  accommodate  qualified  individuals  who\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncan perform the essential functions of a job, unless this causes significant difficulty or expense-that  is, undue  hardship. 6 Accommodations can be modifications or adjustments (1)  in  the  job  application  or  testing  process that allow a qualified applicant with a disability  to  be  considered  for  a  position  equally with other applicants; (2) in the workplace or in the manner or method in which the job is performed  that  allow  the  employee  to  perform the job; or (3) that enable the disabled employee to enjoy the benefits and privileges of the job equally to those without disabilities. Types  of  accommodations  may  include  but are not necessarily limited to the following:\n\nThe EEOC has issued guidelines for employers to follow for compliance. Hospitality managers  should  follow  these  procedures. Using the interactive process outlined in the following guidelines should increase the likelihood  of  employees  viewing  a  manager  as reasonable and concerned about their needs.\n\nGiven the relative youth of the ADA, it is anticipated  that  interpretation  of  even  the most basic areas of the law-for example, the definition  of  a  disability-will  continue  to evolve. There are, however, certain steps that many  feel  to  be  appropriate  for  managers (Sovereign, 1999). Facilities  should  be  made as  accessible  as  possible. This  is  particularly true of the hospitality industry, given its public accommodation requirement. Because the concept  of  reasonable  accommodation  is based on a clear understanding of the essential functions of the job, well-written job descriptions are extremely important in managing liability associated with the ADA. With the exception of drug testing, all preemployment medical inquiries and examinations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshould be eliminated. Always attempt to accommodate a qualified disabled individual. A case of undue hardship can be made after accommodation is researched. Finally, in organizations  that  are  large  enough  to  support service  staff, an  individual  should  be  designated  as  the  ADA  resource  for  other  managers  and  used  when  accommodations  are requested.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "A ll  hospitality  employers  with  50  or  more employees  are  covered  by  the  Family  and Medical  Leave  Act  of  1993  (FMLA). The FMLA was passed in an attempt to balance the demands of the workplace with the family and medical needs of employees. Employers both in and outside of the hospitality industry expressed grave concerns over the impact of the  law  on  workplace  productivity  and  employer  compliance. Many  of  these  fears proved unfounded; many, however, were not. Compliance with the law has proved cumbersome, given  its  technical  recordkeeping  nature. Since  the  enactment  of  this  act, the Department of Labor (DOL), which oversees the FMLA, has seen thousands of complaints filed and has changed the guidelines and directives  to  comply  with  dozens  of  court rulings.\n\nThe  FMLA  allows  employees  up  to  12 weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to deal with family and medical issues. Companies  that  employ  50  or  more  people (within a 75-mile radius), including part-time and temporary workers, during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in a year are covered. In order for an employee to be eligible\n\nfor leave, he or she must have worked at least 1,250 hours for the employer. An eligible employee may take unpaid leave for the following reasons;\n\nThe  DOL  regulations  define serious health condition as any illness, injury, impairment, or  physical  or  mental  condition  that involves:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntreated, would likely result in a period of incapacity  of  more  than  three  calendar days\n\nAs  a  general  rule, ailments  such  as  the common cold, the  flu, earaches, upset  stomach, minor  ulcers, headaches  other  than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, and  periodontal  diseases  are  not  serious  health  conditions  unless  complications arise.\n\nEmployers  covered  by  the  FMLA  must post notice of the Act and their obligations as well as provide additional information to employees concerning their entitlements and obligations  through  standard  mechanisms  such as employee handbooks and manuals.An employee requesting leave is required to give 30 days notice to his or her employer, if possible. If  such  notice  is  not  possible, the  employee must provide 'such notice as is practical' so that the employer has an opportunity to plan for the employee's absence.As little as one to two days' notice (or less) may be sufficient in emergency situations. Employers may require a  medical  certification, such  as  a  doctor's statement, from a health care provider to support leave requests. Additional opinions concerning the employee's condition and periodic reports from the employee on leave regarding his  or  her  status  and  intent  to  return may also be required. During the time of the leave, the employer must continue existing health care benefits.\n\nLeave can be taken intermittently or on a schedule that reduces the typical number of hours per workday or workweek when medically  necessary. Incremental  leave  may  be taken in increments as short as one hour.\n\nUnder the FMLA, the employer is obligated  to  place  the  employee, once  returned from leave, in the same position he or she left. If  this  is  not  possible, the employee must be\n\nplaced in a position equivalent in pay, benefits, and  other  terms  and  conditions  of  employment. Based on rulings to date, 'equivalent' appears  to  be  construed  as 'identical' by the DOL.\n\nA  number  of  significant  compliance  issues cause difficulty for human resource professionals  and  employment  law  attorneys. Due to their technical nature, they are not discussed here. However, several issues are worthy  of  note  because  they  affect  hospitality managers and supervisors in general.\n\nWhile  attendance  has  been  successfully defended  by  several  employers  under  the ADA as an essential function of a job, FMLA leave  absences  cannot  be  used  in  discipline and termination decisions.Therefore, it is particularly important in intermittent leave situations  to  record  the  reasons  for  absences. Supervisors  should  be  encouraged  to  document  'verbatim  reasons' for  absences. This information allows a manager to conduct an 'FMLA audit' of employees who may be undergoing  disciplinary  action  for  excessive absenteeism.\n\nThough the FMLA does allow for managers  to  require  medical  certification  from employers for leave purposes, as well as second  opinions, overuse  of  such  information could open up liability under the ADA (Shea, 2000). Managers must be wary of asking for more  medical  information  than  is  necessary for  the  purposes  of  granting  FMLA  leave. Medical  certification  is  a  useful  tool  to  employ if there is doubt about the existence or extent  of  an  employee's  health  condition. However, it is not necessary as long as the absence has been noted as FMLA leave.\n\nA  'serious' health  condition  under  the Act  may  include  many  'minor' illnesses and conditions of short duration. Absences of less  than  three  days  may  also  be  considered\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlegitimate reasons for leave. This is due to the interpretation of the FMLA-specific wording. Indeed, many experts in the area agree that regulations  have  gone  beyond  the  intent  of the legislation in terms of interpreting what a serious illness should be. Managers should be aware that, at this point, a liberal interpretation must be placed on this definition.\n\n",

These  regulations, along  with  increased  support  for  border  patrol activities, were thought to significantly diminish  the  attractiveness  of  U.S. jobs  for undocumented  workers, thereby  protecting jobs  and  wages  for  legal  workers  in  the United States.\n\nCritics of the IRCA argued that it would encourage  employers  to  engage  in  greater discrimination against U.S. citizens and legal aliens based on their appearance and cultural background, and safeguards against such discrimination  were  included  in  its  content. However, several studies to date have shown that  even  with  these  safeguards  in  place, a\n\npattern  of  discriminating  against  individuals based on physical appearance or accent exists (Phillips and Massey, 1999). Such discrimination includes the denial of jobs as well as paying  lower  wages  to  undocumented  workers. This decrease in pay, below legal minimum, is thought to take place to compensate for the risk  involved  in  being  sanctioned  under  the Act.\n\nThe  IRCA  requires  employers  to  verify the  employment  eligibility  of  all  employees hired by and working for the organization and to  complete  and  maintain  eligibility  paperwork. This paperwork, commonly referred to as I-9  forms, must be maintained on all employees, U.S. citizens as well as aliens authorized to work in the country. The Immigration and  Naturalization  Service  (INS)  is  charged with enforcing the IRCA. However, any number  of  other  federal  agencies, including  the EEOC, the Justice Department, and the Department of Labor, may request a review of the eligibility documentation records of a company. Employers must verify an employee's or applicant's identity and eligibility to work by requesting proof of both within three days of hire. Documents  that  can  be  used  to  verify identity include a state driver's license, state or school I.D. card, and a voter's registration card. Eligibility  to  work  may  be  established using a number of documents including a Social Security card, birth certificate issued by a U.S. state, county, or  municipal  authority, or an unexpired INS employment authorization. Some documents, such as a U.S. passport, establish  both  identity  and  work  eligibility. A complete list of all appropriate documents is provided on the back page of the I-9 form.\n\nAs  mentioned  earlier, the  Act  contains antidiscrimination provisions that are in addition to and do not change discrimination under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act. The\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIRCA bans discrimination against legal aliens or  people  intending  to  become  U.S. citizens. An  alien  has  employment  rights  equal  to  a U.S. citizen, unless  citizenship  is  a  bona  fide occupational  qualification. If  an  alien  is  authorized to work in the United States, an employer cannot give preference to a U.S. citizen who is less qualified.\n\nEmployers  have  several  responsibilities under the law:\n\nIn  order  to  avoid  penalties  under  the IRCA, hospitality  managers  should  use  the following checklist:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe above discussion of these key issues only  scratches  the  surface  of  the  legal  challenges facing hotel HR managers. When you\n\nconsider  that  the  535  members  of  Congress and the members of 50 state legislatures are constantly proposing laws that result in regulation, it is easy to see why HR managers can face daunting tasks in assisting the organization and its managers in staying out of legal trouble.\n\n",

Indeed, humancapital  considerations  top  the  list  of  current managerial concerns in the hospitality industry (Enz, 2001, 38-45). Despite the industry's\n\nconcern with human resources, however, the HR function is oddly disconnected from the line  function. That  disconnect  is  evident  on two primary levels. First, we argue that many business leaders fail to fully consider HR influences when making long-term plans. While most executives acknowledge the importance of  HR  for  implementing  strategic  plans-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'making it happen'-we have seen few who formally incorporate HR concerns when developing a strategic direction. While the predominant  framework  requires  consideration of  HR  strengths  and  weaknesses  during  the strategy-formulation process, HR is primarily viewed as an 'enabling' function, responsible for implementing 'the plan,' and thus largely ignored during the initial planning stages.\n\nSecond, we argue that many HR departments  fail  to  execute  even  the  most  basic functions effectively. Many firms' policies and practices are archaic, inflexible, and do not directly benefit those who are most keenly affected by HR  actions. Based  on those concerns, we  advocate  the  need  for  a  new model of HR-one that should be used as a guide for developing vision, values, and goals, and one that creates a more effective and efficient function for attracting, developing, and retaining quality employees.\n\nTo explain our model, we will first discuss the manner in which HR can contribute to the strategic-planning  process. We  then  present data that demonstrate the link between HR practices and systems on important business objectives. Finally, we  offer  some  ideas  that may  change  the  prevailing  paradigm  and the  operational  role  of  HR  in  hospitality organizations.\n\n",

      "content": "O ur observations are that HR suffers from a negative image in many hospitality organizations and that, sadly, it has earned that negative  image. The  following  views  of  HR  may be  familiar: HR  is  basically  an  employeeadvocate  function  and  represents  the 'soft'\n\nside of the business; HR is a cost center since it does not generate revenue; HR serves as an administrative-support  office  and  organizes the company picnic; and HR is responsible for implementing  strategy, not  developing  strategy.We could go on, but the point is made: human resources  gets  much  lip  service  but  no respect.\n\nOne of the reasons for this negative image  may  be  the  narrow  application  of  the strategic-planning  process  taken  by  many business  leaders. Too  often, the  humanresources function is left out of key planning steps. The  following  comment illustrates  our point. A successful hospitality executive and colleague of ours maintains that his primary function is to determine the vision and direction of the firm, and then it's up to HR and other departments to 'make it happen.' This statement summarizes his views:\n\nHR as a function does not per se have a dedicated  role  in  the  strategic-planning  process. Corporate strategic planning begins with an external assessment of opportunities and threats and  an  internal  assessment  of  firm  strengths and weaknesses. This process is not driven by a function or discipline formula, but rather by an evaluation  designed  to  determine  the  relative importance  and  veracity  of  assumptions  management has made about the industry and the firm. Management  combines  its  fact-based knowledge  with  its  assumptions  and  beliefs about  the  business  it  is  evaluating. Strategic planning, at its core, is the process by which the veracity of these assumptions and the relative importance each has to the overall outcome are revealed. Functional  executives  confound  and corrupt the initial stages of the planning process by becoming caught up in interdisciplinary issues that should be subservient to the strategy process  they  aspire  to  influence. As  such, the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCEO is forced to pull the process of formulating  strategy  away  from  these  executives  and rely more heavily on his or her own judgment or a formal strategy group of executives without discipline responsibilities. 1\n\nIn  this  leader's  view, HR  plays  a  subservient and reactionary role in the businessplanning  process. While  this  is  only  one individual's  perspective, we've  encountered many  who  share  similar  views. We  contend that HR considerations must be taken into account  not  only  during  strategy  implementation, but also during the process of developing that strategy. Indeed, the prevailing models of business planning support this contention.\n\nSeveral approaches can be used to predict a  firm's  competitive  position  and  develop strategic plans. The traditional SWOT model (i.e., strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat)  is  based  on  a  matching  process  such that a firm's strategic direction is based on the fit between external conditions (i.e., opportunities  and  threats)  and  internal  capabilities (i.e., strengths and weaknesses). Based on this assessment  of  fit, leaders  can  then  take  actions intended to achieve a sustained level of competitiveness-for instance, by using internal strengths to exploit external opportunities and taking advantage of opportunities to motivate change and fix internal weaknesses.Another  popular  framework, VRIO  analysis, extends the SWOT model and maintains that competitive advantage is gained by identifying and exploiting the rare, distinctive competencies of the firm (Barney, 1997). The VRIO explanation considers a firm's resources-understood in terms of value, rarity, imitability, and organization-as keys to long-term effectiveness. In simplified terms, value is characterized  by  the  firm's  internal  resources  that can  be  used  to  respond  to  external  threats;\n\nrarity  is  associated  with  the  scarcity  of  such resources  in  the  external  environment; imitability is based on the ability of competitors to acquire, duplicate, or substitute valued resources; and  organization  is  associated  with the firm's structure and systems that are used to extract the greatest degree of value from a given resource.\n\nThese  and  other  models  (e.g., portfolio assessments, competitor ranking) that can be used to analyze strategic positions and develop plans have at least one thing in common: the human element is central to an analysis of internal  strengths, resources, and  capabilities. Technology, in  contrast, is  quite  imitable  and thus should not be considered as a source of competitive  advantage. Human  capabilities, and the social context in which such capabilities are applied, are difficult and perhaps impossible to copy or transfer to settings outside the focal context. While access to capital, relative  market  share, brand  image, and  service quality  are  all  essential  to  a  hospitality  business, such concerns would be largely irrelevant if  the  appropriate  human resources were unavailable. Therefore, while HR may not be the most  important  consideration  during  the strategic-planning  process, this  factor  cannot be ignored when developing long-range plans.\n\n",

      "content": "D espite HR's apparent image problem, it remains  an  essential  function. Much  has  been written  about  the  critical  role  of  HR  for achieving  business  goals  and  objectives, and there  is  a  growing  literature  that  shows  HR policies, practices, and systems are related to a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvariety  of  financial  and  operational  success indicators. 2 Indeed, there is some rather compelling  evidence  that  the  proper  alignment between  HR  systems  and  business  strategy will  enhance  a  firm's  performance. 3 We will complement this literature by presenting two hospitality-specific examples that support the strategic importance of HR for not only implementing long-range plans, but also developing such plans.\n\nExample 1: Compensation and turnover. The 2000 Lodging Compensation and Benefits Survey, conducted by Realtime Hotel Reports  (now  part  of  Smith  Travel  Research) and sponsored by the American Hotel Foundation, provides  direct  evidence  for  the need to consider HR factors throughout the strategic-planning  process. In  addition  to compensation levels and benefits offered by over  2000  hotels, the  survey  also  gathered information about employee turnover. Turnover is a key concern to many hospitality employers. It can be quite costly (Hinkin and Tracey, 2000, 14-21) and has been shown to be related to many important outcomes, including  profitability  (Simons  and  Hinkin, 2001, 65-69). As  such, understanding  HR  policies and practices that can contribute to turnover can lead to more insightful strategic and operational decision-making.\n\nAn analysis  of  the  relationship  between compensation  level  and  total  annual  employee  turnover  (Table  9.1)  yielded  statistically  significant  results  for  the  following positions. 4\n\nWhile  the  magnitude  of  the  correlations demonstrates that a great deal of variance in the  compensation-turnover  relationship  remains unexplained, the data suggest that compensation does have an effect on intentions to stay or leave-a finding supported by related research (Simons and Enz, 1995, 20-27).\n\nTable 9.1 Analysis of the Relationship Between Compensation Level and Total Annual Employee Turnover\n\n",

Complete data for 96 corporate-owned stores were gathered over a 12-month period beginning  in  January  2001. The  primary proposition  was  that  investments  in  training and employee turnover would be significant predictors of net sales. The training variable was  expressed  as  the  number  of  hours  per month dedicated to skill-based programs (e.g., new  employee  training)  and  developmentbased programs (e.g., interpersonal customer service) for line staff. Employee turnover was also measured on a monthly basis (i.e., number of new hires divided by the total number of employees at the end of the month), as was net sales.\n\nAfter accounting for store-specific effects (e.g., location, size)  and  time  effects, the  results  from  regression  analyses  of  the  panel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndata showed that both training and turnover accounted  for  significant  variance  in  store sales. 5 These results  suggest  that  if  sales  are influenced by training and employee turnover, then  long-range  plans  for  growth must consider the consequences of HR decisions  regarding  employee  development  and retention.\n\nThese two examples demonstrate the effects that HR can have on strategic and operational goals. Although  researchers and practitioners have yet to fully understand the process  by  which  the  various  HR  policies, practices, and  systems  might  influence  longrange  effectiveness, the  data  presented  here reinforce the need to consider HR throughout  the  planning  process. However, it's  not enough simply to incorporate HR influences more broadly-the HR function must also be reconsidered. We contend that a holistic and collaborative approach to HR is required, one in which the HR function is closely integrated within the strategic and operational elements of the firm. Thus, HR plays a critical role in designing  structures, facilitating  change, and evaluating  progress. This  objective  requires that  firms  embrace  a  new  model  of  HR  to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage.\n\n",

      "content": "T he traditional role of HR is more appropriately termed 'personnel.' In this role, personnel professionals were responsible for recruiting  and  hiring, compensation-  and benefit-program  design, negotiating  and  administering collective-bargaining agreements, policy  development, personnel  recordkeeping, and  serving  as  a  conduit  for  employee\n\nviews and concerns. Over the years, personnel was renamed human resources, and its role in the  organization  (in  addition  to  its  existing functions) became one of integrating people, policies, and  cultures. To  meet  the  needs  of this  role, HR  practitioners'  responsibilities were  expanded  to  include  communications, training, safety, employee  relations, and recognition and reward programs.Along with those additional responsibilities the HR department became responsible for the organization's legal compliance  in  the  everexpanding area of employment law.\n\nThe  expansion  of  the  HR  function  resulted  from  changes  in  the  way  businesses were managed. One such change was the explosion of mergers and acquisitions in the hotel  and  restaurant  industry. In  the  past  20 years  mergers  and  acquisitions  have  tested HR practitioners' ability to be flexible, detail oriented, and  expeditious  in  both  their  support of other business functions and in the decisions they make related to HR issues. These increases  in  responsibility, occurring  alongside changes in the business, transformed HR professionals  from  generalists  to  specialists. This metamorphosis also fostered the perception-often  promoted  by  HR-that  only 'specialists' could  handle  such  complicated issues. The HR model that emerged was one based on the centralization of knowledge, responsibility, authority, accountability, and control within the HR department.\n\nEven as all this was taking place, however, business  practices  were  changing. As  a  colleague of ours succinctly put it:\n\nAs organizations began to realize that different businesses  needed  and  could  afford  different types of HR programs and benefits, even within the same corporation, HR began to decentralize, replicating the centralized HR structure at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndivision and even business-unit levels. This had the advantage of supporting differentiated HR for each business, but its redundancies cost a lot of  money  and  the  specialist  jobs  got  smaller (i.e., they supported smaller groups of employees) and thus attracted less capable or experienced people. 6\n\nAdded  to  the  complexity  of  this  decentralized  approach  is  the  fact  that  business leaders are under extreme pressure to reduce expenses, increase productivity and revenues, and realign their organizations to become focused  on  core  issues. In  the  last  five  years, these changes have led to enormous pressures being placed on businesses to reevaluate the HR function, its role and responsibilities, and how these  integrate  with  the  rest  of  the  organization. High-performing  organizations today are looking for ways to transfer authority, responsibility, and accountability for HRrelated  transactions  and  decisions  to  line managers and, in some instances, employees. The ramifications of this are enormous. Ironically, we see the most resistance to this change often coming from HR itself.\n\n",

      "content": "T he underlying premise of our model is that all  decision-making  authority, responsibility, and  accountability  should  be  vested  in  the person  who  supervises  the  employee. Thus, decisions related to hiring, promotion or demotion, training, work  actions, 7 pay, and scheduling can and should be made by the immediate supervisor of the affected employee. In many cases actions of this kind do require additional approvals from the company's upper echelons. However, the farther away from\n\nthe  source  that  these  decisions  are  actually made, the  less  likely  it  is  that  real-time  and relevant information about the decision and its outcome will be available for the decision maker. It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the time it takes to complete the decision-making process is extended in direct proportion to the distance it has to travel through an organization's bureaucracy.\n\nOne key  construct  in  our  proposed  HR model is that HR practitioners will no longer make operational decisions, but rather act as consultants to other business functions by designing, developing, and delivering programs that give line managers the tools and training they need to effectively perform their responsibilities. The  following  scenarios  represent common decisions made by HR practitioners.\n\nScenario 1: An employee resigns and the manager needs to fill the vacancy.The process will  probably  include  deciding  whether  the open position can and should be filled, locating  and  interviewing  applicants, determining whom to hire and how much to pay that person, assigning  a  start  date, conducting  training, and  determining  whether  to  retain  the new employee. In the real world the immediate  supervisor  will  know  the  most  about everything relating to those issues and be in the best position to make the most appropriate and timely decisions. The need for direct HR intervention should be minimal.\n\nScenario 2: A service employee is not performing up to expectations in spite of being trained and supervised. The organization has documented policies and practices relating to progressive discipline and the issuance of notification  to  the  employee. The  supervisor should  have  full  authority  to  determine  the need, timing, wording, and level of notice to be  given. While  it's  practical  to  assume  that this type  of  decision  might  require  some\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nadditional  approvals, the  managers  directly related  to  the  employee's  performance  are best  suited  to  understanding  the  issues  and nuances involved.\n\nIn these situations, usually there are policies  and  processes  that  require  the  involvement  of  the  HR  department. Yet  in  most organizations  these  decisions  are  best  made in  a  timely  manner  by  the  individuals  who know the most about the issues. HR specialists should  be  involved  in  this  decisionmaking  process, but  final  decisions  would ultimately be made by individuals outside of the HR function.\n\nOur  model  has  drawbacks, perhaps, but some of that relates to the fact that HR information  is  not  always  shared  with  line  managers. One  drawback  is line managers' potential ignorance of the fine points of HR practice and law.The centralization of the HR function occurred in part because there was a belief that the legal and organizational issues involved  in  making  HR  decisions  were  so complicated that it would not be prudent to trust non-HR supervisors to make them.\n\nMoreover, the  decentralized  model's  redundancies  could  be  costly. Under  the  new HR model the power to make decisions is entrusted to line managers. In this model it is the role of the HR practitioners to assist companies  in  training  managers  how  to  make  and implement  business  decisions  and  then  entrust them with the authority to do so. If such decision-making  power  is  not  distributed  to line managers, they will not gain the necessary skills  to  be  able  to  effectively  perform  their duties. In  contrast, if  line  managers  are  supported in the HR function, the necessary information  will  be  spread  throughout  the organization.\n\nThe examples in Table 9.2 illustrate how HR  practitioners  can  use  the  constructs  of this new model.\n\nThe responsibilities identified in Table 9.2 follow  the  functions  that  are  traditionally found in HR departments. Organizations with centralized HR functions adopt these 'traditional practices' on the theory that they are specialized and should only be conducted by those  who  are  trained  and  skilled. That  approach presupposes that being in HR is the only way to gain that expertise, and further, that this expertise is more important than understanding the operational nuances that exist at  the  line  level. We  suggest  that  HR expertise can be gained by those at the line level more easily than can the nuances of departmental activity be understood by those in HR.The key to transferring these responsibilities  to  the  line  level  is  training  the  supervisors  in  how  best  to  perform  these  duties, providing them with the tools and technology to  effectively  and  efficiently  carry  out  these responsibilities, supporting them with advice, and monitoring their performance. This means that the role of HR changes from gatekeeper  and  decision  maker  to  trainer  and supporter.\n\nAdditionally, management should put in place  strategies  that  reinforce  the  performance of managers who adopt and successfully handle these duties. Indeed, that should be tied to their reviews and total compensation.This is consistent with the goals of (a) the organization to have better-trained and -performing managers, and (b) most HR professionals  to  be  more  of  an  internal  consultant and  strategic  partner  than  mere  arbiters  of proper practice.This new construct allows the line  managers  to  achieve  new  competencies and  control, while  giving  HR  professionals the  chance  to  become  more  of  what  they want to be-and should be. The organization benefits  from  using  this  new  model, because  decisions  are  made  more  quickly  and appropriately, allowing  the  business  to  be\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "New hires attend an orientation conducted by HR, and then they are given some form of on-the-job training.\n\nAs part of the strategic planning and budgeting process, departments should be responsible for determining and justifying staffing levels. Once identified, decisions on whether to fill positions, and with whom, should be left to the department. The role of HR should be to establish suggested sources for obtaining applicants (both internal and external), designing methods for communicating with applicants using those sources, and developing an applicant tracking system. HR should also assist line managers in developing appropriate interviewing methods and materials, train the managers to use them, and monitor the process for legal and policy compliance. Information technology now exists to provide managers with self-service capabilities to find and track applicants. At Bellagio, for example, HR designed a self-service system for applicants, which eliminated the need for data input by HR staff and allowed applicants (both internal and external) to update and monitor their application information and status. These systems are always available and can help reduce the workload of the HR staff.\n\nSalary administration can be managed by line departments through technology, such as the web-based models developed by Melon's HR Solutions group, that provides managers with the data and analytical tools that they need. This gives the responsibility and accountability for these decisions to the departments; HR's role is to provide advice and establish proper control mechanisms to prevent the inexpert (non-specialist) manager from making inappropriate decisions. In this role, HR facilitates the gathering of competitive data and then provides it directly to line managers so they can do their own payroll modeling.\n\nAll new employees attend a general company orientation that is designed by HR and presented by fellow employees. This will give the new hires a peer perspective and help them to develop relationships with other employees. Department and job training should be conducted by a trained trainer from the new employee's department or job. This trainer should have the added responsibility of evaluating the new employee's performance and conducting any retraining that may be required. HR's role should be helping to create the training materials, training the trainers, and implementing a tracking system to allow managers to monitor course attendance and related performance. Park Place Entertainment, for instance, has developed this type of employee development system. The HR department has developed scripts and protocols that serve as templates for all training and development efforts. Line managers are primarily responsible for content, giving them more control over the job- and department-specific training needs. An example of this decentralized approach to development is PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has developed online knowledge management systems that give consultants access to problem solutions that have been identified from prior projects and that may have relevance for current client needs. This type of real-time learning enhances the quality and efficiency of project work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmore  focused  on  its  core  responsibilities  of production and service.\n\n",

      "content": "P ublic and  private  companies  alike  are driven to make effective decisions and to improve performance through expense control and revenue improvement. Over the past 20 years, tools have been developed to help organizations achieve these goals.This trend began  when  financial  departments  discovered online  analytical  processing  (OLAP)  tools that allowed them to collate and query information from all of the disparate files in their databases  and  develop  queries  therefrom. This ad hoc interactive querying capability allowed them to conduct complex multidimensional  analyses  and  more  rapidly  discern issues that needed to be addressed. This practice  provided  a  means  for  organizations  to control  expenses  more  effectively  and  thus improve their bottom lines.\n\nThe  next  challenge  involved  improving revenues  beyond  the  normal  realm  of  sales and  marketing. Those  same  OLAP  tools, when applied to complex and disparate customer  databases, allowed  companies  to  target  their  efforts  and  dollars  in  ways  that maximized  revenue  opportunities. Today, customer-relationship-management  (CRM) systems are helping these companies to better use their resources to satisfy their customers and increase revenues. Much has been written about these practices. For example:\n\nThe  new  cross-departmental  imperative  for companies  in  virtually  all  industries  is  to  empower decision makers to obtain quick answers to their business questions by immediately ac-\n\nquiring the information they need.The effective sharing, distillation, and analysis of information among  such  an  array  of  departments-customer  relationship, sales, product  planning, marketing, and finance, for example-coalesces into  an  enterprise-wide  intelligence  that  is greater than the sum of its informational parts (Liautaud and Hammond, 2001, 5).\n\nAs these practices become perfected, organizations  will  look  for  additional  ways  to improve  performance, and  we  suggest  that HR is the next area to which these might be applied.Adding employee-activity data to the practice  of  interactive  and  multidimensional analyses  will  help  organizations  to  truly  get the  most  out  of  their  human  resources. To gain this capability, human-resources departments in highly successful organizations 'will understand how to use systems and software to  solve  business  problems  and  will  exploit technologies to achieve their business goals' (Boyett, Boyett, Henson, and Spirgi-Hebert, 2001, 28).The decision makers in this instance are the line managers, and the decisions are related to the management of their employees; giving line managers the use of a system like this will increase their access to data and give them the ability to make better decisions. This technology will assist them in converting those data into intelligence. It is expensive to store and maintain all of these data, and 'until it is put in the hands of business users and brings real value to these business users, the value  obtained  from  that  information  does not  compensate  for  the  cost  of  maintaining that  data' (Liautaud  and  Hammond, 2001, 38). While  the  initial  capital  investments  required  to  develop  and  implement  decisionsupport technology may be high, the operational  savings 8 and  improved  decision quality more than justify the investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe appropriate use of technology is critical to the successful transfer of responsibility from  HR  to  the  line  managers  and  departments. The use of business-intelligence technology and tools will enhance line managers' skills and decision-making capabilities by giving  them  the  same  view  that  was  once  reserved for HR staff.Again, the key to this will be the training and support provided by the HR staff.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "W e would be remiss if we didn't offer some thoughts related to the tragic events of September  11, 2001, which  occurred  during  the conceptualization and writing of early drafts of this manuscript. The pressure on management to react to the terrorist acts and their effect  on  the  hospitality  industry  has  been intense. The range of responses to the plunge in  business  levels  was  varied  and  is  not  germane to our discussion. What is important to note is that swift, intelligent, and decisive actions were required in the wake of the attack. That supports the need to adopt new roles for HR and line managers.\n\nA company's ability to adapt to changing conditions  depends  not  only  on  its  policies, but also on the tools that it provides to those responsible for deciding and implementing its strategies. HR departments worked with their management teams to define the strategies to address issues relevant to the attacks and then helped  to  implement  them. Line  managers needed accurate information about business and staffing levels, staff skills and abilities, and financial-modeling  capabilities. Having  HR and  line  managers  in  possession  of  and\n\ntrained to use the most effective tools available will ensure the organization's capacity to meet its needs.This enlightened division of responsibilities  will  result  in  the  most  orderly and informed execution of each group's tasks, and promote teamwork.\n\nIt seems to us that the best part of a line manager's  job  is  having  the  ability  to  make decisions that are most critical for a department's  success. Conversely, the  things  that managers dislike have to do with the HR department's always telling them what to do. In truth, there are probably times when it would be convenient to pass certain responsibilities to  HR, so  that  line  managers  don't  have  to make those decisions or would at least have someone to point to as the culprits. In the end, however, the role of a manager is about responsibility and accountability, and the adage that 'the buck stops here' seems to have been written  with  that  in  mind. The  following  requirements will help line managers feel most comfortable in this role:\n\nIf it is true that our future success both at the business level and as HR practitioners lies in  the  adoption  of  new  ideas  and  technologies, and that leaner, more focused organizations are the ones that succeed, it is imperative  that  this  transition  to  a  new  HR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmodel occur. To assure that the transition is smooth, we will need to learn from others' errors as well as our own mistakes, and we will\n\nneed the steadfast support of the organization in maintaining  this  new  set  of  roles  and responsibilities.\n\n",
