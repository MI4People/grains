      "title": "Dear Reader,",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Congratulations on joining the ever expanding world of hotels worldwide. Your decision to join hotels gives you ample access to global careers. You have chosen that part of hotel operations that maintains the glamour of a hotel. The Housekeeping Department is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance, and aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. The department also maintains the most essential product of a hotel-the rooms . This role of the Housekeeping Department makes it crucial for a hotel as rooms contribute substantially to the revenue of the hotel. For you, as a future housekeeping professional, it is important to adopt the international practices, attitudes, and behaviours that are presented in this book.\n\nMy first book, Hotel Housekeeping Training Manual , has been in print for over two decades now. My readers, by showing their faith in my book, have encouraged me to write this third edition. The basic processes of housekeeping operations worldwide remain still the same as they were two decades ago, and shall not change much in future. However, the application of these processes has changed over the time, largely due to information technology and globalisation. This book attempts to empower housekeeping professionals with the knowledge of these new changes to meet the challenges of the future.\n\nLet us examine some of the changes in travel and hotelkeeping that have emerged recently:\n\nThe guests today are global citizens who travel frequently, thanks to faster transport and better infrastructure. Now, the traveller can choose her/his 'home away from home' from the comfort of her/his home or office by using websites that  take  him  on  virtual  tours  of  hotels  showing  guest  rooms  and  facilities with pricing options to suit all kinds of budgets. Not only this, she/he can also reserve a room for herself/himself as hotels, nowadays, also use websites to make reservations for the customers with the help of Reservation Distribution Systems. Such prior reservations ensure that the guest finds a room booked in her/his name upon her/his arrival in the hotel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe modern traveller, being more aware of housekeeping standards, now expects a certain level of service during her/his stay in the hotel. She/he demands a high degree of cleanliness and sanitation. Now, using Information Technology, the traveller can customise her/his or her requirements on a user-friendly form on the web. The web searches and selects those hotels that meet the specifications given by the traveller, offering him a deluge of options. A woman traveller may want a hair dryer and ironing board in her room while a businessman may want teleconferencing facilities and secretarial services during her/his stay. There are no limits to guests' needs and the web accesses those hotels that attend to these needs at the click of a button. Hence, it has now become essential that the\n\nviii\n\nhousekeeping staff should anticipate and respond to guests' expectations as loyalty of the guests towards the establishment is at stake.\n\nLarge investments in creating opulent hotel spaces have no meaning unless these are maintained in pristine condition in spite of frequent use.\n\nDownsizing is part of the new economic business strategy. Downsizing means the reduction of staff and unprofitable operations to keep overheads to the affordable limit. The result is that fewer people are retained and paid more to increase their productivity. If a room attendant once cleaned 12 rooms in an eight-hour shift which used to increase at the most to 14 rooms, she/he is now normally allocated 16 rooms in a shift. This new standard of 16 rooms per room\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nattendant in a shift has been made possible by equpping the room attendants with better training; efficient equipment; competent supply systems; and a lot more autonomy. They are now required to multitask roles. Similarly, a floor supervisor is no longer only an inspector but is also required to handle guest complaints, and control inventory and budget. Her/his set of skills has become wider and now she/he is expected to show competency in first-aid, fire-drills, report-writing, budgeting, training, motivation, problem-solving, and decision-making. The floor supervisor is now expected to become an intrapreneur (internal entrepreneur). She/he is required to think like an investor and be cost, quality, and productivity conscious.\n\nEmpowerment is the logical consequence of downsizing. Empowerment encourages employees to control their own performance to meet business goals. A floor supervisor has now the authority to provide additional guest amenities and services to regular guests. Executive Housekeepers are now permitted to develop personal rapport with guests by writing letters to them and inviting them to visit the hotel again. The room attendant is also given total control of floor operations and held accountable for the total guest experience. So we see that organisations now, in order to facilitate instant decision-making and following the principle of 'lean is beautiful,' are empowering their staff by equipping them with skills of the managers' profile and by giving them authority to perform tasks earlier executed only by the managers. Hotel personnel have now become knowledge workers as they are equipped with technical knowledge, information, competencies, and skills to execute and fulfil higher responsibilities.\n\nLeasing is another new business strategy and is becoming a way of hotel life. Investors now believe that standalone hotels are unlikely to give the return on investments. A hotel now has to be a part of a community complex with shopping malls, cineplexes, entertainment centres, furnished apartments, convention centre,  and  office  blocks,  all  set  in  spectacular  environments with landscaping and watercourses. The housekeeping role has changed accordingly as a housekeeper is required to act either as consultant to lease holders or to manage housekeeping roles beyond the traditional frontiers of a hotel to include additional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfacilities as maintaining entertainment centres, cineplexes, etc. Housekeeping with its expertise could also become a profit centre earning revenues for the establishment.\n\n",

      "content": "<!-- image -->\n\nRooms Focus: A hotel investor concentrates on room revenues only, which is another form of leasing. She/he likes to increase the number of rooms to distribute overhead costs. Moreover, rooms give a greater contribution to profits. So hotel investors generally like to create one captive all-purpose dining room, or a coffee shop, and bar, in a hotel while leasing other spaces within the hotel's premises to branded restaurants like TGIF, Chillis, etc. This leasing is exercised with strong legal instruments.\n\nFranchised Operations: Hotel  investors  have  seen  the  virtue  of  linking  their  hotels  with internationally  acclaimed  hotel  chain  operations  having  the  muscle  of  economies  of  scale, reputation, professional management, standardised systems and procedures, common advertising budgets, and technical support. This has prompted me to bring in the subject of 'Hotel Chain Associations' in Lesson 2.\n\nInformation Technology has  taken  over  all  the  processing  work. Innovative software and mainframe servers make accurate and productive information quickly available. Reports are churned out by the minute to make operational decision-making respond to daily changes. Most lessons give the role of automation in the sub-spheres of housekeeping operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutsourcing services is another strategy to manage downsizing. Outsourcing means giving the responsibility of certain aspects of operations to external experts and consultants. The obligation of the hotel is to pay a contracted fee and set standards required by the organisation. This has become a way of life in most organisations. Large hotels are outsourcing their housekeeping, accounting, security, horticulture, laundry, food preparation, etc. This is because of the several reasons such as:\n\nThe call for outsourcing has seen the mushrooming of specialist companies like the Housekeeping  &  Maintenance Companies, Security Companies, Landscaping and Horticultural services, Industrial  laundries,  branded  restaurants,  etc. This  in  itself  has  opened  additional  employment opportunities  to  hotel  professionals. These  outsourced  services  have  to  adhere  to  the  hotel policies while retaining their individual identity. All this is established with well-designed legal instruments.  Hiring  the  right  consultants  becomes  important  for  the  hotel  management  but getting the right talent becomes a challenge. I have discussed the roles and competencies of the new housekeeping professional in the 'Introduction' of this book.\n\nYouth will be the future workforce. Mature professionals will have to re-engineer themselves to consider self-employment ( see 'Housekeeping as a Career' in the 'Introduction'). They could either open their own businesses or turn into outsourced specialists. Hotels prefer youth for various reasons:\n\nIn spite of the whirlwind of change, the housekeeping specialist will continue to be there to faithfully create a 'home away from home' for the guest. Gone are the days when a service professional went to a hotel, did her/his job in an eight-hour shift, and returned home. Housekeeping professionals will have to think like an entrepreneur and be empowered to respond to changing business situations and customers constantly ( see the section of the 'Introduction' titled 'The Future Guest').\n\nThis book has been carefully written to serve several segments of the hotel industry. This book, therefore, is ideal for:\n\nReaders, it is time to shed the old coat and wear the new one of this new exciting millennium. I wish all of you the best of luck in your pursuit of becoming the new housekeeping professional. I hope this edition will be your able companion throughout your career.

      "content": "The revolution brought about by cyberspace has changed everything around us, including the traveller. People can now cross boundaries of their country from the comforts of their homes at  the click of a mouse button. This has made them knowledgeable and adventurous. People have moved beyond the political boundaries of their countries to survive in global economies. The movement of people to places like the Middle East, USA, etc. for jobs, has made them more accessible to hard currencies, cultures, cuisines, and customs. Technology has made travel quicker and easier.  The web has shrunk the world into a global village. The housekeeping professional, as a consequence, has been\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npresented with new challenges in the midst of these changes. The new housekeeping professionals should be aware of and sensitive to the changes in attitudes of the guests who come to their hotel.\n\nWoman Power: Women have entered all possible professions-from airline pilots to corporate\n\nexecutives-which were earlier considered to be male territories. Balancing their home and career, they now represent a substantial part of travelling public and expect special attention to be given to their specific needs. They expect hair dryers, ironing facilities, extra security features, privacy, etc. in their rooms. Eating and drinking alone in public bars and restaurants may not be a common custom in many cultures and therefore, women require efficient room service with menus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat suit the diet conscious. Many expect an array of television channels, to keep abreast of their popular soap operas on television, and satellite communication, to keep in touch with their homes.\n\nBusiness Wealth: Private enterprises have reached horizons never imagined before. Worldwide investments and access to big capital funds have fostered big businesses. Giants like the aerospace industry, computer industry, courier services, and credit cards have overtaken oil, automobiles or shipping industries. Individuals too have amassed incredible wealth. Software professionals have become millionaires overnight by creating just one unique software program. The result of this wealth is that business executives and entrepreneurs expect high quality rooms and business services to make an impression of their financial strength on their clients. They expect well-equipped business centres in the hotel and facilities such as secretarial services, videoconferencing, and telecommunication services as never before. In the room, they expect facilities for easy worldwide communications and unobtrusive housekeeping services that keep their rooms clean and sanitised.\n\nEmotional Experiences: Guests have become adventurous. They want total experiences that trigger emotions. A perfect experience is one that appeals to all the senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. The eyes like to see unique costumes, pleasant interior lighting, evidence of cleanliness and\n\nxx\n\nsanitation, and aesthetic room presentations and décor. Guests want their hotel experience to touch their egos, creative tastes, need for adventure, and most of all, their heart. They like to hear silence and touch the softness of bed and bath linen just as much as they want to smell freshness in a room. They may touch the underside of sinks or chest of drawers to ascertain whether there is dust or not. The way the housekeeping staff gives the service, contributes largely to the touching experience. They expect staff to anticipate their needs and respond efficiently to them. Guests\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntoday are very demanding and patronise hotels that recognise their special ways.\n\nTime Conscious: The new guest of this fast-paced world is time conscious and is willing to perform\n\ntasks herself/himself to save on time. Many guests are quite willing to go to the floor pantry to set ice and cold snacks for themselves. They are willing to prepare their own morning tea or coffee in their rooms rather than depend on a slow-paced room service. Guests want speedy responses to their demands for additional blankets or cleaning services so that they can move on with their fast-paced lives. Guests want immediacy and do not tolerate delays.\n\nHealth Conscious: Guests are working hard at keeping fit and healthy. New research has made people aware of benefits of healthy living. As a result, health clubs, gyms, and swimming pools have become popular. Guests have also become nutritionally conscious. This is why health foods have crept into many menus.  Food preferences extend to vegetarian and fat-free dishes. Some want saltless food while others want cholesterol-free preparations. In the room, they need the freshness of a non-smoking room or the sanitisation of drinking glasses or toilet bowls. Many may inspect their bedsheets for stains before sleeping in them or smell their pillow for freshness before laying their head on them. They can sue hotels for unhygienic conditions. Most governments give importance to healthy and hygienic conditions in hotel service areas. Litigations on this count proves to be expensive for the establishment and also leads to bad publicity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nValue-addition: This refers to the extras given for a particular price. For example, business executives may expect a free limousine service from the airport to the hotel, free business lounge services, free newspapers, and even a free breakfast included in the price they are paying for a hotel room; women may want free admission to the sauna and Turkish baths; families may want free baby-sitting services while on their vacations;  guests may want extra pillows or blankets, bathrobes and bath slippers, and vanity supplies like shampoos, moisturisers, shaving creams, and razors in the room. Most quality hotels provide these at the room price only without charging any extra money for them.\n\nInformation: Curiosity has spurred guests to travel which has been made easy by quicker transportation and economy holiday packages. Guests do expect high and authentic standards of service and have no patience for fakes. They want information of the hotel facilities at their fingertips without having to ask anyone. They want access to their room bills on their TV sets to be able to monitor their budgets and expenditures.\n\nD-I-Y Competent: Guests now are willing to do things themselves (D-I-Y stands for Do-it-Yourself). While the western person is normally manually competent, the vast population of oriental people who have migrated to the west, where domestic help is not available,  have also learned to help themselves. Rooms now are fitted with mini-bars, microwave ovens, and tea/coffee stations. Floor\n\n",

They want to make their room reservation from the comfort of their homes and expect it to be honoured when they reach. They want to place their own wake-up calls in automated systems or have access to their bills in the room television monitor.\n\nLanguage Savvy: While English is still the popular language in the global economy, hotels with multi-lingual housekeeping staff are able to attract and deal with multinational clientele.

They shall keep elaborate guest history records to note special needs of the guests in the past, and respond to them whenever these guests will come again in the hotel. Frontline staff will be skilled in handling difficult guests and know exactly what to do in emergency situations.\n\nMultilingual: Frontline personnel will have a good command over the English language. However, the housekeeping professional will also learn other languages such as Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Spanish. Frontline teams will be assembled to provide a range of language options to international clientele. Upcountry establishments will further need skills in local dialects. With multilingual skills, hotel professionals will greatly enhance their job opportunities globally.\n\nService-oriented: The future frontline staff will genuinely enjoy serving people and develop it into an art. They would acquire all the technical, interpersonal, and management skills to give an excellent guest experience. They will use technology to assist them in the process. Guest Histories on common servers will help fine-tune their awareness of guest needs and preferences. Computers will help in speedier service to an ever impatient guest who is perpetually in a hurry.\n\nCreative Problem-solvers: Frontline staff will be skilled in problem-solving and decision-making. Managements will empower them to make on-the-spot decisions to enhance the guest experience. For example, a room attendant may be able to provide a regular guest with an additional vanity set if requested or a second or third service, if demanded.\n\nAction-oriented: Frontline staff of the future will support promises with actions. If a room attendant promises the front office agent a cleared room in twenty minutes for a guest waiting to check in, she will be obliged to honour that time frame. If the floor supervisor promises to provide a baby-sitter to a guest by an allotted time in the evening, she/he will have to fulfill the promise to maintain quality service.\n\nTechno-savvy: Frontline personnel of the future will be comfortable with fast changing technologies and environments that affect them. Software for hotel operations like Fidelio already exists. New recruits from hotel schools will come skilled in operating such software. Training programmes for the housekeeping personnel will focus on how to help them adapt to new changes in procedures and technologies.

Housekeeping professionals can get commissions for repeat guests or they can get bonuses for the good feedback given by guests and the number of times they return to the hotel.\n\nMulti-skilled: Service professionals of future will have management skills, technological skills, customer skills, and reporting skills.

They might have a high level of education and experience to give organisations a leading edge; however, they would do some research and find ways to beat competition with new models of performance. They will act as consultants to the organisation rather than just paid employees.\n\nCreative in Applications: Specialists would not be bureaucratic and rigid in their approach.

For example, new guest history software will require IT specialists, guest relations executive, lobby manager, front office manager, front desk agents, order-takers, housekeepers, telephone operators, etc. They will have to work in teams with each member being a resource to the project. This type of working will require interpersonal skills, negotiation skills, problem-solving skills, listening skills, assertion, and knowledge.\n\nFocus on Continuing Education: Specialists will invest in their self-development from their own pockets.

This is the work of a silent but large workforce called housekeeping . Housekeeping is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance, and aesthetic upkeep of the entire premises-both externally and internally. It is an extension of basic housekeeping multiplied into commercial proportions. Therefore, just as we enjoy keeping a sparkling home, the housekeeping department takes pride in keeping a sparkling hotel to create a 'home away from home.'\n\nThe concept of housekeeping is simplistic but when one considers maintaining a house of several hundreds rooms and numerous public areas, the task becomes gigantic and more complex. It takes a well organised approach and technical understanding to enable housekeeping to cope with the volume of work.\n\nA hotel survives largely on the sale of rooms which contributes a minimum of 50 per cent to revenues. In other words, a hotel's largest margin of profit comes from room sales because a room, once built, can be sold over and over again.\n\nThe room sale depends on the quality of room décor, room facilities, cleanliness of the room, and how safe it is. To make a room appealing to a guest is the task of housekeeping which has to ensure that the basic human needs of comfort and security are present in the room. The personal effort of the housekeeping department has a direct bearing on the guest experience in a hotel. This is achieved by trained staff, specialised equipment and tools, cleaning solutions, and proper systems and procedures.

The provision  of  beverages  is  subject  to  local  customs  and  practices. Therefore, in Europe and America, bars are an important part of hotel facilities, while in Islamic countries, bars may be considered a taboo on religious grounds. The right of admission is reserved in all hotels and many of them display that sign prominently at their doorways or reception. A hotel can refuse accommodation to a guest if he/she is not in a fit and orderly state. With this tradition, hotels have always been a place where visitors and guests always dress their best.\n\n",

These are environment-friendly hotels.\n\nIt  is  believed  that  by  the  year  2050,  residential,  commercial  and  institutional  buildings  will consume as much as 38% of the global energy production by releasing 3,800 megatons of carbon into the atmosphere. This and other similar concerns have led to the emergence of green buildings and green operations concept.\n\nGreen buildings cut down on carbon emission. A green building has the following aspects:\n\nGreen buildings use shaded facades (especially glass), light colours and insulation to make it energy efficient. Research is still ongoing regarding low-energy architecture, hybrid air-conditioning, autonomous energy and water systems, earth construction and community-based design of common property. Green buildings make use of natural lighting and ventilation to maintain a balance between temperature, humidity and oxygen levels.\n\nThe US Green Building Council started the green building movement by creating the Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) rating system. This system encourages efforts towards making buildings clean and energy efficient by implementing steps that will improve the structure's operational efficiency. It focuses on energy and atmosphere, water, green material, education and innovation. In India, the CII-Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre in Hyderabad set the trend and became the model for the construction industry by being the only building in the world to be awarded the 'platinum rating' under this rating system. It was able to save 60% energy and 30% water bills compared to conventional buildings. Since then, the ITC Green Centre has won the Platinum Award and the Grundfos Building in Chennai has won the Gold Award.  A LEED-rated building can prevent 12,000-15,000 tons of carbon per year. Other global-certified bodies are Ecotel, ISO 14001 and Green Globe.\n\nIn India, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) joined hands with the World Business Council for sustainable development to form energy efficiency in buildings. TERI developed the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) rating system to address Indian buildings and environmental conditions. As per this system, the environmental performance of a building over its entire life cycle is evaluated, thereby creating a definitive standard for certifying it as a green building.\n\n",

He entered into the hotel industry in 1940s and expanded it into a $5.3 billion Marriott Corporation with segmented hotel chains such as Marriott Hotels, Residence Inns and Courtyard Hotels.\n\nIn the late 1950s, another new concept emerged-budget hotels. Budget hotels bought cheap land and offered lodging only. They stripped all services like food and beverage, laundry, housekeeping, uniformed services to be able to offer a cheap rate to the travellers. The rooms had no televisions and telephones. Guests sometimes had to rent the bed, linen and blankets for their rooms. The first budget hotel was the Travelodge , Tacoma Washington that grew into a successful chain throughout North America. Travelodge now has added amenities such as TV and telephones and bed linen as essential to stay in the business.\n\nMany other corporations have also spawned into international chains offering the following associations with individual owners:\n\n",

Ignorance of rules is a crime.\n\nGet attention by excellent performance.\n\nClarify problems and doubts openly with the superiors and if not satisfied seek alternate employment.\n\nRebels are those who bring about change. Change can be instituted  through  dialogue  and  cooperation  with superiors and not by rebellion.\n\nNegative  groups  are  counter-productive  to  good performance.

A sound knowledge of accounting reports is essential for an Executive Housekeeper to prepare a budget. For instance, she must know the components of a profit and loss expected statement and how it is presented. It only differs from pure accounting by noting predictions while accounting records actual facts. The housekeeping budget must cover a period that is controllable. Most hotels prepare an annual budget as a reasonable period for control. An interesting feature of the housekeeping department is that while it prepares rooms for sale, the actual revenue reflects in the front-office budget. The Housekeeping Department remains an expense centre and, therefore, mentions costs of maintaining rooms. However, the Housekeeping Budget starts with the expected income and occupancy throughout the year. The expenses of maintaining guest rooms are a relation to the revenues received from these rooms. The accommodations budget, however, is a composite of the front-office revenues and the housekeeping expenses. However, the expenses of housekeeping must factor in anticipated occupancies and should be kept within the revenues generated.\n\nThere are two types of budgets: the capital budget , which is a statement of the expenses covering long-term assets like linen, equipment and furniture that will be used for more than a year and the operating budget , which lays down the anticipated expenses in daily consumables like guest supplies and cleaning supplies to do business on a daily basis.

The moment an employee is hired, the Human Resources Department issues a time card that is maintained at the time office located at the employee entrance at the back of the hotel. This is a single door through which all employees enter and exit the building. The time office (as the name suggests) is where employees register their time-in and time-out. The time office is manned 24 hours of the day by timekeepers in three shifts because the hotel operation is a 24-hour business with employees entering and exiting continuously. Often, the security personnel at the employeegate take over this role as the gate is manned 24 hours by them. The system consists of specially designed cards with columns for the dates, time-in and time-out and maintained in racks at the time office. The timekeeper punches the time through a time-punch machine each time an employee enters or exits the hotel. This is a foolproof method as machines do not lie. Modern technology has introduced electronic time-punch machines that send the data directly to terminals in the accounts, human resources and the housekeeping control desk. Each one of there departments can monitor when an employee has clocked in and out. To make it foolproof, modern timekeeping machines have introduced the thumbprint to record the attendance.\n\nThe registers or time cards are legal documents maintained as per the labour laws and are carefully controlled. While registers are used for a year, time cards are issued each month. The payroll section, located either in the Human Resources Department or the Accounts Department, as per the policy, calculate the salaries and wages given at the end of each month.

Surveys are done to determine what is available in the market in terms of housekeeping requirements; who the reliable suppliers are; the right competitive price for the right quality; volume discounts available for bulk purchase; and lead time of supply and financial strength of the supplier.\n\nEstablishing Par Levels: A par level is the minimum quantity in stores, required to supply an operation daily. These levels are established by experience and past history of consumption. Each store has a par stock of items to ensure that items do not run out, to service the customer.\n\nEstablishing the Lead Time: Lead time is the minimum period required by a supplier to replenish the stock level of a consumer. Each supplier has different time frames to provide items, based on whether the item is custom-made or off-the-shelf; whether it is imported rather than bought domestically; geographic distances of warehouses to the point of supply; and so on. The par stock = the existing quantity +  lead-time quantity. The lead-time quantity would be the amount of stocks consumed from the time of order to the time of supply.\n\nAnticipated Consumption: The amount of anticipated consumption is based on historical data, occupancy levels and level of business. The storage space must match the realistic consumption levels to ensure supplies are in stock.\n\nMonitoring Consumption: It is a key duty of the Executive Housekeeper to keep consumption within budgets. The best is to have a documented system of requisition. It starts with store requisitions which have to be monitored closely. It has to be ensured that the store issues exactly what has been approved by the housekeeper; the items used follow proper procedures of use; the maintenance requests are attended to immediately; there is a system of preventive maintenance for equipment; the staff are properly trained in the use of these assets; and reusable items are carefully stored as prescribed.\n\n",

      "content": "The scheduling of employees of the Housekeeping Department is very demanding and critical as it has a large workforce and the greatest proportion of employee hours to cover. Moreover, unlike the restaurant and bar, which generate revenues that cover employee costs, housekeeping is a cost centre. Revenue centres can afford to add employees as the potential for revenue increases. Housekeeping does not have this flexibility. Each employee added has to justify the cost of such addition. The Housekeeping Department is very visible to guests and any deficiency in standards of housekeeping is immediately noticed. The Executive Housekeeper is challenged to ensure the right mix of employees that uphold the tasks of keeping a clean house to the highest standards.\n\nThe housekeeping department has an elaborate employee structure depending on the size of hotel. (See Lesson 6, 'Organisation of the Housekeeping Department' for more details.) Employee scheduling ensures employee presence and satisfies the following requirements:\n\nEvery schedule is authorised by the Executive Housekeeper and ensures optimal deployment to ensure that peak hours are fully serviced with competent employees. Busy hotels like downtown hotels, business hotels or airport hotels run a 24 7 operation and have morning, afternoon, and night shifts. The simplest way to schedule employees is given below:\n\nOne observes that each employee gets a day off in the week. A reliever position is created to substitute the employee on leave on a particular day.\n\n",

The Executive Housekeeper should identify Key Result Areas (KRAs) for each job position. KRAs make a difference to the operation. It could be in terms of cost savings; customer satisfaction; maintaining housekeeping standards; productivity; teamwork; new ideas to do things better; punctuality and attendance, and so on. Typically, the KRAs are discussed before a budget year and the performance towards them noted for review in every quarter of that year and finally at the end of the year. The KRA objectives must follow the SMART principle (i.e., S pecific, M easureable, A chievable, R ealistic, T ime). The end of the year rewards are linked to the achievement in terms of bonus, increment, and recognition. Normally, the appraisal system cascades down where immediate supervisors first fill the appraisal form after a discussion at an appraisal interview. The completed form is sent to the next higher authority (e.g. Assistant Housekeeper) for a second opinion and finally to the Executive Housekeeper who assesses the rewards to each employee based on her budgets and finally sends it to the HR Department for processing.\n\n",

Obviously the guest cannot be disturbed and therefore, one is not able to verify the occupancy status of the room.\n\nLuggage in Room but not Used: This code may seem odd. There are guests who may lease a room but stay with friends and relatives in the city. The luggage is not opened and the bed is not used. The danger is that the guest may have skipped without paying the room bill and has left the baggage as a decoy.\n\nUnder Repair: Indicates that the room is declared unsuitable for occupancy till repairs in the room are set right. This is a temporary situation where the room can be released in a short time.\n\nOccupied, but no Luggage: These rooms show that the beds and bath linen have been used in spite of no guest luggage. There are several possibilities in such rooms:\n\nScanty Baggage: A room with light luggage. This can be a potential skipper (a person who may depart without paying the bill).\n\nOut-of-Order: A room on a long-term maintenance requirement and therefore, unsuitable for sale.\n\nDouble Lock: A double lock is a security feature that cannot be opened with a master key.

But the situation becomes critical when there are unusual pets like a boa constrictor (a species of snake), crocodile or a monkey!\n\nDrugs: Illegal items like drugs in rooms are a serious criminal matter. Tell-tale signs of drugs are syringes, odd smell in the room, small burners, pouches of white powder, and so on.\n\n103\n\nArms: In a world engulfed with terrorism, the presence of arms, bombs and explosive materials is dangerous. Such matters need to be reported immediately.\n\nGambling: Generally, gambling is an illegal pursuit unless establishments like casinos have licences for such activities. Rooms showing evidence of gambling is a reportable matter and requires security interventions.\n\nTheft: Housekeeping personnel are additional 'security eyes' of the property. Housekeeping personnel on floors come into contact with the private aspects of a guests stay. Floor supervisors and room attendants are trained to look out for missing hotel property in rooms. Normal things that go missing are wall pictures, bathrobes, towels, bathroom slippers and clothes hangers. Hotels permit guests often to take away vanity sets in bathrooms, soaps, stationery, matchboxes, and laundry bags. However, floor personnel should remain aware of missing items in a room and should report the matter to the control desk.\n\nDamage: The above-mentioned principles would also apply to damaged hotel property. The hotel authority has the right to recover amounts for damages to hotel property.\n\nMedical Emergency: Medical emergencies of guests are another serious issue which is to be attended. Guests can be threatened by medical conditions any time such as heart attack, allergic attacks, and so on.  The hotel personnel must take into consideration such things and provide aid when such medical emergencies arise.\n\nChildren: Kids left unattended in a guest room sometimes pose as a risk. A room attendant does not leave the room till the parent or guardian is located and brought back.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The Linen Room usually serves as the base of all operations for most of the housekeeping departments. It is usually under the control of a Supervisor, who has the responsibilities to issue fresh linen and receive soiled ones. A linen room could also have a dedicated linen store which keeps a stock of new linen to replenish those which are in circulation when they are lost or damaged. The amount of linen maintained is based on the size of the property. For example, linen investment is going to be enormous when one considers the volume of linen to be used in a hotel. The amount of linen is based on the total number of linen required to equip all rooms and restaurants in one time. This is considered as linen in circulation. This par is multiplied keeping in mind the time required to launder the soiled linen. An in-house laundry should take about 24 hours to launder a set of linen while outsourced laundries may take upto 48 hours. Keeping this in mind large hotels will have to\n\nmaintain a turnaround par stock of five:\n\n1 round in use (circulation in guest rooms)\n\n1 round in the floor linen room and maid's cart\n\n1 round in the laundry\n\n1 round in the linen room\n\n1 round in the linen store (optional)\n\nIt is quite normal for a small hotel to have a round of four. Anything less may pose a challenge for the housekeeper.\n\nEvery hotel has its own policy regarding the change of bed linen. Deluxe properties may want to change used bed linen everyday. Economy properties may change linen every alternate day or every\n\nthree days. Eco-hotels encourage guests to use linen longer to conserve energy and resources. In any case a room cleared for sale to a new guest will always have fresh linen. The Floor Supervisor will ensure that the hotel policy is carefully implemented.\n\nThe typical linen requirement for a twin room would translate as 4 single bed sheets, 2 night spreads, 4 pillow covers, 2 blankets, 2 bed covers, 2 bath towels, 2 face towels, 2 hand towels and 1 bath mat.\n\nThe challenge for the linen supervisor increases if the property uses different coloured restaurant linen for each restaurant outlet. Each colour will need its own par stocks. While it is prudent for all hotels to use white linen, interior design concepts may insist on coloured linen, especially in specialty restaurants.\n\nLinen rooms are of two types: (i) centralised ones where all linen is controlled at a central point. Such linen rooms are found at resorts which may have a few rooms only to justify centralisation; (ii) decentralised ones where the main linen room feeds floor pantries which maintain linen par stocks to service a set of rooms. This system is ideal for large buildings, especially high rise ones, which have several floors or such buildings which are too spread out for a centralised linen room e.g. resorts with chalets spread over large acreages that require feeder linen rooms to reach the remote points. These floor pantries are controlled by Floor Supervisors.\n\nFigure 17.1 gives a typical layout of a linen room. It should be observed that the linen room has only one entrance for security reasons and it adjoins the in-house laundry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLayout of a Linen Room\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "A public area, in hotel parlance, is a common space and facility accessible to resident guests and the local populace to meet, transact business and socialise. Broadly speaking, the public areas would include (a) ' front of the house ' areas such as porches, lobbies, front offices, management offices, and public washrooms; (b) ' revenue areas ' such as restaurants, health club, banquets, beauty salon, shopping arcade, business centre, cyber café, bars, lounges, gymnasium and guest rooms; (c) ' recreation areas ' such as swimming pools, sports courts, beaches, landscaped gardens, etc.; and (d) ' convenience areas ' such as bank, post office, convenience store, travel desk, guest relations,\n\nfoyers,  elevators,  corridors,  car  parks  (open air  and  basements),  fire-escapes,  public  stair wells. All these areas must be well maintained, cleaned and kept in order at all times as they are open to guest view. Such activity has to be done discretely and safely with minimum disturbance and exposure to guests. It is for this reason that most public area cleaning is done at night when there is least public traffic in the hotel.\n\nThere are certain considerations, at the outset, by the investor when creating public areas:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe local building authorities also insist on a minimum ratio of empty space outside in relation to building space.\n\nThe complexity of hotel public areas increases if the hotel has its own private beach or independent chalets spread over large acreages. All surfaces have their own unique properties that need technical understanding to maintain. For example, driveways and car parks are made of tar; beaches of sand; pathways of stones; landscapes with gardens, golf courses and tennis courts with lawn; swimming pools, waterfalls, rockeries and fountains that have their own cleaning challenges with water; and hotel facades that get more difficult as the architecture is complex.\n\n",

The types of soil vary as follows:\n\nDust refers to general particles of loose sand which float in the air and at many times not visible. It is easily cleaned by dusting with dry cloth, feather duster or brush and dust pan.\n\nDirt refers to clumps of dust caused by moisture, grease or tar. Dirt also includes organic substances like dead foliage, excreta, etc. The feature of dirt is that it sticks to the surface and therefore requires an abrasive movement to dislodge it along with a cleaning agent.\n\nLitter refers to loose rubbish things found in areas where there is human activity, e.g. waste paper in  offices,  discarded  vegetable  and  meat  trimmings  in  kitchens,  empty  bottles  and  cellophane packets in public areas, etc.\n\nStains on a surface are caused by an external element such as acids, dyes, paints, chemicals, alkali, etc. Fresh stains can be absorbed with powder, or dissolved by the use of apt chemicals such as alkaline cleaners to neutralise stains caused by acids.\n\nDiscolouration is caused by exposure to moist air. Metals are prone to this phenomenon, e.g. iron gets rusted, silver and brass darkens and copper gets green. All metals have their respective polishes to bring them to their original sheen.\n\n",

This is in addition to furniture, artefacts, landscapes, etc. that they have to clean and maintain.\n\nDusting: A basic dry method, manually using a feather duster or soft lint cloth. A variant is dustmopping, using a dry mop.\n\nDamp-dusting: A wet method, manually using a cloth and neutral solution for dirt.\n\nSweeping: A dry method for removing dust from floors with brooms. Carpeted areas requiring spot cleaning will need a brush and dust pan.\n\nSpot mopping: It is to remove wet spills of liquid of any type at a local spot as well as to avoid stains developing on the floor surface. A variant is spot cleaning which is a manual method to remove isolated stains with an appropriate stain-removal agent. This is used especially removing stains on upholstery, drapery, carpets and other flooring.\n\nWet mopping: A wet method, using a damp mop on a floor surface done only after the surface has been dry dusted.\n\nVacuum cleaning: A dry method, especially on carpeted surfaces, using a vacuum cleaner that employs an electro-mechanical suction to remove dust.\n\nWet vacuum cleaning: A wet method of cleaning large wet surfaces, using the same electromechanical suction processes.\n\nBuffing: It  is  a  wet  electro-mechanical  method  where  a  buffer  machine  with  pads  or  brushes restores dull floors like granite or marble to its original sheen with friction facilitated by a spray of an appropriate detergent.\n\nFloor polishing: It is a dry electro-mechanical method, using a floor machine with a speed of 175-1500 rpm to floors which are first dusted and applied with the appropriate polish to restore the floor to its original sheen.\n\nScrubbing: It is a wet method using light or heavy scrubbing machine (based on the floor soilage) that uses pads or brushes to scuff deeply embedded dirt in floors. The machine sprays detergent according to pH potency required to make the process of scrubbing efficient. A variant is manual scrubbing for smaller surface areas like mirrors or glass using a detergent spray and a cloth. The surface is dried with a squeegee.\n\nBurnishing: A dry mechanical method, using a high speed burnishing floor machine which uses friction and heat to restore gloss to surfaces like marble, granite and slate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStripping: A method of removing old floor finishes like tiles or wood and the seal that binds it to the floor, to reveal the raw floor for refinishing.\n\n",

These are:\n\nSome examples of such equipment are given below.\n\nFlex Neck Broom Yard Brooms are used for sweeping external surfaces like the driveways, walkways, porch, car parks, employee' entrance, receiving apron, rooftops and all other tarred and cemented floor areas. Public area cleaners use these brooms for removing dead foliage, mud and cigarette butts from these areas.\n\nSweeping Brooms are  used  for  cleaning  internal  floors  prior  to subjecting them to water cleaning. The typical surfaces would be found in uncarpeted corridors like in the basements or public corridors found in shopping arcades and lobbies. The brooms remove the grime and mud from the surfaces that are swept into dustpans and deposited to common garbage areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMops are  meant to be moistened in pails of water before being applied on the floors. Public floors with tiles, marble, granite, terrazzo and linoleum are best cleaned with this method.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFloor Dusters are used to wipe out dust only.

Public cloak rooms, service landings and stairwells are subject to this treatment. Squeegees have rubber endings that collect water with the sweep and diverted to drains.\n\nCotton Mops are used when adequate drainage is not provided. These mops absorb the water and are then squeezed out into pails.\n\nFloor Scrubbers are used for wiping difficult stains and spots on floors.\n\nFeather Dusters are  useful  tools  for  cleaning public area tables, lamp shades, sofas and artefacts that are at floor level or on walls. Feather dusters are light and do not scratch surfaces of delicate materials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHand Brush and Dustpan is the common tool that all public cleaners will like to have to remove dirt from table tops, carpets or hard floors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBuckets or pails are essential to any wet cleaning of surfaces.\n\nSponges are handy for all surfaces to clean and scrub difficult stains and spots.

Here are some tips in the use of vacuum cleaners.\n\nA dustette is a small, light vacuum cleaner used for cleaning curtains, upholstery and mattresses. It cleans by brush and suction and is very easy to handle.\n\nWet Vacuums: This vacuum sucks water from floors or can both suck and spray water to rinse the soiled area. Squeegee attachments on wet vacuums can make floor clean-up, stripping and scrubbing more efficient. Wet vacuums come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some canister models can be dragged on castors while others can be strapped on the back of the cleaner. These vacuums have collection tanks that store the water that has been sucked up from the floors. This equipment can be used on wet carpets as well. Some wet vacuums\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmay be pushed like a cart and are heavier for large water suction needs off floors.\n\nWet Extractors: While wet vacuum cleaners have a suction feature, wet extractors have suction and water injection features. With this, they simultaneously rinse and suck water from the surface.\n\nThey are best for both carpets and floors. The basic principle of operation is that the extractor sprays water and detergent onto the surface and then uses suction to extract the water into tanks built into the wet extractor. Some machines have agitators before spraying to loosen the dirt from the carpet. They have other attachments for draperies and upholstery as well. Wet extractors come in various shapes and sizes. They come in lighter portable tank versions, as well as the heavy duty push-cart variety. They can be used for both floors and carpets. Some extractors can also have a feature for dry pick-up like normal vacuum cleaners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

The housekeeper must make sure at the time of purchase that the window fabrics can be maintained easily and inexpensively. Some fabrics do not respond well to washing, spotting or vacuuming. These need to be tested before they are subject to such treatment. Drapes can fade, bleed of colour, or shrink. The best fabrics chosen for hotels are those that can be washed. Nowadays windows are lined with cotton fabric to save them from exposure to sunlight resulting in the fabric becoming brittle or losing colour. Linings must be pre-shrunk before they are sewn onto curtains.

      "content": "The main objective of carpet cleaning is to give carpets a long life. Since this one item is so expensive, it is treated as an asset that deserves a special care. Housekeepers are advised to have an annual carpet maintenance programme. Such a programme will have the following elements:\n\nCarpet cleaning is done by several methods:\n\nDry Vacuuming Method: The vacuum cleaner is the principle machine for cleaning carpets as it lifts piles, levels them in one movement, and sucks dust completely. Some modern vacuum cleaners have a 'combination floor nozzle' that cleans floors as well as carpets at the drop of a switch. Whenever one uses the nozzle for carpets, move against the pile first and then along with the pile to remove hidden soil lodged inside the carpet piles. Use smooth brisk movements with downward pressure for smoothening and positioning the piles. Take care to empty out the vacuum cleaner dust bag often, avoid dust congestion in the bag. Congestion stops the suction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHot Water Extraction: Hot water extraction is sometimes referred to as 'steam cleaning'. Actually this is a misnomer as real steam on carpets is too dry and hot to clean the carpet properly. In this method, spray hot cleaning solution under pressure onto the carpet and immediately extract with a vacuum source. Flush the dirty solution, collected in a recovery tank, into the waste water system of the hotel. The advantage of this method is that it has the ability to flush out large amounts of contaminants in the carpet. It is the most preferred method and has the deepest cleaning action most suited to carpets with thick piles.\n\nShampooing: This method involves wetting the carpet and shampooing it. The equipment used is a motorised circular brush that injects cleaning solution at pressure into carpets that loosen and\n\n",

      "content": "Bonnet Method (Dry-Cleaning): This method is another wet cleaning method with a difference. It injects the cleaning solution mist into the carpet in the form of a spray and allowed to soak for a short while. It is then buffed with a rotary machine with absorbent pad that agitates the surface of the pile. Pads are made of synthetic or natural fibres and can be laundered and re-used. The method has the advantage of drying very quickly because of less moisture used. It generally cleans well the top one-third of the carpet visible to the naked eye. But it does very little to the grit and sand lodged deep in the pile that damage the carpet over time. Because there is no flushing action or extraction, there is very little deep cleaning involved. This method may be considered as an interim cleaning between more effective methods.\n\nDry Foam Method: This method is similar to shampooing where the brushing action is aggressive, with counter rotating cylindrical brushes. The method uses a high foam shampoo detergent with less liquid. It is applied by a rotary machine with a brush that suspends soils and emulsifies oils. The resultant liquid on the carpet is sucked out by a wet vacuum cleaner. Like shampooing it is not a suitable method for thick pile carpets.\n\nManual Method: This is a method using the carpet brush and dustpan. It is recommended to brush against the piles to make them stand. This gives a springy feeling when one treads on them. Use brisk movements between piles to scoop out dust. Collect the dust in dustpans and empty it in garbage bags after every room. Carpet brushing is preferred to noisy vacuum cleaners to avoid disturbance to sleeping guests especially in the night and early mornings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDry Powder Cleaning Method: In this method dry powder or crystals are sprinkled on the carpet and worked into the pile with a hand brush. The powder absorbs soils which are later removed by vacuuming the carpet surface. This method is ideal for high traffic areas that cannot be obstructed for long.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

      "content": "While water is the king among liquid cleaning agents, we discuss here a few other traditional liquid cleaning agents that are either diluted in a little water or used directly with a dry cloth.\n\nAmmonia is an alkali made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen. It is highly soluble and forms a solution called ammonium hydroxide (liquid ammonia). It is not too active when dry, but reacts with many chemicals in liquid form. It softens hard water and emulsifies grease.\n\nAcetone is a volatile and inflammable liquid. It can damage most plastics. It is effective in removing paint stains, dyes and cosmetic smudges. It is recommended to do spot testing before full use to ascertain whether the surface will get damaged.\n\nBenzene is a distillate of coal tar. It dissolves grease as well as paint and tar stains. It exudes powerful fumes and, therefore, is harmful for use. Protective masks are necessary.\n\nMethylated spirits are derived from methanol-a type of alcohol used for industrial purposes. It is also called methyl alcohol or wood alcohol. It is flammable and highly poisonous. It has to be handled with extreme care. It reacts with various substances and is effective against grease stains.\n\nMethalene chloride is a volatile liquid with a strong odour. It requires protective clothes and masks when in use. It is ideal for stripping sealants and paints as it possesses a strong solvent.\n\nParaffin is a white, partly clear, waxy solid that has no odour or taste. Paraffin forms a moisture proof film on surfaces. It is also grease solvent.\n\nTurpentine is a colourless liquid with a strong odour. It is highly inflammable. It is used as a thinner for paints and varnishes. As a cleaning agent it is a grease and paint solvent ideal for removing paint and grease stains.\n\nVinegar is a sour liquid derived from wine-making. The French call it sour wine. While vinegar's use in food preservation and salads is well known, its commercial use has found its way to housekeeping cleaning chores. It acts as a mild acid unaffected by hard water and useful in removing light stains in baths.\n\nWhite Spirit and Tetrachloroethylene are volatile liquids with the former being inflammable, used for spot cleaning to remove stains of wax, oils, fats, tar and rubber and resins. It cannot be used on PVC, rubber, plastic, thermoplastics and asphalt.\n\n",

Nylon scourers are made to have an abrasive effect and yet prove less damaging to surfaces. Primarily, the abrasive used is based on the type of surface and the stubbornness of the dirt or stain. Fine abrasives like jewellers rouge are used for delicate artefacts and equipment; medium abrasives are used for ceramics or china-based items; while stronger hard abrasives like steel wool, emerypaper and sandpaper are used on surfaces that have a higher resistance to getting scratched like stainless steel sinks, metal drainpipes, etc. Abrasives are normally used manually.\n\n",

Non-selective pesticides should be used only when no other method of control is available.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver time certain pests like rats and mosquitoes have developed a resistance to pesticides. Manufacturers are producing new chemicals and methods to control them. For example, cockroach eradicators know the exact crevices and cracks where cockroaches breed and are able to inject a smart gel with a syringe in those areas. Smart gel is an odourless cockroach control treatment that does not require vacation of the premises as done in messy fumigation. Cockroaches get attracted to the gel, eat it and die. Similarly, termi-freeze is a chemical (Imidacloprid) treatment for termites. Contractors bore holes in the junctions of walls and pillars and inject this chemical. Termites which can travel upwards to several floors are trapped by these chemicals.\n\n",

      "content": "The most effective and safe method of executing a pest control programme is by employing wellqualified professional exterminators on a contract basis. The contract is based on the layout of the property, the area to be covered and complexity of the problem. For example, project sites will have greater challenges as large areas are exposed to the elements. The housekeeping department is reposed with the responsibility of ensuring the pest control programme. Pest control schedules have to be carefully planned as those areas are cordoned of for hours to have the desired effect. For\n\nexample, guest rooms are fumigated every month while food and beverage areas have their own convenient schedules. Areas that need special attention are floor pantries, non-food stores, linen rooms, locker rooms, cafeteria and garbage areas. The engineering department is co-opted to access drains and gutters. Modern pest control methods include non-pervasive items that do not require the closing down of facilities. Professional pest-control contractors know the habits of various pests and are able to isolate breeding grounds and capture them there.\n\nHowever, pest control contractors cannot be expected to maintain the premises absolutely insectfree without the supplemental support and assistance of hotel personnel. One of the methods of a pest control programme is prevention . By studying the habits of targeted pests, one can ensure adequate measure to avoid attracting them. For example, ants, cockroaches and mice look for food. If food areas are sanitised properly after operations, it is unlikely to attract the pests. Similarly, termites attack wood. Therefore, furniture needs to be treated with anti-termite chemicals to prevent termites from damaging the woodwork.\n\nThe residual insecticides necessary for a successful campaign against these insects are relatively toxic and must be handled with great care. It is recommended that they be used only by professional exterminators unless the hotel has in its employment an individual who is trained in their use. They must also be stored in special areas away from human contact and food.\n\nCleanliness and constant vigilance, particularly in handling food, refuse and garbage is the best defence against rodents. All containers of these items should be clean and tightly covered and should be in metal. Wire enclosures should be used for dry food stuffs in cartons and bags. This procedure plus periodic campaigns by the contract exterminators should keep the hotel free of rats and mice.\n\nOutdoor areas are more susceptible to pests than indoor areas. Therefore, one has to determine the acceptable level pests in outdoor locations. A programme of suppression of pests limits the pests as they cannot be completely eradicated.\n\nFor this reason, it is recommended that all maids carry insecticide sprays on their carts and use them routinely when cleaning guest rooms and terraces. Recommended insecticides are harmless to human beings and animals, but it should be kept away from food stuffs. These insecticides do not have a residual life and are, therefore, effective against a great many crawling insects, cockroaches in particular, on direct contact.\n\n",

Generally, the source of this kind of an odour is rancidity. This class of odour is least problematic and can be dealt with refresheners.\n\nSulphur compounds: These odours are generally formed of organic sulphite and mercaptan. They are caused by sources like anaerobic reactions, rotten zucchini and similar plants, decay of dead bodies.\n\nNitrogen compounds: These odours are generally caused by amines. Practically they are generated from rotten fish, dead bodies, urine and etc. sources.\n\nBesides the above classification of odours, in some rare cases the nitrogen in the reactive part of some of the odour molecules is replaced by phosphor and the sulphur is replaced by selenium. In such cases the odour is even stronger and irresistible.\n\nThe table below describes the chemicals that cause a type of odour.\n\nIn practice, a foul odour is formed by a combination of sulphur and nitrogen molecules making the odour complex, requiring multiple treatments to eliminate it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

These fragrances act like a jammer for the foul odour and in a meaning, confuse the message sent to the receptors in nose by the foul odour. This makes a polishing effect by preventing the perception of the foul odour.\n\nSettling: Odour control uses misting systems, the mist created captures the foul odour molecules and slowly settles down. With this effect very similar to the effect of rain in the atmosphere, air is washed by a mixture of water having a fantastic odour control.\n\nBreakdown: Enzymes bacterial and other components in the formula of certain types of odour control formula completely break down the odour molecule.\n\nAs the result of three actions and combinations of them, foul odours are degraded below the perceptible level for human being.\n\n",

Even cotton and linen will be weakened, if allowed to soak in a bleach solution for too long. Chlorine bleach should not be used on silk, wool, or fabrics exposed to sunlight (curtains, for example). It is recommended to always pretest bleach on a hidden area and rinse all bleached items thoroughly as a precaution to damaging fabric. Chlorine bleach is poisonous. It causes burns and irritation, if it comes in contact with the skin or eyes. Read all warnings on the label. Never mix chlorine bleach with other cleaning substances, especially ammonia, as this will release chloramine, a highly toxic substance. Sodium perborate is sold in crystal form.

Although considered safe for all fibres and harmless to dyes, it should be tested on an inconspicuous area of fabric before use. It must be handled carefully, as sodium thiosulphate can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, lungs and digestive tract. Turpentine is commonly used as a thinner for oil-based paints. It is effective on paint and grease stains, but it must be used carefully. Turpentine is flammable and poisonous and, therefore, the user must observe all label precautions. White Vinegar is used for stain removal. Cider and wine vinegar have colour that can leave a stain. Vinegar should be diluted before use on cotton or linen. Vinegar is safe for all other colourfast fibres but can change the colour of some dyes. It\n\nis recommended to always test its effects on an inconspicuous area first. If a dye changes colour, rinse the affected area with water and add a few drops of ammonia. Rinse thoroughly with water again. Glycerine is used in the preparation of the wet spotter, which is used to remove many kinds of stains. Amyl Acetate (banana oil) is used in stain removal. It is safe for use on fibres that could be damaged by acetone, but it should not be allowed to come in contact with plastics or furniture finishes. Amyl acetate is poisonous and flammable. Avoid contact with the skin and inhaling the vapours.\n\nAmmonia is used for stain removal. Because ammonia affects some dyes, it is recommended to pre-test on a hidden corner of the stained article. To restore colour changed by ammonia, rinse the affected area with water and apply a few drops of white vinegar. Rinse with clear water again. Ammonia damages silk and wool. If it has to be used for these fibres, dilute ammonia with an equal amount of water and use as sparingly as possible. Ammonia is poisonous. Avoid inhaling its fumes. It will cause burns or irritation, if it comes in contact with the skin or eyes. Observe all label precautions. Never mix ammonia with chlorine bleach, as this will release chloramine, a highly toxic substance. Alcohol: The common isopropyl alcohol (70%) is sufficient for most stain-removal jobs that call for alcohol, although the stronger denatured alcohol (90%) can also be used. Alcohol with added colour or fragrance should not be used. Alcohol will fade some dyes, therefore, a pre-test is recommended. Alcohol will damage acetate, tri-acetate, modacrylic, and acrylic fibres.

Some are rugged like the dungarees of gardeners, kitchen stewarding utility workers and engineering mechanics, while others are dainty for receptionists, restaurant hostesses, waitresses, etc. Without some knowledge of textiles, the housekeeper is handicapped when purchasing and maintaining them. She will have to rely on whatever the manufacturers tell her.\n\nFirst let us understand some fundamental terms. The words 'fabric' and 'cloth' are used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as synonymous to 'textile'. However, the housekeeper must know their subtle differences. 'Textile' refers to any material made of interlacing fibres. 'Fabric' refers to any material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding (all explained later) that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.). Cloth may be used synonymously with fabric, but often refers to a finished piece of fabric used for a specific purpose (e.g. tablecloth). In order to understand textiles, we have to know what makes it. A textile is made up of strands of fibres. Fibres are the raw materials for all textiles. Fibres come from nature through animal, plant and mineral strands. Fibres are collected, sorted and then twisted to form a yarn. Yarns are interlaced (woven) together to form a textile. Most natural fibres used for textile production measure ½ to 8 inches. Such short fibres are called staple fibres . Modern technology has developed synthetic fibres that are produced in continuous lengths and are called filaments . There are two kinds of fibres: natural fibres and man-made fibres (from natural sources).\n\n",

Worsted yarns are commonly used for warm clothing. All finer quality of fabrics is made of worsted yarns; and (2) Woollen yarns are bulkier produced from carded, non-parallel fibre. Woollen yarns have small fibres. Woollen yarns are used for making carpets, blankets and felts. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing.\n\nThe wool is sheared from sheep, sorted, washed and dried; oil is applied and the fibres are combed so that they lie parallel to each other. From here the yarns are spun. Wool provides warm,\n\ncomfortable fabrics for dresses, suits and cardigans. Some members of the camel and goat family also produce wool. The pashmina wool of the Afghanistan goat is the rarest fibre of them producing the finest shawls, carpets and rugs. Other animal textiles are made from hair or fur such as alpaca wool, vicuña wool, llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings. Angora refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the Angora rabbit. Cashmere, the hair of the Indian Cashmere goat, and mohair, the hair of the North African Angora goat, are types of wool known for their softness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSilk is derived from caterpillars. These worms form a cocoon or nest around themselves with the saliva from their mouths. They lie in the cocoon and change into butterflies, break their cocoon, lay their eggs on leaves and die. Silk is divided into two kinds-cultivated silk and wild or Tussar silk. Cultivated silk is derived when the butterflies are killed inside the cocoon and after de-gunning the cocoon, the yarns are stretched out. This is the only fibre in nature which comes in the yarn form with 200 metres to 400 metres in length. The wild silk is derived from broken cocoons and yarn is 2' to 21' long. All finer qualities of fabric are produced from the cultivated silk and the thicker ones from wild silk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

As earlier mentioned all long fibres make finer and thinner yarns and hence the quality of the fabric depends on the quality of fibres used in yarns. The strength and beauty of linen produced from flax fibres have made it a popular fabric for fine table cloths, napkins and handkerchiefs.\n\nSince cotton is a major textile used in hotel operations, it is beneficial to understand the preparation process of cotton to yarn.\n\nOpening and Cleaning Raw cotton comes to cotton mills in 500 pound (125 kg) bales. The cotton is put through an opener machine to fluff it and separate any residual cotton seeds. It is then beaten through a picker machine to beat the cotton and dislodge the seeds. It is sieved using a fan to reach a fluffy consistency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarding The cotton from the picking machine comes out in sheets or 'laps' and fed into a caring machine consisting of rollers with fine teeth. The cotton leaves the carding machine in large ropes of fibre.\n\nNote: In  a  wider  sense,  carding  can  refer  to  these  four  processes: willowing-loosening the fibres; lapping-removing the dust to create a flat sheet or lap of cotton; carding-combing the tangled lap into a thick rope of 1/2 inch in diameter, a sliver; and drawing-where a drawing frame combines 4 slivers into one-repeated for increased quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCombing: It is optional, but is used to remove the shorter fibres, creating a stronger yarn.\n\nDrawing: It is a process where fibres are straightened, twisted and made into consistent thickness the width of a pencil. These ropes are called 'slivers'. The slivers are later separated into finer yarns called 'rovings'. The rovings feed into looms to make fabric.\n\nWeaving At this point, the 'rovings' are fed into looms to weave them into fabric. The three primary movements of a loom are shedding, picking, and beating-up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

This is done on a frame or machine known as a loom, which are of various types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanised.\n\nKnitting and crocheting involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed either on a knitting needle or on a crochet hook, together in a line. The two processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while crocheting never has more than one active loop on the needle.\n\nSpread tow is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes, and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for composite materials; Spread Tow Fabrics can be made in carbon, aramid, etc.\n\nBraiding or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making macramé.\n\nLace is  made  by  interlocking  threads  together  independently,  using  a  backing  and  any  of  the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.\n\nCarpets, rugs, velvet, velour, and velveteen are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a nap or pile.\n\nFelting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together until they become tangled. A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.\n\nNon-woven textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric. Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.\n\n",
