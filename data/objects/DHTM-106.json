      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

The operational part relating to the housekeeping is dependent  upon  the  co-ordination  of  various  sub-departments  within  the housekeeping department.\n\nFor smooth and efficient functioning of the housekeeping department, it coordinates with several other departments in the hotel such as front office, personnel, purchase, engineering, laundry, food and beverage, security and stores so that no inconvenience is caused to the guest during their stay in the hotel.\n\nThe  job  of  housekeeping  department  in  a  hotel  is  related  to  various departments and their requirement according to a planned schedule, which is made or framed as per the convenience and requirement of other departments. In this unit, basic concept related to hotel housekeeping is developed which will help later in learning various activities conducted in a hotel and other hotel operations. The units in this block also state the importance of the housekeeping department of the hotel and mention its duties and responsibilities.\n\nAs  this  department  and  the  staff  in  this  department  are  very  closely associated with the guest and the guest rooms, it is very important to the personnel department to check and verify the pre-determined quality standards to avoid any further problems and queries. It is also essential to know the qualities that a housekeeping  staff  must  possess  for  the  purpose  of  recruitment,  induction, training, and self-development programmes. These attributes sometimes override the importance of skill as skills can be taught but these personnel traits should be inherent in a member of the staff.\n\n",

The  housekeeping  department  plays  an  important  role  in  keeping  a  clean, comfortable, and safe house (hotel). It is an extension of basic home keeping multiplied  into  commercial  proportions.  The  housekeeping  department  takes pride in making image building for their guests in keeping the hotel clean and comfortable as well as to create a 'home away from home'. To live up to this image in the hotel housekeeping take this task on their shoulders unlike a lady takes care of the house to keep it clean and neat.' This tradition leaded to hotels as well where the housekeeper is, in most cases, a woman.\n\nThe concept of housekeeping is simplistic and very easy to imagine the work but when it comes to maintaining a 'house' of several hundred rooms and numerous public areas, the task becomes challenging and interesting. It takes a well-organized approach and technical understanding. The total percentage of profit of the hotel depends on the sale of rooms, food and beverage and other minor operating services such as the laundry, health clubs, mini-bars, shopping arcade, parlors, spas, etc. The sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 60 per cent. A hotel's largest margin of profit comes from room selling because a room, once made, can be sold repeatedly.\n\nThe room sale depends on the quality of room, interior decor, facilities, cleanliness of the room and safety. To provide a good room to the guest with an excellent appeal and to make him or her comfortable are tasks of housekeeping. It is quite natural that if guest does not feel comfortable in hotel, he will not visit again. Hence, the efforts of housekeeping department ensure clean, comfortable, and safe atmosphere for guests.\n\n",

From the reception desk, the guest goes to the lift, staircase, or corridor to reach the allocated room, possibly passing the lounge and other public areas. On reaching the room, the guest probably has time to explore the surroundings more closely; he or she takes a closer look at the decor, the furnishings and furniture, especially the bed and the cleanliness and comfort of the surroundings. By this time, the guest is better able to judge the standards of the establishment and to decide whether it is likely to meet with requirements and to provide satisfaction. This first impression is probably obtained before the guest has had any food or drink; in fact, the guest may neither eat nor drink in the establishment at all, therefore the basic service provided should be good and clean, comfortable with safe surroundings.

A hotel survives on the sale of rooms, food, beverages, and other minor services such as the laundry, health club and so on. The sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 50 per cent of these sales. Thus, a major part of a hotel's profit margin comes from room sales because a room once made can be sold repeatedly.\n\nThe effort that a housekeeping department makes in giving a guest a desirable  room  has  a  direct  bearing  on  the  guest's  experience  in  a  hotel. Guestrooms are the heart of the hotel. Unless its decor is appropriate, the air odorfree and furnishings and upholstery spotlessly clean, the hotel may lose the guest as a potential repeat customer. The housekeeping department not only prepares clean guestrooms on a timely basis for arriving guests, but also cleans and maintains everything in the hotel so that the property is as fresh and attractive as the day it opened for business.

Because the layout of housekeeping differs from hotel to hotel, and it depends on the size of organization. However, suppose the housekeeper is involved in the planning stage, she must be told the number of function rooms and the volume of business anticipated to estimate the amount of linen required as also the types and sizes of table clothes to cater to a variety of tables. She must also determine whether the management intends to contract out horticulture, tailoring, maintenance, upholstery etc. to include or preclude space for such activities. It is important not to ask for space more than is required because space is limited and entails cost. It is necessary to carefully estimate the traffic flows and size of equipment, trolleys etc. that need to be moved around so that there is no cluttering and congestion. As a rule of thumb, the following spaces would have to be provided for the essential activities of the department.\n\nIntroduction to HouseKeeping  Department\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "One of the essential departments in the hotel is the front office. It is the department that first meets the guest. Rooms are of chief concern to the front office  and  housekeeping  departments.  The  departments  need  to  exchange information on room status continuously. The front office must provide lists for expected arrivals and departures in advance and notify housekeeping about actual arrivals and departures as and when they occur. The front office cannot assign guestrooms until the rooms have been cleaned, inspected, and released by the housekeeping department.\n\nEvery night, a front office assistant produces an 'occupancy report'. It is also called a 'night report'. This report list helps to know an expected check out of the day. The executive housekeeper procures and consults this list early the following day and schedules the occupied rooms for cleaning. As guests check out, the front office notifies housekeeping. Housekeeping ensures that these rooms are given top priority in servicing so that clean rooms are available for sale. If a guest checks out before the stated departure date, the front office must inform housekeeping that the room is no longer a stay-over but is now a checkout. To ensure efficient rooming of guests, both housekeeping and the front office must inform each other of changes in a room's status. Knowing whether a room is occupied, vacant, on change, out of order (OOO), under repair or similar, is vital for proper rooms management. A flow of information in the reverse direction is also necessary, primarily through the 'room status report' or the 'housekeeping status report'. At the end of a shift, the housekeeping department prepares the housekeeping status report, which indicates the physical count to be tallied by the front office. This report indicates the current housekeeping status of each room.\n\nHousekeeping must inform the front office about rooms that are ready for occupation and out of order or under repair. The room status report is compared with the front office's occupancy report, and discrepancies are brought to the attention of the front office manager. A room status discrepancy is a situation in which the housekeeping department's description of a room's status differs from the room status information being used by the front office to assign guestrooms. As unoccupied rooms are cleaned and inspected, the floor supervisors call the housekeeping desk attendant, who informs the front office of ready rooms. The front  office  then  updates  the  room's  status  to  'vacant  and  ready'.  Promptly informing the front office of the housekeeping status of rooms is a tremendous aid  in  getting  guests  who  arrive  early  registered,  especially  during  highoccupancy  or  sold-out  periods.  Keeping  room  status  information  up  to  date requires close coordination between the front desk and housekeeping. The two common systems used for tracking current room status are the manual Whitney room-rack systems and the computerised room status systems. The front desk may use a Whitney room rack to track the status of rooms. In this system, a roomrack slip containing the guest's name and other relevant information is prepared during  the  registration  process.  This  slip  is  placed  in  the  room-rack  slot corresponding to the assigned room number.\n\nThe presence of a room-rack slip in the slot indicates that the room is occupied. When the guest checks out, the rack slip is removed, and the room's status now indicates 'on change', which means the room requires housekeeping services before it can be registered to an arriving guest.

Mr Motwani knew how important the guest was. Mr Larabie was the vice president of a leading international airline; negotiations were on for their crew stays. Pleasing Mr Larabie and meeting his expectations meant around five rooms would be sold per day for the whole of next year - a business deal worth around a crore. Mr Motwani was thus very particular about meeting the guest personally. Still, he had to attend the Management Board Meeting at the head office in Mumbai on Mr Larabie's arrival. So, he called for the Front Office Manager, Mr Salim and realised that he was on leave. He then noted the guest and mentioned that his room should not have any green colour as he has an aversion to it. The message was sent to the newly appointed lobby manager, Mr Walter.\n\nLandmark  International  was  hosting  a  three-day  National  Cardiology Conference from 5th to the 9th of October. Mr Walter, with his new job, wanted to ensure an excellent response from the cardiologists as he knew that this was a prestigious event. He was busy making arrangements for the conventions when the note from the general manager arrived. Mr Walter scribbled a note regarding Mr Larabie's stay to the executive housekeeper mentioning 'no green to be used'.\n\nMs Leena, the housekeeper on duty, received the note and started getting room no. 216 ready for the VIP, Mr Larabie, as instructed by Mr Walter. She noticed no green to be used and got a little confused. She finally decided that some people are allergic to plants, so no greenery by way of foliage or flowers was to be placed in this room. She had such guests before who were allergic to all  plant  material.  She  realised  how  busy  the  Front  Office  was  with  the cardiologists' conference and didn't want to trouble Mr Walter time and again.\n\nThe room was arranged, spic and span, with all the VIP amenities except flowers and indoor plants. Ms Leena herself had checked it with meticulous care, and she was sure that the welcoming VIP Suite would bowl over any VIP guest.\n\nMr Larabie checked in and was escorted by a Front Office Assistant to the VIP Suite. However, he was thoroughly disappointed to find the colour green in the patterns on the carpet, on the lampshades, in the mural painting of trees just above the beautifully made bed and even in the petit fours. He gave instructions to process his check out and decided that if the hotel could not follow a simple request of his, his crew were not likely to be in a relaxed state of mind before their next flight if they stayed here. He didn't put in a formal complaint but decided the status of the contract.\n\n",

      "content": "Tim MacFarlane has been general manager for six weeks at the Executive Inn, a 200-room downtown property. While he's still learning about the property and its personnel, one department stands out in need of immediate attention: housekeeping. Rooms are not getting cleaned on time, shifts are running shortstaffed, and the department is paying a lot of overtime to employees who stay late to catch up. This morning Mr MacFarlane has called Helen Redman, the executive housekeeper, to his office for a meeting.\n\nHelen has been the executive housekeeper at the hotel for 17 years. She has been plagued constantly by staffing shortages during those years. Not enough people want to work as room attendants, it seems. When she meets with Mr MacFarlane, she tries to explain to him that constantly losing people and hiring and training new employees is a fact of life in the housekeeping department. \"It's hard to find people willing to work full time. Jesse will back me up on that.\"\n\n\"Let's have him join us,\" Mr MacFarlane says and has his secretary page Jesse.\n\nJesse Rodriguez, the hotel's human resources director, has been almost as long as Helen. He tells Mr Mac Farlane that Helen is right; housekeeping is a hard department to staff. \"You should see my advertising budget; I run an ad in newspaper every week! No one applies. Every hotel in town is looking for room attendants.\"\n\n\"I may be new, but I know we have got to have good people to be the best we can be,\" Mr MacFarlane replies. \"I challenge you both to be creative. In a city of almost a million people, there must be enough good people out there to staff our housekeeping department. I am willing to do what I can to help. What kind of support do you need from me?\"\n\n",

      "title": "ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

The dust is collected in a container enclosed within the body of the machine (cylindrical or canister models) or on the outside in the form of a bag (upright models). When the cylindrical and canisters models are in use, the hose through which the suction takes place is always attached. The different heads are easily changed, making vacuum cleaners more adaptable than the upright models, suited to large, carpeted areas. To reduce the noise of vacuum cleaners, they are fitted with a filter/diffuser.\n\nSmall suction cleaners are available for upholstery and carpet edges etc., and are easily carried by hand, e.g. dustette or strapped to the operator's back. Large canister-type suction cleaners may be adapted to collect dust or water and are referred to as wet/dry pickups.\n\n15 : Vacuum Cleaner Fig:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCare and Storage : Vacuum cleaners will have a long life and better efficiency if maintained well. The staff need to be trained about the maintenance of vacuum cleaner for better efficiency. The wheels of the machine need to be oiled periodically. After use, the dust bags should be checked and emptied. All the attachments need to be cleaned regularly; a wet vacuum cleaner needs to be emptied, washed, and then wiped after every usage. The hosepipe needs to be hung on hooks, and other attachments should be placed on a shelf for drying.\n\nWet Extractor : Machines that restore the surface appearance by removing the deeply embedded soiling that cannot be removed easily by suction cleaning processes like carpets, upholstery, and curtains.\n\nCarpet Shampooing Machine : The machine is designed for the deep cleaning process of carpets. These machines have a rotary brush in conjunction with  a  range  of  accessories  and  attachments  like  a  tank  for  hot  water  and recommended shampoo used for carpet shampooing. The hot water and detergent are shot into the carpet with high-pressure nozzles, the dirt is flushed to the surface, and the dirty water is removed by suction.

Hence, a weekly schedule is planned so that all intricate areas can be attended once weekly, like high-level dusting (hard to reach areas) or under the bed vacuuming, descaling of coffee kettle, etc.\n\nPeriodic Cleaning : These cleaning tasks are pre-planned and carried out monthly, yearly, or bi-yearly. Examples of such cleaning are carpet shampooing, chandelier cleaning or hard floor polishing.\n\nDeep Cleaning : It is a combined process of cleaning and doing preventive maintenance. This permits the hotel personnel to spend longer time in the area to get the job done thoroughly and not hurry to complete the task.

There  are  several categories of room status, but the room attendant's cleaning schedule will be determined in the following sequence:\n\nCheck-out : A room from which the guest has already checked out\n\nStay-over : A room in which the guest is expected to stay again\n\nDue out : A room from which a guest is scheduled to check out later that day\n\nThe Room Status report is printed from the property management system software. After that, the rooms are assigned to the room attendant based on work standards for specific types of rooms and cleaning tasks decided by the property. The room attendant uses this report to prioritise the workday and proceed with the work accordingly. Checkouts are attended first as these are always in high demand for the front office to resell them to the arriving guest. The exception to this would be if a room is occupied by a VIP or a room having 'clean my room' request, then staff should attend them before checkout rooms. Such may be the operating procedure in some hotels. Secondly, the stayover room needs to be cleaned as these are the guests staying in the hotel (except the 'do not disturb' rooms). These rooms have the sign of DND or double lock, which is a clear indication for the room attendants that the guest does not need service now. The attendant should confirm later as to when the guest wants the room to be made. Expected checkouts or due outs are the last rooms that the room attendants attend. If a guest refuses service, the floor supervisor should call to arrange a convenient time for cleaning.\n\n",

While using ladders, the housemen should take all safety precautions. Many hotels get their public areas cleaned by contractors. Like cleaning in other areas of the hotel, the cleaning routine for public areas can be divided into daily, weekly, monthly, and periodic tasks. Daily cleaning tasks include dusting, emptying ashtrays and bins, suction-cleaning upholstery, mopping hard floors, cleaning glass surfaces, arranging flowers and cleaning toilet areas. Weekly tasks include scrubbing floors, dusting walls, dusting and wiping lighting fixtures, cleaning, and polishing hard surfaces and vacuuming carpets. Monthly tasks cover such activities as spray-cleaning and buffing of floors  and  polishing  furniture  and  other  woodwork.

The various cleaning tasks may be carried out at different periodicities daily, weekly, or less often. While cleaning staircases, care should be taken that dirt and debris do not fall downwards through the gaps in bannisters and railings. Any kind of sweeping should be directed towards the wall. Carpets should be suction cleaned daily, and any stains should be attended to immediately. Due to practical reasons, a backpack type of vacuum cleaner is best for  suction-cleaning  staircases.  Hard-floored  staircases  should  be  suctioncleaned and then damp-mopped. They can be scrubbed weekly with a deck scrubber using a neutral detergent.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Hotel leisure areas include the health club, saunas and solariums, swimming pool, spas and changing areas. These are areas meant for the recreation and relaxation of guests.\n\nHealth Club : The equipment in health clubs includes treadmills, bench presses, rowing machines, cycling machines, dumbbells, etc. The flooring in health clubs should be non-slippery and should not be polished to a very high shine, or else it will not provide good friction for anti-skid properties. The walls will usually have several mirrored panels. Health clubs also have shower cubicles and lockers. The cleanliness of the whole area, including the equipment, is the housekeeping department's responsibility.\n\nSaunas and Solariums : Saunas are steam-bath cubicles made of wood or glass. Solariums are enclosed glass areas for the enjoyment or therapeutic use of sunrays.\n\nCleaning of Saunas : The insides of saunas are prone to mould, as they are warm and moist over long periods. Moss may collect outside too, where there is a lot of moisture. To clean saunas, bleach should be added as a cleaning agent to the water, and a nylon scrubber needs to be used. A concentrated solution of bleach should be used in the most badly affected areas. After cleaning with the bleach, the sauna should be rinsed thoroughly with cold water to remove all residual bleach. The sauna should then be left open to dry so that the fumes from the bleach dissipate. A deodoriser may be used to counteract the smell of the bleach too.\n\nCleaning Solariums : This primarily involves cleaning the glass panels. A proprietary glass-cleaner or a solution of vinegar in water is used for this purpose.\n\nSwimming Pools, Spas and Changing Rooms : Regular cleaning of swimming pools is essential from the point of view of hygiene. If they are not cleaned to a regular schedule, it creates a problem may become carriers of waterborne infections. The swimming pool's water becomes contaminated with body fats and oils, sweat, saliva, urine, cosmetics, and airborne dust particles. However, ideally, the pool should contain as few bacteria as drinking water. The daily cleaning of the swimming pool usually comes under the purview of the housekeeping department. The primary concerns in cleaning swimming pools are water clarity and water chemistry control. Water clarity results from effective filtration to remove all particulate matter. When filters are not effective, they may need cleaning by a backwash cycle, in which a reversed water flow is created through the valves. This forces the discharge of debris into the sewer system.\n\nWater  chemistry  control  implies  the  chemical  safety  of  the  water  for swimming. It involves the maintenance of a neutral ph to control the growth of harmful bacteria in the pool water. If the water is too alkaline, the sides and bottom of the pool will become slippery and prone to black algae. If the water is too acidic, it may deteriorate the pool finish and damage the pump. Chlorine or bromine was earlier used for this purpose but now are discouraged because of specific health hazards such as eye irritation, hair loss and skin rashes resulting from  exposure  to  these.  Spa  baths  are  small  pools  of  warm  water  with  a temperature maintained at a maximum of 39°C. Jacuzzis are small pools in which alternate jets of warm water bring about therapeutic effects. They are cleaned in the same way as swimming pools.\n\n",

Proper use and correct maintenance will help in increasing the life expectancy of the equipment. Nowadays, equipment may be multipurpose; hence the housekeeper should select user-friendly equipment and get maximum functions out of it. Cleaning agents also need to be considered very carefully so that it is not dangerous for the employees to use, and proper guidelines should be set for their usage.\n\nThe guestroom is the most crucial product that hotels sell to generate revenue. In this section, we covered the importance and types of guestrooms that are there in a hotel. It is imperative to maintain the overall look of the place by providing a proper hygienic ambience to the guest. Hence daily cleaning of the guestroom is critical. The guests who come to stay expect a certain level of hygiene and cleanliness for their price. It is the responsibility of the housekeeper to set cleaning standards and ensure they are followed. Efficient cleaning will satisfy guests, which in turn will generate favourable reviews and lead to repeat business.  The  last  portion  of  the  block  deals  with  public  areas  and  their maintenance. It is essential to maintain the standard as it builds up the first impression for the guest. The workflow of cleaning these areas is well distributed throughout the day for housekeeping public area attendant. Some hotels may outsource this cleaning service.\n\n",

      "title": "ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

      "content": "Control Desk needs to have close coordination with Front Office. This is essential to ensure that the rooms are made available for sale at the right time to have maximum occupancy and resultant high revenues and sales. The desk attendant receives departure notification from the front office, which must be transmitted onwards to the appropriate floor so that the rooms can be cleaned and made ready for sale. Once the rooms are cleared, the floor supervisor calls the desk attendant, handing over the cleaned rooms. The desk attendant informs the front  office  regarding  the  cleared  rooms.  The  desk  attendant  also  receives information that requires special attention from Housekeeping. These may be as follows:\n\nVIPs in the House : Knowledge of important guests and their rooms assist the housekeeping department in taking extra care of the guest, ensuring cleanliness, placement of amenities, minibar etc., as per house policies.\n\nGroups  in  the  House  : Since  groups  stay  in  the  house  under  time parameters, it becomes essential to clean their rooms at a set time together. The groups move together during arrivals, departure and sightseeing or for meals, and various activities must be coordinated by the Housekeeping.\n\nAirline Crews : The airline crews are accommodated on specific floors in predetermined rooms. The arrivals and departures of these groups generally overlap, so the rooms need clearance quickly. Due to odd timings, these rooms may be unavailable for cleaning, so alternate rooms might have to be made available by the Housekeeping.\n\nFlowers : Important guests receive special attention in the house, and sometimes the management extends its compliments by a unique gesture of arranging flower arrangements, complimentary fruit baskets, a tray of in-house chocolates or minibar. Housekeeping must ensure that flowers are sent to the correct room number at the right time or changed as per house policies.\n\nThe control desk must coordinate closely with the maintenance department as all maintenance work is generally communicated to the control desk. The control desk needs to inform the maintenance department and get the work done at the earliest. The desk uses maintenance job orders to communicate the work to be done by or maintenance carried out by the engineering department at specified times. Some operations use maintenance registers giving room numbers, the nature of the complaint, and the attendant who lodged the complaint.\n\n",

      "content": "As an example of dealing with emergencies, the procedure for dealing with a bomb threat is outlined below :\n\nBomb threats may be delivered in writing or orally, in person or over the telephone. Nowadays, threats are also sent over the Internet.\n\nIn case of a written threat in the form of a letter, note or telegram, the message and the envelope should be handled carefully and held only at the corners to  preserve  fingerprints  and  other  evidence.  Protect  the  document  and  the envelope and hand it over to the general manager. Inform the police of the contents of the note.\n\nIn case the bomb threat was made orally, as in any employee becoming aware of the bomb threat through personal contact or by overhearing someone make such a threat, the person should immediately convey the information to the general manager in a discreet manner so as not to alarm the guest. The police should be informed promptly. If possible, the person issuing the threat should be kept under observation and the person's physical characteristics noted. These may include the person's height, weight, build, the colour of hair and eyes, description of clothes and jewellery or any other scar or marks on the face etc. These facts should be furnished to the General Manager immediately for communication to security personnel and the police.\n\nThe  most  usual  way  in  which  a  bomb  threat  is  received  is  over  the telephone.  The  switchboard  operators  usually  receive  them  from  the  public telephone number, and the call is typically brief so that there is no chance to trace the number. Therefore, switchboard operators should record the information accurately  to  provide  the  security  and  the  police  personnel  with  as  much documented information as possible.\n\nHousekeeping employees may also be part of the search team looking for unclaimed, unidentified, or unusual foreign objects that could contain the bomb. All housekeeping employees should be aware of the evacuation plans explained in the safety manual of the property and help in evacuation in case it is necessary. In case of an explosion, the employees should help in the rescue process and provide first aid when required.\n\n",
      "summary": "Here is a summary in under 70 words:\n\nIn case of a bomb threat, handle written threats carefully and inform police. Oral threats should be reported discreetly to management and police.

When such a guest checks into the hotel, the front office assistant stamps 'scanty baggage' on the guest's registration card and enters the particulars in the scanty baggage register.

      "content": "The Quick Stop Motel was a small property with a limited staff. It was the first hotel built in the city when the expressway came through forty years earlier.\n\nJuanita looked up and smiled as a guest came toward her cart. \"Good afternoon Mr Tills.\" \"I bet u think its good afternoon,\" Mr Tills snarled at her. \"Best afternoon of your life\"\n\n\"Sir?\" Juanita queried, looking bewildered.\n\n\"Oh, the very picture of innocence!\" he said sarcastically. \"I suppose u don't know anything about my wife's earrings\". Juanita's eyes got wide, and she shook her head slowly. \"Sir, I don't know what you are talking about.\"\n\n\"The earrings you stole from my wife. She left them in the room after she took them off last night and this afternoon they were gone - after you had cleaned the room. If you fork them over right now, maybe I won't tell your supervisor\".\n\nJuanita continued to shake her head, \"Sir I do not steal things, I am not a thief\".\n\n\"Then would you care to tell me where they are? Surely you are not so obtuse that you would vacuum up a pair of $1,000 diamond earrings!\" \"Sir, no, I………….\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" Mr Tills snapped at her, I'll just go the front desk, and you can be sure if I don't get them back, I'll have that $1,000 out of your paycheck!\"\n\nMr Tills turned and stomped off to the front desk, leaving a distraught Juanita,  who  immediately  abandoned  her  cart  and  headed  straight  for  the housekeeping offices. She entered the stock room where Cindy, the executive housekeeper, was going over inventory with the assistant executive housekeeper, Candice.\n\n\"Miss Volk, a guest just accused me of being a thief\", Juanita burst out.\n\nCindy set her clipboard down. Juanita seemed on the verge of either crying or screaming. Cindy wished once again that the hotel had security officers who could handle this situation. She mentioned to Candice to follow her and gently said, \"Juanita, let's go sit in my office and you can tell me what happened.\"\n\nThe three quickly retreated to the executive housekeeper's office, where Cindy sat down beside Juanita, and Candice sat on the chair behind the table.\n\n\"Ok, Juanita you seem very upset. What happened?\" Cindy asked.\n\n\"Mr Tills said I stole his wife's earrings, and he is going to have $1,000 held out of my paycheck. How am I supposed to feed my family if I have to give\n\nhim that amount? Miss. Volk, I have worked for this hotel for 20 years, and no one has ever called me a thief! I don't have to put up with this.\n\n\"Well, I am not going to call you a thief, Juanita. Take a deep breath and let me ask you some questions so we can try to sort this out. Did you clean the Tillses room this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I didn't even see any earrings!\"\n\n\"So, the earrings weren't there when you cleaned the room?\"\n\n\"How should I know? I didn't go through her purse or their suitcases.\"\n\n\"What time did you clean the room?\"\n\nIt was around 9:30 A.M. I saw the Tillses leave for breakfast and wanted to get their room clean for them before they returned.\"\n\n\"Did you observe any unusual activity around the guestroom? Did anyone else enter the room or try the door?\"\n\n\"I am not sure,\" Juanita answered. \"But Evans was working the rooms across the hall; he might have seen something. I only cleaned the poolside rooms on that floor. There was a basketball team checking into rooms down the hall.\"\n\n\"Ok. When you cleaned the room did you move their suitcases and open the drawers?\"\n\n\"Let me try to remember, it was my second room they had a makeup bag on the bed that I moved to the nightstand so I could make the bed.\" Juanita said, \"I didn't open the drawers - I never do in stayover rooms.\"\n\nMark called from the front office to inform the guest complaint about the stolen item.\n\n",

      "title": "ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.\n\nTo ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.\n\nThe  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.\n\nThe  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.\n\nTeaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is\n\nparticularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.\n\nOur team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.\n\nDivide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.\n\nDistance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)\n\n",

It also tries to explain the meaning of the laundry procedure and its importance in the hospitality industry. In an establishment where linen is changed frequently, its life is more often  given  as  perhaps  200-250  washes  rather  than  four  to  five  years.  The relationship  between  housekeeping  and  laundry  is  essential  for  the  smooth functioning  of  the  housekeeping  department.  The  laundry  provides  the housekeeping department with fresh linen and uniforms daily. It also processes the  guest  laundry,  ensuring  guest  satisfaction.  Therefore,  the  housekeeping personnel needs to know something about the laundry operation to understand its importance fully. The selection and designing of uniforms are also discussed with the outline of the advantages of staff uniforms.\n\nThis block also details different types of flower arrangements in a hotel and their importance and uses.\n\n",

Mattress protectors may be woven or quilted fabric or made from felt. Felt ones are generally the least expensive but wear off quickly after repeated washings. Pillows can have cotton, synthetic fibres or hypoallergic foam filler inside them.\n\nFor bath linen, the most common fabric is terry cloth. Better quality towels have selvaged edges - means edges that are woven, not hemmed. These towels have a longer shelf-life and do not unravel quickly. Bathmats are generally heavier and have the same characteristics as other terry items.\n\nTable linen is used for both practical purposes and to add an aesthetic look. Tablecloths, placemats or runners provide a clean eating surface, and napkins help guests stay neat while they eat. Aesthetically, crisp and fresh table linen with folded napkins adds an air of elegance to the dining room. Hotels with dining and banquet services require many tablecloths, table skirts, and silence cloths laid under the tablecloths, which helps absorb the noise. Runners and placemats can make inexpensive and attractive alternatives to tablecloths. They are available in a variety of styles and weaves.\n\n",

Dungarees or overalls must have several deep pockets for the maintenance employees to keep tools handy.\n\nAppearance and Style : A uniform should be designed to look good in all sizes of people.\n\nClimatic Conditions of the Place : Need to be considered for choosing the fabric and pattern of the uniform. If the hotel is not centrally air-conditioned and is a spread-out property, then the management needs to consider the type of fabric and the design of the uniform.\n\nEase of Availability of Materials : the fabric and accessories chosen for the uniform must be readily available whenever new uniforms are required.\n\n",

Guest clothing and uniforms are finished on various steam presses.\n\nFolding : This can be done by hand or by machine. Whatever the case, washing and drying items faster than they can be folded leads to unnecessary wrinkling and re-sorting being required. Folding personnel must also inspect the linen, putting aside those to be laundered again and rejecting stained, torn and otherwise unsuitable items. Folding should be done well away from the stored linen area to avoid re-sorting clean laundry. This step should also be considered a quality-control step.\n\nStoring : After folding, the items are post-sorted and stacked. Post-sorting separates any odd linen types and sizes in the batch that were missed in the presorting step. There should be enough storage room for at least one part of the linen. Finished items should be allowed to 'rest' on shelves for 24 hours after laundering because many types of linen get damaged more easily after washing. Once the linens are on the shelves, yellowing and fading can be spotted easily.\n\nTransferring : Fresh, laundered linen is usually transferred to their areas of use by carts.\n\n",

Unlike laundering, dry-cleaning does not cause swelling of the fibres and does not lead to shrinkage, wrinkles and bleeding of colours. Dry-cleaning is thus a safe method for cleaning delicate textiles. It was earlier known as 'French cleans' or 'chemical cleaning' and is based on the principle that most of the dirt or soiling matter is held to the fabric by grease.

      "content": "appearance. For the arrangement, everything should be in scale. The arrangement may have good style and proportion, but if the background or setting in which it  has  been  placed  is  unsuitable,  it  may  lose  its  charm,  e.g.,  an  abstract arrangement would look out of place in a small cottage setting. Also, a petite arrangement in a large, lofty hall can look pathetic, thus dining table arrangements that obstruct conversation across the table and hall arrangements that block free passage are unsuitable. The texture of the plant material comes in various forms; glossy, velvety, dull, prickly, etc., hence it is a skill to merge this texture with the surrounding arrangement, whether it be the lighting, vase, or container etc. Physical as well as visual balance, needs to be considered. If it is too asymmetrical, then there is a danger that the whole arrangement may fall. The mechanics must always be securely fixed, and the container should always be heavy enough to support the plant material. Sand and gravel can be used to achieve this. The balance from top to bottom also must be considered. Balance with a container, the colour of flowers plays a vital role.\n\nRhythm or Movement : This denotes how your eyes move around when one is observing the flower arrangement. This develops various interesting things while hiding some part of the stems, contrast in the shapes of foliage or colours of the flowers, placing the flowers at different stages, even an irregular line or various sized blooms can obscure the beauty of the arrangement.\n\nColour : In monochromatic colour style- various tints and shades of a single hue are used. Monotonous colours should be avoided; there should be various shapes, sizes, and textures to avoid monotony. In Analogues- two, three or four hues next to each other on a colour wheel are used. The colours used should not occur in equal amounts-one should not be dominant. Whereas in Contrasting/complimentary type- the colours directly across each other on the colour wheel are used, e.g., blue iris with orange gerbera. Contrasting schemes are always lively, but they should not be over-bright. In Polychromatic/rainbow/ scattered - colours from all parts of the colour wheel are used here.

If not, the outcome may be too bright or too spotty.\n\nEmphasis/dominance : This involves having one or more areas in the arrangement to which the eye is drawn and on which it rests for a short time.

In all their arrangements, a single principle is followed, and the most striking characteristic is that they give the impression of naturally growing plants.\n\nIkebana means 'making flowers alive' in Japanese. In all such arrangements, Heaven, Man, Earth is represented using three main branches. Shin, the main spray, is the highest and symbolizes heaven; it ends on the central axis of the vase. This stem should be 1½ - 2½ times the height of the container. See, the second-highest stem represents man. It provides width to the arrangement and is about three-fourths the height of the tallest spray. This stem forms an angle of about 45 degrees with the rim of the container. The lowest spray denotes the earth. This branch is about half as tall as the one signifying man and extends very little beyond the diameter of the container, forming an angle of about 115 degrees with the rim of the container. It is placed opposite the branch signifying man and is used to balance the arrangement.\n\nThe Japanese use tall vases as well as low bowls. Tall vases are usually made of bamboo, bronze or pottery. Sometimes the bamboo ones are painted with black lacquer. Low bowls are made of bronze and pottery. For holding flowers, metal holders are used in vases and bowls.\n\nAnother important aspect of their arrangements is that they always use an odd number of flowers, as they believe that odd numbers are lucky and more aesthetic. Thus in all arrangements, three, five or seven flower sprays are used.\n\nWhen a flat or low container is used, it is called a Moribana style. Moribana is an informal arrangement in a shallow container in which a pin-holder is used as mechanics. When a tall vase without a pin-holder is used, the arrangement is in the Hikae style. A formal arrangement called the Seika style has strict rules governing the lengths and angles of the stems. It is a triangular arrangement and usually stiff so that all stems arise from a single point.\n\nA floating arrangement is called Ukibana, and a basket arrangement is Morimano. Another classical arrangement in a tall cylindrical vase with a flowing and natural effect is called Nagerie.\n\n",

The maintenance and proper handling of linen are essential. Hence, it is a responsibility for the housekeeper to set standards and keep a constant check on the linen in circulation. The housekeeping department does a monthly physical inventory to maintain a proper count. A wide variety of uniforms are found in hotels specific to different departments. Many companies reflect the culture of the hotel's location, and they design uniforms to reflect ethnic wear. Thus, ethnic uniforms give a traditional touch in their service when they interact with the guest. Employee uniforms may vary by department but should convey a common theme within the hotel.\n\nLaundry operations are essential aspects of housekeeping, depending on whether the hotel has an On-Premises Laundry (OPL) or a contracted laundry. This block describes the planning and layout of an OPL for hotels, including various types of equipment found there. Each stage of the laundry cycle has been discussed to understand the whole functioning of the laundry. Dealing with guest laundry is also an important section of the hotel laundry. The last block unit explains  the  floral  arrangement  done  by  the  housekeeping  department,  even though this may sometimes be outsourced. A section on key ingredients for a flower  arrangement  is  detailed,  including  the  equipment  and  its  mechanics. Guidelines on handling flowers and their care are also described.\n\n",
