      "content": "The National Curriculum Framework-2005 (NCF-2005) recommends bringing  work  and  education  into  the  domain  of  the  curricula, infusing it in all areas of learning while giving it an identity of its own at relevant stages. It explains that work transforms knowledge into experience and generates important personal and social values such as self-reliance, creativity and cooperation. Through work one learns to find one's place in the society. It is an educational activity with an inherent potential for inclusion. Therefore, an experience of  involvement  in  productive  work  in  an  educational  setting  will make one appreciate the worth of social life and what is valued and appreciated in society. Work involves interaction with material or other people (mostly both), thus creating a deeper comprehension and  increased  practical  knowledge  of  natural  substances  and social relationships.\n\nThrough  work  and  education,  school  knowledge  can  be  easily linked to learners' life outside the school. This also makes a departure from the legacy of bookish learning and bridges the gap between the school, home, community and the workplace. The NCF - 2005 also emphasises Vocational Education and Training (VET) for all those children who wish to acquire additional skills and/or seek livelihood through vocational education after either discontinuing or completing their school education. VET is expected to provide a 'preferred and dignified' choice rather than a terminal or 'last-resort' option.\n\nAs  a  follow-up  of  this,  NCERT  has  attempted  to  infuse  work across  the  subject  areas  and  contributed  in  the  development  of the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) for the country, which was notified on 27 December 2013. It is a quality assurance framework  that  organises  all  qualifications  according  to  levels  of knowledge, skills and attitude. These levels, graded from one to ten, are defined in terms of learning outcomes, which the learner must possess regardless of whether they are obtained through formal, nonformal or informal learning. The NSQF sets common principles and guidelines for a nationally recognised qualification system covering Schools, Vocational Education and Training Institutions, Technical Education Institutions, Colleges and Universities.\n\nIt is under this backdrop that Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE), Bhopal, a constituent of NCERT  has  developed learning outcomes based modular\n\ncurricula  for  the  vocational  subjects  from  Classes  IX  to  XII.  This has  been  developed  under  the  Centrally  Sponsored  Scheme  of Vocationalisation of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education of the Ministry of Education, erstwhile Ministry of Human Resource Development.\n\nThis textbook has been developed as per the learning outcomes based  curriculum,  keeping  in  view  the  National  Occupational Standards (NOS) for the job role and to promote experiential learning related  to  the  vocation.  This  will  enable  the  students  to  acquire necessary skills, knowledge and attitude.\n\nI  acknowledge the contribution of the development team, reviewers and all the institutions and organisations, which have supported in the development of this textbook.\n\nNCERT would welcome suggestions from students, teachers and parents, which would help us to further improve the quality of the material in subsequent editions.\n\nNew Delhi September 2020\n\nHrusHikesH senapaty Director National Council of Educational Research and Training\n\nNCE\n\n8\n\nbe\n\n",

      "content": "The Hospitality Industry is an industry which mostly depends on the availability of leisure time and disposable income. It comprises of a broad category of fields within the Tourism and Service industry that includes lodging, event planning, theme parks, transportation, cruise  line,  and  other  such  activities.  A  hospitality  unit  such as  a  restaurant,  hotel  or  even  an  amusement  park  consists  of multiple  groups  of  facility  maintenance,  direct  operation  servers, housekeepers, porters, kitchen workers, bartenders, management, marketing and human resources, etc. Some important sectors of the hospitality industry are: Accommodation sector, Food and Beverage sector, Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Events (MICE) sector, Clubs  and  gaming  sector,  Entertainment  and  recreation  sector, Travel and tourism sector, Visitor information sector.\n\nThere is a huge demand of trained and skilled professionals in these  sectors  for  the  numerous  job  roles,  for  example,  Hotel  managers, Food and Beverage Service Managers, Housekeeping Supervisors, Housekeeping  Attendants,  Hotel  Receptionist  and  Clerk,  Bellhop, Meeting  and  Convention  Planner,  Concierge,  Maitre  d',  Executive Chef, Reservation Ticket Agent, Maids and Housekeeping Cleaner, Gaming Dealer and many others.\n\nThe  Housekeeping  Attendant  in  the  Tourism  and  Hospitality Industry is a professional who performs routine duties to maintain public areas, guestrooms and the restrooms in a clean and orderly manner, under the supervision of the Housekeeping Supervisor. The individual  must  know  how  to  use  manual  tools  to  sweep,  scrub, mop, wipe and dispose waste. The attendant should also be able to address guest requests and problems and is expected to maintain a flexible schedule through the weekends and holidays.\n\nThe textbook for the job role of 'Housekeeping Attendant-Manual Cleaning' has been developed to impart knowledge and skills through practicals, which forms a part of experiential learning. Experiential learning focuses on learning by performing the job activities along with the classroom teaching learning process. Therefore, the learning activities are student-centred rather than teacher-centred.\n\nThis textbook has been developed with contributions of the subject experts, industry experts and academicians for making it a useful and inspiring teaching-learning resource material for the students of\n\nvocational studies. Adequate care has been taken to align the content of the textbook with the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for the job role so that the students acquire necessary knowledge and skill  as  per  the  performance  criteria  mentioned  in  the  respective NOS of the Qualification Pack (QP). The Textbook has been reviewed by experts to make sure that the content is not only aligned with the NOS, but is also of high quality.\n\nThe NOS for the job role of 'Housekeeping Attendant-Manual Cleaning' covered through this textbook are as follows:\n\nconduct\n\nUnit 1 of this textbook explains the process of cleaning pantry and canteen area in a hotel which is an important function of the Housekeeping  Attendant.  The  students  will  learn  the  usage  of cleaning agents and equipment for cleaning the kitchen or canteen area, storage and know the importance of maintaining kitchen or canteen checklists and records.\n\nUnit 2 focuses on the preparation of various types of report, record and  documents  by  the  Housekeeping  department  like  logbook, daily assignment sheet, housekeeping room attendant worksheet, room  attendant  checklist  and  report-  linen  consumption  and Indenting, etc.\n\nUnit 3 teaches about how to communicate with the customers and  colleagues, work  communications,  etiquette  and  manner in  communication  with  customers,  grooming  standards  and  its importance in housekeeping room attendant services.\n\nUnit 4 will help the students to learn etiquette and hospitable conduct towards customers. This unit explains about the act with proper level of politeness, office manners and etiquette for various types of guests in different situations.\n\nUnit 5 emphasises on gender and age sensitive practices followed in Indian Tourism and Hospitality industry. It explains the gender issues and their solutions at workplaces, women rights, equality, benefits, safety and security for women customers and staff.\n\nIn  Unit  6,  the  students  will  learn  about  health  and  hygiene service practices, which are performed by the Housekeeping Room\n\nAttendant, such as cleaning and waste segregation at workplace, personal health and hygiene, food and material hygiene in any luxury hotel.  Unit  7  emphasises  on  learning  how  to  maintain  workplace safety standards for hazard-free environment and the measures to avoid  downtime disruption  from  personal  injuries  and  hazardous system failure.\n\nI hope this textbook will be useful for students and teachers who will opt for this job role. I shall be grateful to receive suggestions and observations from readers which would help in bringing out a revised and improved version of this textbook.\n\nMridula saxena Professor Department of Home Science and Hospitality Management PSSCIVE, Bhopal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n",

Germs in a food production area may spread and the food will not be safe for consumption.\n\nCleanliness is important in the Hospitality Industry. If the canteen premises and serving or eating crockery and cutlery are not clean, the guests will notice this and would not want to eat at such a place. Not only this, but also the guest would not recommend the canteen or eatery to other people, leading to loss of business.\n\nTo keep this in check, the government has made some rules for the prevention of food infection. In India, this law is called the Food Act. It sets minimum (lowest level) standards for cleanliness of food storage, preparation and service areas, and for hygienic (clean) food handling practices.\n\nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is one more systematic preventive approach to protect food from biological, chemical and physical hazards in transportation.

Clean and then disinfect after wiping up spills from raw food.\n\nFood and drink spill are among the toughest cleaning problems to deal with for a Housekeeping Attendant. It is a common occurrence, yet some do not know the ideal way of dealing with the cleaning of the sudden mess. Not knowing the basics of cleaning up food and drink spills can really put the hotel Attendant at a disadvantage.\n\nFollowing points are to be kept in mind while cleaning food spillage:\n\none  teaspoon  of  laundry  detergent  (non-bleach) and a cup of warm water. This is likely to get rid of any stains and spills from food and drinks faster.\n\n",

The  people moving away from their residence for any reason need to  fulfill  the  basic  requirements  of  food,  clothing  and shelter.

      "content": "Companies  around  the  world  are currently going through a period of transforming and changing. Some are  expanding  their  business  globally  while  some  are wondering how the change will impact their organisation. As  we  know,  persons  of  all  genders  are  entering  the labour  force  in  equal  numbers  but  the  majority  of top  management  positions  still  belong  to  men.  Still discrimination at the workplace on the basis of gender remains a problem as social norms continue to restrict the occupational choices by women and men, thereby distorting labour markets, depressing wages, and hurting business innovation and productivity. Women are often unable to break the upper levels of corporate management  due  to  'glass  ceiling'.  The  term  'glass ceiling' refers to situations where the advancement of a qualified person within the hierarchy of an organisation is  stopped  at  a  lower  level  because  of  some  form  of discrimination, most commonly sexism or racism.\n\nThere are many reasons that cause this situation. One  of the reasons  is job segregation. It is the concentration  of  women  and  men  in  different  types and levels of activities and employment. Usually, men tend to be highly concentrated in the professions such as  managers,  supervisor,  production  supervisors  and executives. Women, on the other hand, tend to occupy lesser  paid  professions  such  as  teachers,  secretaries, receptionists and nurses.\n\nSadly, there are many barriers that prevent women from  reaching  one  of the higher positions in an organisation.  One  of  the  barriers  is  the  environment\n\nat a workplace.  Organisational  culture,  employees' attitude and racial stereotypes commonly limit women from actively participating in the organisation. Working parents, especially mothers, usually have to deal with family  obligation.  They  often  have  to  choose  between their  job  and  family  for  which  they  require  flexible hours at work. The concept of spending equal time with the family by all genders is still not culturally popular in India.\n\nMany organisations  are  trying  to  integrate  changes to  enable  more  women  to  become  a  part  of  the  top management  positions  and  fulfil  their  dreams.  Some examples are work from home, flexible timing and so on.\n\nFollowing  measures  can  be  adopted  to  provide equality for women at work across both horizontal and vertical segregation:\n\n",

These may include unsafe working conditions or processes, environmental hazards, drug and alcohol abuse and workplace violence.\n\nWorkplace safety equally promotes the wellness of employees as well as employers. Better safety equates to  better  health.  A  safe  and  healthy  workplace  would not only ensure protection of workers from injury and illness,  but  would  also  lower  the  costs  on  account  of injury  or  illness,  reduce  absenteeism  and  increase turnover, productivity and quality; and keep the morale of  the  employees  high.  Healthier  employees  do  tasks more efficiently, and they are happier in general. There are very few accidents in a safe working environment. Thus,  safety  is  not  only  good  but  also  desirable  for business.\n\nIn this unit, you will learn about the workplace safety standards to have a hazard-free work environment and avoid loss of man-hours because of disruption caused by personal injuries and hazardous system failures.\n\nThe unit covers the following major topics:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nman-hour: an hour regarded in terms of the amount of work that can be  done  by  one  person within this period.\n\n(Source: Oxford  Dictionary of English, Third Edition)\n\n",
