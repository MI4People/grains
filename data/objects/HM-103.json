      "content": "The guestroom is the main product of a hotel, as it contributes to more than 50 per cent of the total sales, making the profit percentage from room sales very high. The ‗sale'  of  a  room  means  leasing  the  room  for  occupation  for  24  hours  at  a  predetermined cost. Thus, a room sold on a particular day earns revenue for that day, and then  it  can  be  sold  again,  and  again.  Rooms  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‗highly perishable commodities' as rooms not sold for the day lose out on the revenue for that day.  In  addition  to  earning  revenues,  guestrooms  also  have  a  role  in  the  imagebuilding of the hotel. Guests may stay in a hotel for pleasure, convenience, or from necessity. Whatever the reason for the stay, the will always expect a certain standard of  service  and  comfort.  It  is  hence  essential  for  each  and  every  hotel  employee  to understand  the  importance  of  a  guestroom  for  a  guest.  The  housekeeping  staff,  in particular, has the responsibility of making the guestroom ‗a home away from home' for the guest.\n\n",

      "content": "value for money. Nothing sends a stronger message than cleanliness in a hospitality industry. No level of service, friendliness or glamour can equal the sensation a guest has upon entering a spotless, tidy and conveniently arranged room. Both management and guest consider keeping the place clean and in good order a necessity, for a hotel to command a fair price and to get repeat business.\n\nA survey carried out showed 63% travelers rated cleanliness and appearance as their first priority in their choice of hotels. The housekeeping department takes pride in keeping the hotel clean and comfortable so as to create a ‗home away from home'. Good  housekeeping  is  considered  as  the  backbone  of  accommodation  sector  as  its main  aim  is  to  provide  a  clean  comfortable,  safe  and  aesthetically  appealing environment.\n\nHousekeeping is an operational department of the hotel. It is responsible for cleanliness,  maintenance,  aesthetic  upkeep  of  rooms,  public  areas,  back  areas  and surroundings.\n\nA hotel survives on the sale of rooms, food, beverage, and other minor services like laundry, health clubs, health spa, sightseeing, shopping arcades etc. The sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 50% of these sales.\n\nThus a major part of hotels margin of profit comes from room sales because a room once made can be sold over and over again. However, the days when the room remains  unsold  there  is  a  total  loss  of  revenue.  To  this  extent,  rooms  are  more perishable  than  food.  The  housekeeping  budget  typically  accounts  for  20%  of  the properties  total  operating  expenditure.  The  largest  element  of  operating  cost  in  the housekeeping  department  is  labour.  The  effort  that  the  housekeeping  department makes in giving a guest a desirable room has a direct bearing on the guest experience in the hotel.\n\nGuest rooms are the heart of the hotel. Unless the décor is appropriate, the air odour free, furnishing and upholstery is spotlessly clean the hotel may loose a guest as a  potential  customer.  The  housekeeping  department  not  only  prepares  the  clean guestroom  on  a  timely  basis  for  the  guests  who  are  arriving  but  also  cleans  and maintains everything in the hotel so that the property is fresh and attractive as the day it  opens  for  business.  The  housekeeping  thus  contributes  in  a  big  way  towards  the overall  reputation  of  a  property.  It  is  a  24  hour  and  365  day  operation.  Scientific housekeeping demands the employment of the most effective cleaning materials and procedures, attention to  purchasing the most suitable linen supplies, maintenance of decorative area under the housekeeping department purview and proper organization and supervision.\n\nOther than hotels, professional housekeeping service is very much in demand in  hospitals,  cooperate  buildings,  airports,  airlines,  cruisers,  banks  shopping  arcade. Since  most  such  organizations  prefer  to  outsource  these  functions,  contract housekeeping is becoming a lucrative entrepreneurship venture these days.\n\n",

      "content": "It is extremely important to understand the expectations of a guest when he/she pays to  stay  in  a  room.  People  nowadays  travel  a  lot  more  than  they  did  earlier,  and  the expectations  from  hotels  are  constantly  on  the  rise.  In  such  a  scenario,  continuous analysis of guest expectations becomes necessary. Given that a hotel is often referred\n\nto as ‗a home away from home', there would be similarities in a guest's expectations from a hotel and from a home. These similarities would dictate that the guestrooms be neat,  hygienic,  comfortable,  private,  and  above  all,  safe.  The  most  important consideration  here  is  staff  needs  to  understand  and  respect  the  guest's  expectations from the guestroom and the hotel staff.\n\nPrimarily, a neat room is the basic minimum expectation of any guest, and the staff needs to ensure this by laying out fresh linen and presenting a clean room on a daily  basis.  The  room  should  not  only  be  attractive,  but  also  comfortable  and functional.  Hotel  guests  expect  a  high  degree  of  cleanliness,  leading  to  a  hygienic environment to stay in. For instance, guest that the hotel has provided them a sanitized toilet when they see a disinfected paper strip on the toilet seat. The ‗basic necessities' in a guestroom are constantly varying. Nowadays these may include Internet and WiFi connectivity, channel music, television, temperature control, and so on. Guests also expect that they will not be disturbed often and that the location of the rooms would be such that they have a good view. Safety, as we have already mentioned, is a key factor with regard to guestrooms - guest would like the guestroom location to be safe and  not  accessible  to  one  and  all.  The  doors  of  a  guestroom  should  have  a  double locking system operable from inside, along with strict control measures in the hotel with regard to the handling of guestroom keys and master keys. Fire-exit layouts being placed  in  the  rooms  is  a  necessity  as  well.  Irrespective  of  its  location,  a  guestroom should  also  offer  easy  access  to  other  guest  service  areas,  such  as  restaurants, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and so on, with clear directions to and from the room or elevator being posted in corridors.\n\nThe  guest  would  also  expect  to  be  able  to  get  in  touch  with  ancillary departments  providing  other  services  to  guests  from  the  room  itself.  The  various services- such as room service, restaurants, housekeeping, valet, and so on- should be clearly indicated with explanation and intercom numbers in the literature on the house rules and in the information kits placed in each guestroom.\n\n",

The office should be leaded  by  a  cabin  for  the  secretary  who  would  control  movement  into  the  house keeper's office.\n\nDesk control  room :  This  room  acts  as  a  nerve  system  center  for  coordination  and communication with the front office and other departments.  The desk  control  room should have a large notice board to pin up staff schedules and day to day instructions. The desk control room is the point where all staff report for duty and check out at the duty end.\n\nLinen room :  This  is  the  room where current linens are stored for issue and receipt. The  room  should  be  large  airy  and  free  from  heat  and  humidity.  It  should  have adequate shelves, easily accessible to stack all linen. It should be secured and offer no possibilities  of  pilferage.  The  linen  room  should  have  a  counter,  across  which  the exchange of linen takes place. The room should preferably be adjoining the laundry so as to supply linen to and from the laundry.\n\nLinen  room  store :  This  room  stores  the  stock  of  new  linen  &  cloth  materials  for uniform, etc. the stock maintained should be enough to replenish the whole hotel at a time.  However,  these  stocks  are  only  touched  when  the  current  linen  in  circulation falls  short  due  to  shortage,  damage  or  loss.  The  room  should  be  cool  and  dry  with ample shelves, generally 6\" above the ground.\n\nUniform room : This room stocks the uniform in urgent use. It is possible that smaller hotel  may  choose  to  combine  the  uniform  room  with  the  linen  room.  A  separate uniform room really depends upon the volume of uniforms in circulation. The only difference  will  be  that  the  uniform  room  would  have  adequate  hanging  facilities  as many uniforms are best maintained when hung.\n\nTailor's  room :  This  room  is  kept  for  house  tailors  who  attend  to  the  stitching  and patch-up  work  of  linen  and  uniforms.  Room  is  avoided  if  the  mending  and  the stitching jobs are done in contract basis.\n\nLost and found section ; This section should be small and airy with cupboards to store guest articles lost and may be claimed later.\n\nFlower room : This should be air conditioned room to keep flowers fresh. The room should have work table, a sink with water supply and all necessary tools required for flower arrangement.\n\nLaundry :  This  is  an  important section under housekeeping which is responsible for cleaning of all fabrics used in hotel. The section should be adjacent to linen room so as  to  avoid  excessive  steps.  Laundry  should  ensure  the  cleanness  and  drying  of  all guest clothes, employee uniforms and linen to the best assured standard.\n\n",

Commonly the term ‗starching' is used for the process, even though the stiffening agent may be something more than starch. Softening - Fabric tend to start feeling harsh after repeated laundering. This is due to the build-up of salts (present in hard water) on the fibres during the last rinse of the washing process. Softness can be imparted to these fabrics using chemical softeners in alaundry  process.  Softeners  coat  the  fibres  of  the  fabric  and  make  them  softer  and fluffier.\n\nBleaches: The  chemical  are  capable  of  whitening  fabrics  and  removing  stains  by destroying  pigmented  matter.

The bleach should be left in contact with the fabric only until the stain is removed or else the fabric will be weakened.\n\nOpen air sunlight -  This  is  the  world's  oldest  and  cheapest  method  of  bleaching.

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Design elements are the basic units of a visual image. These elements include:\n\nThe 3 f's: Form, Follows and Function are known as the 3 f's of Design. Form refers to what something looks like, and function refers to how it works.\n\nSpace: Space  is  the  area  provided  for  a  particular  purpose.  It  may  have  two dimensions  (length  and  width,  such  as  a  floor,  or  it  may  have  three  dimensions (length,  width,  and  height).  Space  includes  the  background,  foreground  and  middle ground. Space refers to the distances or areas around, between or within components of a piece. There are two types of space: positive and negative space. Positive space refers to the space of a shape representing the subject matter. Negative space refers to the space around and between the subject matter.\n\nLine: Line  is  the  basic  element  that  refers  to  the  continuous  movement  of  a  point along  a  surface,  such  as  by  a  pencil  or  brush.  The  edges  of  shapes  and  forms  also create lines. It is the basic component of a shape drawn on paper. Lines and curves are the basic building blocks of two dimensional shapes like a house's plan. Every line has length,  thickness,  and  direction.  There  are  curved,  horizontal,  vertical,  diagonal, zigzag, wavy, parallel, dash, and dotted lines.\n\nColour: Colour is seen either by the way light reflects off a surface or in colours light sources. Colour and particularly contrasting colour is also used to draw the attention to a  particular  part  of  the  image.  There  are  primary  colours,  secondary  colours,  and tertiary colours. Complementary colours are colours that are opposite to each other on the  colour  wheel.  Complementary  colours  are  used  to  create  contrast.  Analogous colours are colours that are found side by side on the colour wheel. These can be used to create colour harmony. Monochromatic colours are tints and shades of one colour. Warm colours are a group of colours that consist of reds, yellows, and oranges. Cool colours are group of colours that consist of purples, greens, and blues.\n\nShape: A shape is defined as an area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, colour, or texture. They can be geometric or organic. Shapes in hotel decor and interior design can  be  used  to  add  interest,  style,  theme  to  a  design  like  a  door.  Shape  in  interior design  depends  on  the  function  of  the  object  like  a  kitchen  cabinet  door.  Natural shapes forming patterns on wood or stone may help increase visual appeal in interior design. In a landscape, natural shapes, such as trees contrast with geometric such as houses.\n\nTexture: Texture is perceived surface quality. In art, there are two types of texture: tactile  and  implied.  Tactile  texture  (real  texture)  is  the  way  the  surface  of  an  object actually feels. Examples of this include sandpaper, cotton balls, tree bark, puppy fur, etc. Implied texture is the way the surface of an object looks like it feels. The texture may look rough, fizzy, gritty, but cannot actually be felt. This type of texture is used by artists when drawing or painting.\n\nForm: Form  is  any  three  dimensional  object.  Form  can  be  measured,  from  top  to bottom  (height),  side  to  side  (width),  and  from  back  to  front  (depth).  Form  is  also defined by light and dark. There are two types  of form, geometric (man-made) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture and colour. It can be illustrated or constructed.\n\nValue: Value is an element of art that refers to the relationship between light and dark on a surface or object and also helps with Form. It gives objects depth and perception. Value is also referred to as tone.\n\n",

      "content": "The elements of art are line, form, colour and texture.  This must be handled within conformity with certain principles and laws that govern their use if beauty is to result. Every art field has certain guidelines that are to be followed and the same is applicable in planning of interiors.\n\nScale  and  proportion: By  habit,  the  human  eye  becomes  accustomed  to  definite dimensions  in  daily  life.   Some  of  these  dimensions  are  fixed  for  convenience. Proportion is the law of relationship, which demands that all space divisions should be pleasingly related to each other and to the whole. The Greeks developed a great deal of calculations about space distribution and a scale of space relationships. These skills are used even today.  The normal ratios are 2:3, 3:5 and 5:8.  These forms are equal divisions.   A  square  room  is  more  difficult  to  arrange  and  uninteresting  to  live  in. Rooms  should  be  preferably  furnished  with  smaller  furniture  types  and  consistent patterns.  The furniture should be in proportion to the size and height of the room and its architectural features.\n\nBalance: It  is  the  principle  of  design,  which  produces  a  feeling  of  restfulness  and contentment.  Balance deals with quantity or number in the arrangement, colour and distribution  of  pattern  or  plain  surfaces.   Balance  is  the  result  of  equalisation  of attraction  on  either  side  of  a  central  point.   Balance  can  be  attributed  to  colours, texture, pattern and light. There are two types of balance:\n\nFormal Balance: Formal or symmetrical balance occurs when objects of equal size and weight are placed on each side and at equal distance from the centre.  When they are identical, the balance is symmetrical.\n\nInformal  Balance: Informal  or  asymmetrical  balance  results  when  objects  are arranged in such a way that a large one nears the centre, smaller ones away from the centre.

It can be obtained through a repetition of light, forms, and colours or  through  a  progression  of  rise  or  continuous  line  movement.   Rhythm  is  achieved through repetition, progression, transition, opposition and radiation.\n\nEmphasis: It  is  the  principle  of  design  that  centres  interest  on  the  most  important thing in the arrangement in a room. Emphasis may be centred on a painting, fireplace, window treatment or furniture grouping.  All other parts must be subordinated to the interesting point.  It is better to understand emphasised rather than over emphasized. Emphasis can be created at any point in the room.  Dramatic use of art components creates emphasis i.e. Large and unusual forms, different surface patterns, more light elsewhere and unusual texture and contrasting colours.\n\n",

The study  of  colour  may  be  approached  from  any  of  the  five  angles  i.e  physiologist, chemists,  physicist  and  psychologists  or  people  who  works  with  pigments.  Of  the many theories of colour two are in common use. These are generally known as the Prang system and Munsell system.\n\nDimension of Colours: When the average person thinks of color, he or she usually considers  the  aesthetic  aspects  of  color  such  as  the  shade  and  whether  it's  light  or dark; or a cool or warm tone. There are three properties or qualities that develop the 3dimensional  color  space  concept-  distint  as  the  length,  breath  and  thickness  of  an object.\n\nHue: Hue represents the color itself-red, yellow, blue, etc.   If you were to take the visible spectrum-red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo and violet-and place  each  color  in  a  circle.  The  colour  of  an  object  is  determined  by  the wavelengths  of  the  light  reflect.  An  object  appears  black  when  all  the wavelengths are absorbed and white when all reflected.\n\nValue: It  is  the  one  dimension  of  color  space  that  can  stand  alone.  Value represents the lightness or darkness of a given hue the value ranges from 0 for pure black to 10 for pure white.  In the absence of hue you would simply have black, white or shades of gray.\n\nTint is the term used to describe a hue that has been lighted in value from its normal value. Pink is tint of red. Tints are achieved by mixing white with a pigment or by using a pigment in a dilute form to allow for the white of the ground to show through.\n\nShade is the term used to describe a hue that has been darkened in value from its normal value.  That your coat is not true blue but some blend of blue with other colors. Maroon is a shade of red. Shades are achieved by mixing black with a pigment. NoteThis use of the term shade is specific to color theory. In common usage a -shade‖ is usually a variation in color of a hue. To say -your coat is a nice shade of blue‖ usually means\n\nIntensity/Chrome: It  refers  to  the  purity  of  a  hue  and  the  brightness  or dullness  of  a  color  Intensity  is  also  known  as Chroma or Saturation .  The highest intensity or purity of a hue is the hue as it appears in the spectrum or on the color wheel. A hue reduced in intensity is called a Tone . A tone is a hue with reduced or dulled strength.\n\n",

However, A.H. Munsell saw color in terms of its relationship to other colors, which led him to develop his 3-dimensional color space concept.

      "content": "Colour is a very potent feature in interior design because it evokes almost immediate response  from  the  eye  and  can  produce  both  physical  and  psychological  reaction. Designers can work wonders with colour and colour combinations if they have a good knowledge of colour and its effects.\n\nA good decorator always combines both value and practicality to evolve a scheme, which will work to the best advantage of the interiors.  Standard colour harmonies are divided into two main groups:\n\nSimilar or related harmonies: Selecting colours that are close to each other on the colour wheel produces related harmony. This includes two types of schemes\n\nMonochromatic  harmony indicates  the  selection  of  one  colour  or  hue.   Different values must contrast in a single colour harmony.  This scheme is quite safe, effective, and  peaceful  in  small  areas.  However,  tends  to  get  tiresome  and  monotonous,  if carried  out  in  an  entire  room.   Additional  interest  may  be  created  by  providing contrasts and combining textures through various surfaces.\n\nAnalogous scheme is produced by a combination of adjacent hues that have one hue in common.  The analogous are a combination of primary or secondary colours with two intermediate colours on either side of it.  This scheme is quite restful and shows greater varieties.\n\nContrasting  or  complimentary  harmony: Combining colours  that  are  opposite  to each other and far away on the colour wheel produces complimentary harmony. They should differ in value and intensity.\n\nThis group includes different types:\n\nComplimentary  Harmony: This  is  obtained  by  using  colours  lying  opposite  each other on the colour wheel e.g. Blue and orange with yellow and violet etc.  This type of  harmony  provides  a  richer  effect  of  colour  than  related  harmony.   It  can  be successfully  used  for  rooms,  window  displays  and  outdoors.   It  should  have  strong colour intensity.\n\nDouble Complimentary Harmony: In this scheme, two directly adjacent colours and their complimentary colours are used together for a double complimentary harmony e.g.  Yellow  and  yellow  green  with  red  and  red  violet.   In  using  this  scheme,  the outstanding view should contain the largest amount of colours, that is, the dullest of all the colours.  The next may be a little bright but should be partially neutralised.  The fourth colour, which is used in the least quantity, should have the brightest intensity.\n\nSplit  Complimentary  Harmony: It  is  the  combination  of  primary  or  intermediate colours on either side of the colour wheel; compliment yellow with red violet and blue violet, blue with red orange and yellow orange, red with blue green and yellow green etc.  A true split complimentary scheme is a harmony of similar colours with a note of contrasting colours. The amount of different values and intensities should be adjusted to prevent a shocking effect.\n\nTriad Harmony: This is a combination of any three colours that form on equilateral triangle on the colour wheel.  It requires careful treatment and can provide the richest and  most  interesting  harmony.   But  if  not  carefully  planned,  it  can  have  a  very irritating effect e.g. Red yellow blue orange, violet & green and red violet blue green and yellow orange.\n\nAccented Neutral Harmony: It  is  a  harmony  in  which  the  largest  area  of  the  room will be neutralised with a smaller area in a brighter colour.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "How Colour Affects Mood: Relying strictly on the colour wheel to make decorating decisions leaves an important factor out of the equation: the moods that colours can create.  The  colours  you  live  with  really  do  influence  your  emotions.  Some  palates lighten and brighten your mood while others pacify or purify. We respond to colour with our hearts, not just our heads, so it's important to choose wisely. Understand that colours behave in three basic ways -- active, passive, and neutral -- and you can easily match  every  room's  colours  to  your  personal  desires  and  taste  and  to  the  room's purpose.\n\nActive Colours: On the warm side of the colour wheel, active colours include yellow, orange, and red. These advancing, extroverted hues stand out to greet and sometimes dominate.  They  inspire  conversation  and  an  upbeat  attitude.  Red,  the  most  intense, pumps the adrenaline like no other hue. Small doses of the fire-engine hue wake up an entry or turn up the heat on a hearthside den. Golden or lemony yellows -- good for home offices and kitchens -- unleash creative juices.\n\nPassive  Colours: The  cool  colours  -  blue,  green,  and  purple  -  will  pacify,  staying quietly  in  the  background  to  calm  and  restore  depleted  spirits.  They're  ideal  for bedrooms or private retreats, but if yours is a cold climate, you may want to work in some sunny accents for warmth and contrast.\n\nNeutral Colours: Neutralizers are the \"uncolors\": browns, beiges, greys, whites, and taupe. They neither activate nor pacify but combine and cooperate, bridging together different  rooms and colours. They're good transitions on woodwork, trim, hallways, and  functional  spaces  like  kitchens  and  baths,  but  even  living  rooms  can  benefit. Darker neutrals tone down other colours; crisp white intensifies them.\n\nColour  Language: Curious  about  how  colour  influences  mood?  Here  are  a  few examples:\n\nPink: soothes, acquiesces; promotes affability and affection.\n\nYellow: expands, cheers; increases  energy. It  is  warm  but  not  over  bearing. Cream and light tans are suitable background colours.\n\nWhite:\n\nBlack:\n\npurifies, energizes, unifies; in combination, enlivens all other colours. disciplines, authorizes, strengthens; encourages independence.\n\nOrange: cheers,  commands;  stimulates  appetites,  conversation,  and  charity. Beige and tan are favoured as background colours.\n\nRed: empowers,  stimulates,  dramatizes,  competes;  symbolizes  passion.  It  is the strongest of colours and is associated with danger.  When reduced to a tint of pink it losses its intensity and becomes milder and delicate.  As a shade, red may give a warm brown.\n\nGreen: balances,  normalizes,  refreshes;  encourages  emotional  growth. It  is associated with nature, health and well-being.   It provides dignity and solidity. Purple : comforts, spiritualises; creates mystery and draws out intuition.\n\nBlue: relaxes, refreshes, cools; produces tranquil feelings and peaceful moods. It  is  associated  with  simplicity,  purity,  truth  and  meditation.   It  stimulates intellectual activity but in the extreme, it could lead to depression.\n\nViolet :  It  is  the  colour  of  tension  and  ambiguity.  It  represents  sensitivity, subtlety and has lavender in playful and magical.  Deep violet should be used with caution.\n\nA combination  of  colours  from  the  three  families  i.e.  Warm,  cool  and  neutral  in  a correct  balance  will  provide  attractive  and  comfortable  interiors.   Colours  may  also have an advancing or receding effect.   Warm colours tend to appear closer than their actual distance while cool colours tend to have a receding effect. Spaces can be made to seem larger or smaller through choice of colours and shape.  A long narrow space can be made to seem less long and less narrow through the use of warm colours on either ends and cool colours on the sides. A low ceiling will seem less oppressive in light colours where as a high ceiling will appear lower in dark tones.\n\n",

Light colours are soiled easily and may prove to be more expensive in terms of time and money.  In private areas, it is  important to create a personalised colour atmosphere.  In a room shared by many groups, preference should prevail, e.g. Restaurants, lobby and other public places. Sub divide a room into the following areas of colour distribution - dominant area (walls, floor  and  ceilings)  medium  area  (draperies,  upholstery,  furniture  and  bed  spreads), small  furniture  (cushions,  pillows  and  table  cloths),  accent  areas  (accessories, paintings, lamp shades etc.)\n\nAccording to the law of chromatic distribution, the largest area should be covered with a  neutralised  colour.   As  the  area  reduces  in  size,  chromatic  intensity  may  be proportionally increased. Any two hues may be used if they are at the proper degree of neutralisation.   They  should  preferably  contrast  in  their  values,  e.g.  Like  walls  and dark floor where the draperies and upholstery are of an intermediate value. Contrast\n\ncreates interest; neutral colours are formal while brighter values are more informal.  A neutralised colour appears more neutral in small areas than in larger areas.\n\nColours  selection  is  influenced  by  climate,  orientation  activity  and  preference.  In hotels, entrances, lobbies and front desk areas invite the use of strong colours to make a  positive  first  impression.   Lobbies  and  lounges  can  have  warm  colours  to  support comfort  but  cooler  tones  in  warm  climate.   All  the  schemes  should  be  generally agreeable  to  the  guest.   Corridors  leading  to  guest  room  should  be  given  a  lively colour treatment.  In bedrooms, intense colour must be avoided on ceilings and large wall  areas.   Restaurants  may  fail  by  using  insensitivity  to  colour  since  appetite  is influenced by light and colour.  Black, grey, blue and violet should be avoided.\n\n",

Plain, heavy curtains falling down to the floor can be used o create  a  formal  setting.  Short  curtains  made  of  light,  brightly  patterned  fabrics  are used  to  create  an  informal,  relaxed  atmosphere.  Apart  from  creating  the  desired atmosphere, curtains give flexible control over privacy, heat, light and to some extent noise.  The  various  fabric  used  for  making  curtains  are  cotton,  linen,  rayon,  glass fibres, acrylic and silk for luxurious setting. Care should be taken to minimize their exposure to sunlight and airborne soils, as these reduce the curtains' functional life. Good curtains are usually lined and heavy curtains re interlined. The lining helps the curtain to drape well and protect them for sunlight and airborne dust.\n\nCurtains fulfill several important functions    :\n\n",

Most  people  will  purchase  curtains  as  an afterthought, something that needs to go up but doesn't really matter. The problem is the  window treatments  do  matter  and  it  should  be  an  active  decision  when  you  are designing  your  decor.  Selecting  the  right window  curtains can  be  surprisingly complex. If you choose the wrong type or the wrong color, it can completely ruin the design that you have. Finding the best curtains for your room can lead to a flow in style  that  will  have  any  professional  interior  designer borrowing from  your idea for future projects.  If  you are trying to select window treatments for your home but are unsure of where to start, there are a few pointers that will help make finding the right window curtains much easier.\n\nKeep the curtains in the room: This is actually a mistake that many people make. They find a curtain style and they put the same curtains into every room whether it looks  good  with  the  decor  or  not.  The  simple  fact  is  each  room  can  have  different curtains, unless you are working with an open floor concept\n\nUnderstand your privacy: One of the more popular window treatments that you can find are sheer drapes. While these are wonderful in many different areas, they are not\n\nthe best style of drape to purchase if you want to have a little privacy since you can see through most sheer drapes. Bedrooms should never have sheer drapes solely, and neither  should  bathrooms  for  that  matter.  Instead,  pair  them  with  a  darker  drape  or window covering that does just that; covers.\n\nUnderstand the lighting: When it comes to windows, not all of them produce the same amount of lighting and this will affect the type of drapes that you use. Drapes that are heavy can block out a lot of light and this works well in a bedroom, especially bedrooms that offer amazing views of the sunrise. Sheer drapes are excellent for sun rooms  that  don't  need  a  lot  of  privacy.  Sheers  provide  a  light  airy  feel  that  work wonderfully in many spaces. When you know the amount of light coming through the window, you can plan accordingly.\n\n",

Eventually new filling materials such as cotton, silk cotton and artificial fillers became common. In modern times most mattresses use springs, solid foam, latex, water, or air. As time passes on more and more people are looking for a better medium to sleep, since people spend a large percentage of time in life in a bed. It has become a more recent realization for many, to attribute health deteriorations to what they lay on. Water resilient fibers (natural and synthetic), latex, synthetic foams and a combination of  a  huge  range  of  different  spring  technologies  are  used  in  the manufacture of beds. For greater head support, most people use a pillow, placed at the top of a mattress. Also used is some form of covering blanket to provide warmth to the sleeper, often bed sheets, a quilt, or a duvet.\n\nAlso, some people prefer to dispense with the box spring and bed frame, and replace it with a platform bed style.

In the moulds, the foam gets shaped set and vulcanized without losing any of its tiny air cells.\n\nSolid Stuffed Mattresses: These mattresses are made by filling a ticking with padding. The padding may be in the form of animal hair, cotton, kapok, wool, coil or flock.\n\nPlastic Mattress: These are made from polyethene and vinyl foam.

Arrangements may have also to be two sided or all round.\n\nBalance: Materials should be placed to give a feeling of stability.  Form and colour are important aspects of balance.\n\n",

      "content": "In this, two sides are not equal but still have equal visual weight.  Dark colours give an effect of more weight than light colours.  They should be centred low in  the  arrangement.   Lighter  colours  give  an  impression  of  lightness  and  are more suitable towards the outer and upper ends of arrangement.\n\nScale: It  means proportion and relationship of the various parts of the composition. The plant material has to be in proportion with the container used and the sealing of the plant items with each other must be kept in mind along with the site and function. A flower arrangement is of good proportion when it is of right side for the container and placement.\n\nRhythm: Rhythm can be described as a sense of movement, which flows through the main lines of the arrangement.  The purpose of it is to direct once eyes along it so that the  shape  of  the  entire  composition  is  followed  and  understood.   In  flower arrangement  this  is  achieved  by  grading  flowers  and  arranging  foliage,  leaning towards the sides.  These lines partly decide the design of arrangement.\n\nFocal  Point: It  is  the  central  point  of  arrangement  where  emphasis  is  obtained  by large accented flowers, group of flowers or use of darker colours.\n\nHarmony  and  Unity: Ensure  that  the  materials  are  suitable  for  the  site  and  the occasion.  The colours of the flowers and the container should blend with each other easily or provide a pleasing contrast with each other and with the background.  Unity of  materials  is  necessary  to  view  the  arrangement  without  any  distraction  from  the main line of movement.\n\n",

      "content": "Mechanics : These are items used to keep flowers, foliage, and stems in place within the container. Mechanics must be fixed securely and should be hidden from view. Examples - florists' foam (oasis), pin holders (Japanese term - kenzan), chicken wire,\n\nprong, adhesive clay and tape, florist cone.\n\nFloral foam ,  also called oasis ,  is  a  cellular plastic material, available in two types green foam and brown/grey foam.\n\nPin-holders ,  also  called kenzan  or  needle-point  holders ,  is  a  series  of  sharply pointed  pins  are  firmly  held  in  a  solid  lead  base,  to  hold  thick  and  heavy  stems securely by impaling them on the pins.\n\nChicken wire, also called 'wire mesh' or 'wire netting' , is a fine- gauge wire used to cover floral foam blocks in large displays.\n\nProng is  the  simplest type of floral foam anchor. It is a small plastic disc with four vertical prongs. The base of the prong is attached to the container with adhesive clay and the floral foam is pressed down onto the prongs.\n\nFlorist's cone, also called a ‗ flower tube' or ‗ flower funnel' . It acts like a miniature vase.  It  is  used  in  large  arrangements,  where  foliage  or  flowers  need  to  be  placed above their stem height.\n\nEquipment :  This  includes  tools  used  to  ensure  t  hat  a  satisfactory  arrangement  of plant material is created within the container.\n\nExamples - bucket, scissors, knife, watering can, mister, wire cutter, cocktail sticks, turn, wire, floral tape, candle holder, cut flower preservatives, and secateurs.\n\nMister: It is a hand- held spray bottle to produce a fine mist of water droplets to keep an arrangement look fresh in warm weather.\n\nSecateurs: They are used to cut through thick and woody stems Cocktail sticks or a tooth pick: It is used to make holes in florists' foam for a soft stem of flower.\n\nCut-flower preservatives: It is  a  bactericide,  available in powder or liquid form, to prevent slime and smell from developing in the vase water, plus sugar to prolong the life of fresh flowers. A preservative can be made in-house by adding 3 teaspoons of sugar and 1 drop of bleach to half a litre of water.\n\nContainers: These  are  receptacles  that  hold  the  flower  arrangement.  They  may  or may  not  be  hidden  by  the  plant  material.  The  container  must  be  waterproof   and neutral  colours  such  as  soft  grey,  dull  brown,  off-white,  or  earth  colours  are  most suitable  because  they  are  inconspicuous  and  do  not  detract  attention  from  flowers displayed. Theme and simplicity should be kept in mind while choosing the design of the container.\n\nExample - vases and jugs, basket, bowls and trays, wreath frame etc.\n\nBases: An object that is placed underneath the container to protect the surface of the support and/or to add to the beauty of the display is called a base.\n\nExample - table mat, tree section, wood base, stone base, and oriental base.\n\nSupport: This refers to the structure on which the container stands.\n\nExample - tables, sideboards, alcoves, and shelves.\n\nOther equipments: Florists tape, foam, water spray, rubber bands, tooth picks, thin wire, rocks, pebbles, accessories like birds, butter flies, figurines, sheds etc. A sink, running water and working surface with storage area must be provided.\n\nPLANT MATERIALS : These can be divided into 3 basic types-\n\nFlowers (dominant/ focal/ point material ) : This consists of bold flowers or clusters of small showy blooms. The dominant material provides a centre of interest.\n\nExample  -  Gerbera,  Chrysanthemum,  lilies,  Anthurium,  Tulips,  Poppies,  Roses, Dahlias, and Daffodils.\n\nFillers (secondary material ) : This consists of smaller flowers and all sorts of leaves and foliage that are used to cover the mechanics and edges of the container and also provide added interest and colour to the display.\n\nExample  -  Asters,  Ivy,  Button  Chrysanthemum,  Carnations,  Gypsophila  (Baby's breath), Limonium and Marguerites.\n\nFoliages ( line material ) : This consists of tall stems, flowering spikes, or bold leaves that  are  used  to  create  the  basic  framework  or  skeleton.  This  line  material  may  be straight or curved and it sets the height and width of the finished arrangement.\n\nExamples - Gladioli, birds of paradise, golden rods, larkspur, asparagus ferns, palms, tuberoses, and Peruvian lilies.\n\nAccessories: These  are  non-plant  materials  included  in  or  placed  alongside  the arrangement. Their purpose in generally decorative but could be functional at times. Accessories are added to the design for extra interest or to ‗stretch' the flowers when they are in short supply.\n\nExample - miniature dolls, hats, ribbons, beads, painted wire,  wooden  fruit shapes, silk flowers and foliage, candles, driftwood, shells, idols, interesting pebbles etc.\n\nCare  and  conditioning  of  flowers: A flower  or  leaf  cut  from  a  plant  has  a  short, though beautiful, life. It is possible to prolong this for a little while by a few methods. Flower arrangers use the term ‗ conditioning ' to refer to the preparation of cut plant materials for a long life, the filling of stems with water, and prevention of wilting.\n\n",

The basic feature of a line design is limited use of plant material with support often provided by a pin holder.\n\nTriangular shape : It is a popular shape for symmetrical arrangements. The first step is to establish lines of height and width, usually with flowers or foliage of finer form or  paler  colour.  The  next  step  is  to  establish  a  focal  point  of  interest  with  large  or darker-colored flowers. Fill in with flowers of varied stem lengths, grouping colours.

It  is  a  low  arrangement,  symmetrical  and  thus attractive from every angle.\n\nHogarth or 'S' shape : This style was pioneered by an 18 th century painter, William Hogarth.  This  is  a  very  graceful  and  easier  to  make  arrangement  when  curved branches and pliable stems are used. After establishing the S shape with these, flowers are filled in at the centre and just above and below the rim of the tall container.\n\nDifferent shapes of flower arrangement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIKEBANA (Japanese/  Oriental  flower  arrangement ): The  word  literally  means ‗ making flowers live' in  Japanese.  This  Japanese  style  has  been  practiced  for thousands of years. These arrangements are more than an aesthetic grouping of plant materials. They are symbolic representations of an ideal harmony that exists between earthly and eternal life. In each arrangement, there is an imaginary triangle. Its tallest line  represents  ‗heaven'.  Facing  and  looking  towards  heaven  is  ‗man'.  The  lowest line, looking up to both, is ‗earth'. In all such arrangements, Heaven, man and earth are represented by means of three main branches.\n\nShin : The main spray, is the tallest and symbolizes heaven; it ends to the central axis of the vase. This stem should be 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the height of the container.\n\nSee: The second highest stem represents man. It provides width to the arrangement and is about three-fourth the height of the tallest spray. This stem forms an angle of about 45 degree with the rim of the container.\n\nHikae :  The  lowest  spray  denotes  earth.  This  branch  is  about  half  as  tall  as  the  one signifying man and extends very little beyond the diameter of the container, forming an angle of about 115 degrees with the rim of the container. It is placed opposite the branch signifying man and is used to balance the arrangement.\n\n",

In most five star hotels, one can see huge, spectacular arrangements in the lobbies. Restaurants generally have bud vases on each table, with one or two flowers in them.

      "content": "Fine  Abrasives: These  include  precipitated  whiting  (filtered  chalk)  and  jeweler's rouge  (a  pink  oxide  of  iron)  used  for  shining  silver.  They  are  also  constituents  of commercial silver polishes.\n\nMedium abrasives :  these  include  rotten  stone,  salt,  scouring  powder  and  scouring paste.  Scouring  powders  are  made  up  of  fine  particles  of  pumice  mixed  with  soap/ detergent, and alkali and a little bleach.\n\nHard / coarse abrasives :  these  include  bath  bricks,  sandpaper,  pumice,  steel  wool, and emery paper. Glass paper, calcite, sandpaper, fine ash, emery powder and paper, jeweler's  rouge,  powdered  pumice,  precipitated  whiting  (filtered  chalk).  Ground limestone, sand, steel wool and nylon scourers are some commonly used abrasives. Abrasives are usually not used alone in cleaning agents. For example, a cream or paste meant for cleaning utensils contain about 80 % of finely ground limestone, along with other  substances  such  as  bleaches,  anionic  surfactants,  alkaline  builders,  and\n\nperfumes.\n\nDegreasing  agents: They  usually  consist  of  strong  alkalis,  which  can  dissolve proteins and emulsify and disperse grease and similar substance. They are based on caustic  soda  or  sodium  met  silicate.  Sodium  carbonate  (washing  soda)  can  also  be used.  They  are  basically  used  as  stain  removers  and  for  clearing  blocked  drains, cleaning ovens and other industrial equipment. Extreme care should be taken in their use as they have high pH.\n\nAcids and toilet cleansers: Cleaning agents with acidic properties react with watersoluble chemical deposits to produce water-soluble salts. Acids dissolve metals and are  hence  used  to  remove  metal  stains  such  as  water  stains  in  baths,  hard  water deposits  around  taps,  tarnish  on  silver,  copper  and  brass,  etc. Weak acids include citric  acid (lemon  juice),  acetic  acid  (vinegar).  They  are  used  for  removing  tarnish from copper and brass and mild water stains in baths. Strong acids are oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulphuric acid.\n\nTable 4.1 Acid and their use\n\nAcids can cause further staining on metals if it is not washed off quickly, and may spoil the glaze on sanitary fitments. Toilet cleansers rely on their acid content to clean and  keep  the  W/C  pan  hygienic  and  remove  metal  stains.  They  can  be  crystalline, powdered  or  liquid. Powdered  toilet cleanser  consists  of  a  soluble  acidic  powder, chlorinated  bleach,  finely  ground  abrasive  (to  help  when  a  brush  is  used)  and  an effervescing  substance,  which  helps  to  spread  the  active  ingredient  throughout  the water. Liquid toilet cleansers are a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, and should be used with great care, because the concentration may cause damage to the surface of the pan, it's surrounding areas, and to the person using it (if the liquid is spilt).\n\nAlkalis: These are used as cleaning agents in the form of liquids and powders. They are particularly useful in the laundry. Very strong alkalis should be used with utmost caution as they are corrosive and toxic. These are called caustic alkalis. Many alkalis act as bleaches. Caustic soda- based cleaning agents are used to clear blocked drains and to clean ovens and other industrial equipment.\n\nTable 4.2 Alkalis and their use\n\nOrganic solvents: These are chemicals that dissolve fat, oil, grease, wax or similar compounds  from  different  surface,  e.g.  methylated  spirit,  white  spirit  (turpentine substitute), carbon tetrachloride. The former two are highly inflammable while carbon tetrachloride is harmful if inhaled, and hence should never be used in a closed area. Many are used for routine stain removal. They are harmful to skin and some surfaces and are fire hazardous.\n\n",

In general, the finer, softer bristles are best for smooth and hard surfaces. The harder the bristles, the  softer  the  surface  on  which  the  brush  should  be  used,  exception  being  toilet brushes and brushes found on all-purpose flour machines. Bristles, if not maintained properly, have a tendency to bend, splay or fall out of  the stock. Bristles should be closely set in tufts and the stock well covered with tufts.\n\nHead stock: This  is  the  part  of  the  brush  into  which  the  bristles  are  inserted.

Detachable  handles must be fixed firmly in place on the stock when the brush is in use.\n\nTypes of brushes : Three main types of brushes are used for cleaning surfaces. Hard brushes: Hard  brushes  have  bristles  that  are  fairly  stiff  and  well  spaced  out. They are most suitable for the removal of heavy soil and litter from carpets and for cleaning rough surfaces.\n\nSoft brushes: Soft brushes have bristles that are fairly flexible and set close together. These help to remove loose soil and litter on hard, smooth surfaces. Such brushes may be designed to dust carpets and furniture, too, especially those made of cane, wicker and bamboo.\n\nScrubbing brushes: Scrubbing brushes have short, coarse bristles designed for use on surfaces  that  have  become  stained  and  heavily  ingrained  with  dirt.  These  brushes should  only  be  used  to  remove  stubborn,  heavy  soiling  from  small  areas  that  are difficult  for  a  scrubbing  machine to  access.

Depending on the type, brooms may be used for removing dust or dirt in large areas.\n\nTypes of brooms: As with brushes, brooms may be classified into 3 main categories:\n\nSoft-bristled brooms: Soft bristled brooms such as corn-fibre brooms, grass brooms and whisk brooms are used on smooth floors. A good soft broom has comparatively fewer split ends and any splits that do form are short.\n\nHard/Coarse-bristled  brooms: Brooms  such  as  yard  brooms  and  coconut  fibre brooms are used on course surfaces, especially outdoors.\n\nWall brooms: These are also called ceiling brooms or Turk's heads. They have a soft head  and  long  handle,  usually  made  of  cane.  These  brooms  are  used  to  remove cobwebs as well as dust from cornices, ceilings and high ledges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCare and cleaning of brooms: Brooms should be shaken free of dust and fluff. Never store them standing on their bristles, or the bristles will bend out of shape, resulting in inefficient  cleaning.  Store  brooms  either  lying  horizontally  or  hanging  bristles downward. Never use soft brooms on wet surfaces. Stiff brooms such as coconut-fibre brooms  can  be  used  on  wet  surfaces  but  must  be  cleaned  afterward  thoroughly  in saline water and dried in the sun before cleaning.\n\nBox Sweepers: These are also called carpet sweepers and are used for sweeping up\n\ndust  and  litter  from  soft  floor  coverings  as  well  as rugs  and  carpets.  They  are  ideal  for  the  removal  of spills and for light cleaning of small carpeted areas. A box sweeper consists of a friction brush that revolves\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwhen the equipment is pushed manually over the carpet bottom to facilitate emptying after use. Choose sweepers with a wide base that is low enough to be pushed under furniture and that will clean close to a wall. In sweepers meant to clean hard floors as well as soft floor coverings, the brush can be lowered to the floor to sweep.\n\nCare and cleaning of box sweepers : The friction brush should be kept clean; else the efficiency of the equipment will be seriously impaired. After the cleaning process, the dustpans should be emptied of all the collected dust.\n\n",

      "content": "Basically they are of two types\n\nDry Mops: Also called dust control mops, these are designed to remove  soil  and  debris  from  floors,  walls  and  ceilings  without raising  and  dissipating  dust.  These  mops  generally  consist  of  a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhandle to which a metal frame is attached. The mop head is either inserted into the frame or stretched over it, according to the type.\n\nTypes of dry mops: There are 4 principle types of dry mops.\n\nMops  with  impregnated  fringes: These  mops  consist  of  dense  cotton  fringes, approximately  15  cm  in  length,  inserted  into  a  metal  frame  of  15-120  cm  length. These mops are usually pre-impregnated or will require impregnation by soaking in or spraying with mineral oil or a synthetic impregnating fluid. The dust is held onto the mops by the oil.\n\nImpregnated mop sweepers: These mops consist of a double-hinged frame and are thus  called  ‗V-sweepers'  of  ‗scissor-action  sweepers'.  The  mops  can  be  preimpregnated or may require impregnation before each use. Following impregnation, sufficient time must be allowed for the mineral oil to cure the fibres; else the mop will leave a film of oil on the cleaned surface due to improper curing. To be effective, an impregnated mop must also be manoeuvred correctly.  It should be worked in long, even  strokes  in  a  continual  movement,  keeping  the  mop  head  in  contact  with  the surface  all  the  time.  This  way,  maximum  dust  collection  and  minimum  dust dissipation is ensured.\n\nStatic  mops: These  mops  consist  of  acrylic,  nylon  or  polyester  strands  fixed  to  a backing stretched over a metal frame. When in use, the fringes splay out to form a large  surface  area,  holding  dust  by  means  of  a  static  charge  that  builds  up  on  the fringe. Static mops are more easily maintained than impregnated mops.\n\nDisposable mops: These  mops consist  of  a  handle  with  a  soft  pad  at  the  end,  onto which  a  cheap  cotton  or  synthetic  material  is  affixed.  The  material  has  properties enabling it to attract and hold dust. The fabric is held in place by clips or a special tape and is usually\n\nCare and cleaning of dry mops: Shake mops well after use outdoors. The mop head should  be  easily  detachable  so  they  can  be  frequently  washed  in  hot  water  with detergent. The use of soap-free detergent will prevent the formation of scum that clogs the fibres of the head. The mop must be worked up and down in at least 2 changes of clean, hot water. The clean mop should then be tightly squeezed out, shaken well to get rid of excess moisture and left to dry in open air. Once dry, the mops may need to be re-impregnated.\n\n",

They are available in weights ranging from 330g to 670g. The strands may be stitched together or unstitched. The former are less likely to tangle, can be laundered more easily and\n\nare likely to last longer than unstitched mops.\n\nFoss  mops: These  consist  of  a  dense  cotton  fringe  inserted into a heavy metal stock. They are available in a wide range of weights.\n\nSponge  mops: These  consist  of  cellulose  sponge  fixed  to  a replaceable,  lever-controlled  head,  hinged  for  wringing  out and attached to a long handle. Using a sponge mop is one of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe easiest ways to wash a hard floor. Short handled sponge mops are also available for cleaning windows.\n\nSqueegee: A  squeegee  consists  of  a  long  metallic  handle  and  a  wooden  or  rubber blade  to  remove  excess  water  from  a  surface  being  cleaned  It  is  effective  when followed  by  mopping  with  a  damp  mop.  A  smaller  version  called  the  window squeegee is used for wiping away water from windows after washing.\n\nCare and cleaning of damp mops: Take mops outdoors after use and shake well to remove excess  moisture.  Then  these  mops  may  be  washed  in  the  same  way  as  dry mops. Detachable heads are easier to clean and maintain. However, drying is the most important part of mop care as bacteria require moisture to multiply. A disinfectant to discourage their growth is effective only for a short period of time, so leaving them damp means letting germs breed. Damp mops should be renewed as soon as there are signs  of  wear.  They  should  be  stored  in  such  a  way  that  air  is  allowed  to  circulate around the mop head. Never use disinfectant or bleach with a cellulose sponge head. Wash and rinse sponge heads after use, squeeze out excess water and dry well. Store the sponge head by hanging.\n\n",

Dusters must  be  folded  several  times  into  a  hand-sized  pad  before  use  so  as  to  provide  a number of clean surfaces and avoid spreading dirt again to a clean surface instead.\n\nSwabs  and  wipes: These  are  all-purpose  cloths  made  of  soft,  absorbent  material. They are used for wet cleaning and damp dusting of all surfaces above floor level. They are  also  used  for  cleaning  sanitary  fittings  such  as  bathtubs  and  wash  basins. Wipes include loosely woven or knitted cotton cloths and non-woven cloths. Synthetic sponges may also be grouped under this category. They are available in various sizes and shapes. Sponges are better than cloths for washing walls, woodwork, glass and upholstery.\n\nFloor cloths: Floor cloths are bigger, thicker and made of coarser cotton material than all-purpose swabs. They are used to wipe WC pedestals and remove spills from floors.\n\nScrim: This  is  a  loosely  woven  linen  material  resembling  fine  sackcloth.  Scrim, because of its high absorbency and lint-free nature, is often used instead of chamois leather for cleaning windows and mirrors.\n\nGlass cloths: Glass  cloths  are  made  up  of  linen  tow  yarns  and  do  not  leave  behind lint. They can therefore be used for wiping mirrors and drinking glasses. These must not be confused with fabrics made from glass fibres (glasscloth).\n\nRags  and  polishing  cloths: Rags  are  disposable  cloths  usually  obtained  from  the sewing room or bought by the sack from tailors. They are used for applying polish or strong cleaning agents are disposed off when dirty. Polishing cloths need to have a fleecy napped surface and pieces of flannel are ideal.\n\nWet cloths: Wet cloths need to be very absorbent and of a manageable size, so that they  can  be  wrung  out  by  hand  easily  during  cleaning.  They  are  used  for  mopping large floor areas.\n\nChamois leather: Real chamois leather is the skin of the chamois goat antelope, but now various  cheaper imitations  are  available.  These  simulated  chamois  leathers  are usually skivers, that is, split sheepskin. Chamois leather can be used wet for cleaning windows and mirrors; when dry; it is used as a polishing cloth for silver and other metals. It is also ideal for wiping squeegee blades.\n\nDust sheets: Dust sheets are made of any thin cotton material, being about the size of a single sheet. Discarded bed sheets or curtains from the linen room are ideal for use as dust sheets. They are used to cover floors, furniture or other articles during spring cleaning or decorating.\n\nDruggets: These are made up of coarse linen, fine canvas or clear plastic. They may be the size of a carpet square or runner. They are placed on the floor in doorways to prevent  excessive  dirt  being  tracked  in  or  out  during  bad  weather  and  during redecorating projects. They are sometimes placed in the passage between the kitchen and dining area to catch spills and debris.\n\nHearth and bucket cloths: These are made up of thick fabrics and used to protect the carpet  and  flooring  when  a  fireplace  is  being  cleaned  or  placed  under  buckets  to prevent marks on the surface they are kept on. They also catch splashes of water. Care and cleaning of cloths: Good care of cloths is important for efficient cleaning and longer life. Care and cleaning recommendations for various types of cloths are given in Table 7.1.\n\nTable 4.3: Cloth care & cleaning recommendations\n\nCONTAINERS: Work  becomes  much  easier  and  efficient  if  the  staff  is  given appropriate containers in which to carry, transport, collect and store supplies and other items.\n\nBuckets: These may be made of plastic or galvanised iron. Plastic buckets are more popular  these  days  as  they  are  lighter  in  weight,  quieter  to  use  and  easier  to  clean. Buckets to be used with mops may have one or two sections and may have a wringer device that can be detached for easy cleaning.\n\n",

Dustpans with long handles that eliminate stooping are ideal.\n\nDustbins: These bins may be made of plastic or wood. Some properties also use jute or wicker bins. Individual dustbins in guestrooms may be lined with a disposable inner lining made of recycled paper or plastic. These bins must be emptied and wiped daily. They should be washed once a week.\n\nSani-bins: These are metal or plastic bins with lids. They are found in toilets for the collection of soiled sanitary towels.

It is essential that the nozzle is properly adjusted and free from any blockage. The nozzle must be kept clean,  by  spraying  clean,  pure  water  through  it  after  every use.\n\nPolish applicator trays: These are used in conjunction with a polish  applicator  mop  for  polishing  floors  with  a  liquid polish.

It is like a giant tool  box; stocked with everything necessary to service a guestroom effectively such carts available are now made  of  metal,  but  sometimes  wooden  carts  may  be  in  use.  The  cart  should  be spacious enough to carry all the supplies needed for a GRA to complete half a day's room assignments. Since the cart is large and may be heavily loaded, it must be easily manoeuvrable as well. The ideal cart would have fixed wheels at one end and castorwheels at the other. The cart should be well organised so that the GRAs do not have to waste time in searching for supplies or make frequent trips back to the supply room. Also if the cart is not stacked neatly, it will look very unsightly when in the guests' view. There is usually one such cart for each room section and it is stored in the floor pantry along with other housekeeping supplies.\n\nJanitor's  trolley: This  is  used  for  carting  and  storing  cleaning  supplies.  It  is  used during  the  cleaning  of  public  areas  or  any  special  cleaning  projects  scheduled  for guestrooms. It includes a detachable trash bag and a place for storing cleaning agents and small pieces of cleaning equipment.\n\nMop-wringer trolley: This  piece  of  equipment  consists  of  a  mop  and  one  or  twin buckets with an attached wringer, all mounted on a trolley with caster wheels. It may have provision for holding cleaning agents as well as a trash bag.\n\nLinen trolley: These are used for the transfer of clean linen from the laundry to the linen room or from the linen room to the floor pantries and so on. Linen trolleys may be made of aluminium or steel.\n\nLaundry  sacks: These,  in  fact,  may  or  may  not  be  mobile  (and  hence  may  not necessarily  be  trolleys).  They  may  be  made  of  wicker,  fibreglass  or  plastic.  A  very popular choice is the one made of tough cotton with drawstrings, as it can be washed frequently.\n\nCleaning and care of trolleys: All  carts  and  trolleys  need  to  be  kept  clean,  wiped daily  and  stored  in  a  locked,  dry,  well-ventilated  area  when  not  in  use.  A  thorough cleaning may be done once a week. The wheels may be oiled during this cleaning. Carts or trolleys should never become general dumping grounds when not in use.\n\n",

      "content": "The various pieces of mechanical equipment used in the housekeeping department are usually powered by electricity or gas. The staff should be well-trained in the operation of these equipments since incorrect usage will not only lead to inefficient cleaning but may also become a safety hazard.\n\nVacuum cleaners/ Suction cleaners: Vacuum cleaners remove debris and soil and/or water  from  a  surface  by  suction.  All  vacuum  cleaners  work  on  the  same  operating principle. In all types, motor drives an impeller, which sucks in air through an inlet, creating a difference in pressure between the air within and outside the machine. Air drawn in from the inlet passes through and out of the machine. Air drawn in from the inlet passes through and out of the machine. Usually the air is sucked in together with soil,  debris  or  water.  The  dust  is  collected  into  a  container  provided,  which  may  be within  the  body  of  the  machine  (as  in  cylindrical  and  canister  models)  or  on  the outside in the form of a bag (as in upright models). The dust-collecting apparatus in the heavy duty models used in hotel properties usually consists of 2 types of dust bags. The inner bag is made of disposable paper and the outer one is made of fabric.\n\nTypes of vacuum cleaners: Various types of vacuum cleaners are available.\n\nDry vacuum cleaners :  These are used for removing dust and small pieces of debris from floors, upholstery, furnishings, walls and ceilings. Those using a flexible hose come  with  attachments,  such  as  a  floor-cleaning  head,  a  power  head,  a  crevicecleaning head, an upholstery-cleaning head, a dusting head and extension tubes.Many variations of the dry vacuum cleaner are in use:\n\nElectric brooms: These are very lightweight vacuums without a motor-driven beater brush. They are used only for light vacuuming and for touch-ups on carpets and hard floors. In other words, they come in handy when a full vacuuming is required.\n\nDustettes: These are small, lightweight vacuum cleaners used for cleaning curtains, upholstery edges, mattresses, computers and music systems. They clean by brushing and suction and are very easy to handle. The may be carried in hand or strapped to the back of the operator.\n\nBackpack vacuums: These are very efficient to clean high, hard-to-reach areas. The vacuum  unit  in  these  machines  can  easily  be  strapped  to  the  back  of  the  operator. These  machines  have  hand-held  wands  that  come  with  various  attachments  for flexibility in cleaning. They are ideal for use on curtains, drapes and ceiling corners. These vacuums are also referred to as piggyback vacuums.\n\nUpright vacuums: These vacuums are the ones more frequently seen in hotels. The main body of the vacuum lies horizontal on the floor and is driven by a single motor. The dust-bag is outside the machine's main body. There is a belt-driven beater brush to facilitate removal of dust from thick-pile carpets. In an improved variation, there is a dual-motor system - one motor drives the beater brush and the other provides the suction. The machine also has a built-in hose for cleaning corners and upholstery. This machine is most suitable for use on large carpeted areas.\n\nCylindrical vacuums: These have no rotating brushes and work by suction only. The term ‗suction cleaner' is generally used for these kinds of vacuum cleaners. A filtercum-diffuser is fitted at the outlet which removes fine dust and micro-organisms from the  flow  of  air  passing  through  the  outlet.  The  filter-cum-diffuser  also  reduces  air disturbance  and  noise.  The  dust-bag  is  inside  the  cylindrical  body  of  the  vacuum cleaner. A flexible hose along with the different attachments is used to clean a variety of surfaces. These are the type commonly used by GRAs in guestroom cleaning.\n\nPile-lifter  vacuums: These  vacuum  cleaners  are  used  to  groom  long-pile  carpets. They lift  up  the  carpet  pile  that  has  become  packed  down  and  restore  their  vertical orientation. It is especially useful before shampooing the carpet, more so if the soiling is heavy.\n\nFig4.4 different types of vacuum cleaners\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCentralized  vacuum: In  this  type  of  unit,  suction  is  generated  at  one  point  in  the building. Meanwhile, soiling can be removed at vacuum points somewhere else in the building by suitable nozzles connected to detachable flexible hoses. The collected dirt is then conveyed by a network of pipes to a central container. This unit is expensive to install and is generally done at the building construction stage. The advantages of this kind of system are :\n\nWet-and-dry vacuum  cleaners :  These  are  extremely  useful  in  hotel  housekeeping operations.  They  can  pick  up  spills  and  excess  wash  water  when  on  the  wet  mode. When  on  the  dry  mode,  they  help  in  removal  of  dust  and  debris.  In  hotels,  these machines are usually used in their wet mode to pick up spills. They are also required when  large  areas  of  floors  are  being  stripped  of  polish  and  cleaned.  They  have  a flexible hose with attachments such as a squeegee head. The waste water collects in a tank  that  needs  to  be  emptied  after  use.  A  variation  of  this  is  the  large  tank-type vacuum cleaners.  These  are  also  called  canister-type  or  industrial  vacuum  cleaners. They can be used for dry and wet pick-up or both. The waste water is scooped up by a squeegee attachment through a nozzle and travels back into the tank. They are used for cleaning large areas when time is a constraint. They are ideal for cleaning lobbies, banquet halls and restaurants.\n\nFig4.5 Dry and wet vacuum Cleaner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCare and storage: Vacuum cleaners will  give  maximum  cleaning  efficiency  when they  are  maintained  well.  Housekeeping  staff  need  to  be  trained  in  the  care  and maintenance  of  the  machines.  The  wheels  of  the  machine  need  to  be  oiled periodically. After use, the dust bags should be checked and emptied. If the machine is operated with the dust bags full, cleaning will not be operated, the machine may heat up too much and the bags may get damaged. Wipe the casing daily and check the hose and flex before use. Clean the attachment heads after each use. Check the filter after\n\nuse.  If  the  machine  is  meant  for  dry suction only, never use it to clear even a little amount of water, else the dust bags will  get  damaged.  In  case  of  wet vacuums, the bucket should be washed, rinsed  and  dried.  The  squeegee  should be  wiped  clean  and  replaced  whenever necessary. The hose needs to be rinsed out,  the  casing  and  wheels  wiped  and the filter checked after use. The wheels need  oiling  periodically.  The  hoses should be stored hanging on hooks. The tubes  and  attachment  heads  of  a  dry vacuum  cleaner  should  be  stored  in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nboxes, drawers of shelves. The hoses and attachment heads of wet vacuum cleaners should be stored off the ground on a rack, in a well-ventilated place\n\n",

      "content": "To  regulate  the  quality  of  pewter,  oversight  organizations  were  formed  to standardize the metal's composition into a number of purity grades. The techniques used to fashion pewter grew more varied as time passed as metalworkers developed finishes that could be applied over any grade of pewter to dramatically changed its appearance.  Identifying  the  grade  and  finish  of  a  pewter  piece  is  the  first  step  in determining the best cleaning method to use.\n\nTable4.4 types of finishes on Pewter\n\nPewter Finishes: Pewter objects often have a finish applied which could be one of three types:\n\nPolished  finish :  Polished  pewter  is  the  most  common  and  has  a  smooth,  shiny surface which can withstand more frequent cleaning than satin or oxidized finishes.\n\nSatin  finish :  Satin  pewter  has  a  rough,  grainy  appearance  with  a  dull  sheen  that should not be removed to brighten the look of the piece.\n\nOxidized finish .  Oxidized pewter has a darkening solution applied to it to achieve an aged look intentionally.\n\nPewter  Care  and  cleaning: Preventative  measures  should  be  implemented whenever  handling  pewter  to  prevent  damage  or  staining.  Pewter  has  a  very  low melting point of 450 degrees Fahrenheit, so never place pewter items in the oven, on a heat source like a hot plate or stove, or near an open flame. Acids and sulfur can cause pitting or staining on pewter, so foods with high levels of acid or sulfur, like citrus, eggs, or salad dressings, should be washed off pewter items immediately after use. Washing pewter by hand is preferred over using a dishwasher.\n\nPolished Pewter: Polished pewter is a popular finish because it is very smooth and shiny.  This  reflectiveness,  however,  also  makes  this  finish  vulnerable  to  scratches and the appearance of dust or grime. Of the three types of pewter finishes, polished pewter is the one that requires the most cleaning.\n\nSatin  Finish  Pewter: Routine  cleaning  consists  of  washing  the  pewter  piece  in warm water with a mild dish soap and a sponge. Once a year, however, it could be put through a thorough cleaning process that includes using very fine steel wool to get  rid  of  any  dust  or  grime.  Start  off  with  washing  the  pewter  piece  with  warm water,  a  sponge,  and  mild  dish  soap,  then  dry  completely.  Buff  the  surface  of  the pewter lightly with the steel wool, making sure to rub in the direction of the pewter's grain, until the whole piece has been covered. Rinse the piece again in warm water and dry with a soft towel.\n\nOxidized Pewter: Oxidized pewter pieces, which have a dark finish, are the easiest pieces  to  clean.  Simply  wash  with  warm  water  and  mild  dish  detergent  using  a sponge. Dry with a soft cloth when finished.\n\n",

It can be bent to any shape during manufacture and may have as many as nine piles. It's very strong and maybe covered with plastic laminate or a hardwood veneer.\n\nChipboard - It  is  used  extensively for  worktops, wardrobes, chests of drawers, etc. and nearly always has a wood veneer or plastic laminate. It is heavy and strong but flexible. It is made by mixing wood chips with a synthetic resin adhesive.\n\nHardboard -  It  is  more  flexible  than  chipboard  and  much  thinner.  Made  from compressed brown fireboard, it is smooth on one side with a mesh texture on other. Hardboard is used as a backing for wardrobes, base of drawers, door panels, backing for pictures, base for floor tiles, etc.\n\nBlock boards - This consists of strips of wood between veneers. The inner strips of wood  are  fairly  thick  (up  to  30  mm)  making  it  a  strong  material  usually  used  for making shelves and table tops.\n\nWood products are nearly always faced with a plastic laminate, sun mica, Formica or wood veneer.

      "content": "Unprotected wood surfaces will absorb moisture, which causes the grains to swell and so creates gap into which dirt and germs can fall and become trapped when it dries. Liquids  such  as  coffee  and  wine  leave  a  stain  on  the  surface,  which  is  difficult  to remove, and scratching is difficult to avoid, particularly on floors. The following are the  most  commonly  found  methods  of  protection  and  maybe  referred  to  as wood finishes .\n\nCellulose lacquer - This is fairly durable matt applied to solid timber furniture during manufacture. It should be dusted and wiped with a damp cloth and then dried with a soft one. Cream or spray polish may be applied to give a gloss finish. Heat, water and solvents will cause damage.\n\nFrench  polish -  This  is  also  easily  damaged  by  heat,  water  and  solvents. Deterioration  is  caused  by  light  and  atmosphere  in  general.  French  polishing  is produced by rubbing the solid wooden surface with a solution of Shellac (a dark red resin) and methylated spirits. It should be dusted daily and polished in the way of the grain.  Occasionally  cream,  liquid  or  paste  polish  maybe  applied  to  remove  light soiling and improve the gloss.\n\nOil -  Solid  wooden  furniture  can  be  given  a  matt  protective  finish  by  rubbing  the surface with a mixture of oil (usually linseed oil) and resin. This process gives very\n\nlittle protection although it will help to reduce the absorption of water. Daily dusting is essential. Marks can be removed by lightly rubbing with very fine steel wool. About twice  a  year  the  surface  should  be  rubbed  with  a  mixture  of  equal  quantities  of turpentine and raw linseed oil. Proprietary polishes should be avoided.\n\nPaint - This is very widely used on furniture, window frames, doorframes, skirting, staircase railings, etc. Gloss paint is tougher than matt or silk and will withstand more frequent washings. All painted wood surfaces should be dusted daily and wiped with a synthetic detergent solution or solvent weekly. Spray or cream polishes can be used to retain the shine or gloss on surfaces. Heat, alkalis and abrasives easily damage paint.\n\nResin  (varnish ) -  Natural  and  synthetic  resins  such  as  polyesters,  melamine  and polyurethane  are  used  extensively  on  wooden  furniture,  window  frames,  skirting, floors  and  staircases.  The  finish  maybe  glossy  or  matt  and  is  frequently  applied  to furniture made from chipboard. Resin is extremely tough and will resist heat, water, solvents and abrasives; but once damaged by scratching or chipping, it is very difficult to repair. Dusting should be done regularly. Cream or spray polish should be applied on glossy surface after damp wiping. Matt surface should be rubbed up occasionally using a mixture of 500ml turpentine, 100ml boiled linseed oil and 500ml vinegar.\n\nWax (bees wax) -  This  is  applied  on  solid  wood  surfaces.  It  provides  an  attractive finish,  exposing  the  pattern  of  the  wood,  but  is  easily  damaged  by  heat,  water  and solvents. Waxed surfaces should be dusted daily and cleaned weekly with cream and liquid polish.\n\n",

It is relatively cheap, easily applied and cleaned and can give a textured and multicolored effect. The only disadvantage is that it shows soils (especially for matt paints) and wall imperfections (in gloss paints) more readily than any other wall covering.\n\nPaints are typically mixture of four ingredients: pigments, additives, binders and solvents. Pigments are colors; additives give the paints the special properties such as resistance  to  rust  and  fungus.  Binders  hold  the  paints  together.  Solvents  enable  the brushing and rolling easier. Depending on the binders or vehicles used, paints can be broadly classified into two classes:\n\n",

Base, filler, coloring pigments, vehicle, solvent and dryer.\n\nThe base : it is generally metallic oxide in powered form and is chief constituent of the paints. They may be white lead, red lead, zinc oxide, iron oxide etc\n\nThe filler : Cheap pigments added to the paints to reduce its cost.\n\nColoring pigments : A white or coloring pigment mixed into to get desire shades.\n\nVehicle: It is liquid acts as binders for the various pigments.\n\nSolvent: It is a liquid that thins the consistency of the paints and evaporates when it applied to the surface so that it may solidify. Turpentine, pure oils, petroleum, spirit etc are used as solvent.\n\nDryer: one of the groups of materials containing metallic compounds that are used in small amounts for accelerating the drying of the paint film\n\nThe different types of solvent based paints available are:\n\nAlloy paints - They are based on synthetic resins combined with vegetable oil such as linseed oil. The conventional types were natural resins, which are still used in primers and  undercoat  paints.  Alloyed  paints  are  generally  easier  to  apply  and  have  better durability and wearing properties than any other type. Polyutherene and silicone are sometimes included to give more scratch resistant surface. They are available in gloss, silk and flat finishes.\n\nMulticolored paints - They are usually dispersions of cellulose colors in water. Each colour  is  present  in  separate  -blobs  -or  -spots‖.  The  resulting  effect  depends  on number  of  different  colors,  degree  of  contrast  between  them  and  the  size  and distribution  of  spots.  This  paint  should  be  applied  by  spraying.  It  is  extremely hardwearing and the multicolor effect helps in hiding irregularities and imperfections. It is usually applied on walls of corridors, sanitary accommodations, and similar areas, to  give  a  stain  and  abrasion  resistant  finish,  which  can  be  washed  and  cleaned regularly.\n\nTextured or Plastic paints - They are usually plaster based and are intended to give a  textured  or  relief  effect  on  surface.  The  texture  is  obtained  by  working  over  the material  after  application  and  while  it  is  still  wet,  using  combs,  palette,  knives, strippers, etc. Some are self-colored while others may require painting when they dry. The modern types are based on heavy-bodied synthetic resin  emulsion  and may be applied by spraying directly on the concrete or similar surfaces; thus eliminating the need of plaster.\n\nMicro porous paints - they have a rubberized base which gives little gloss but offers elasticity and allowing movement when the surface expands or contracts.\n\nAluminum paints Theses are use for painting wood and metal surface. Aluminum powder forms the base in this type of paint.\n\nAnti-corrosive  paints -  They  are  generally  used  as  metal-protection  paints  for preserving  metallic  structure  against  the  adverse  effect  of  whether  fumes,  corrosive chemicals, etc.\n\nBituminous paints -  They  are  also  used  for  waterproofing  and  protecting  iron  and steel. These paints usually consist of asphalt, bitumen and pitch dissolved in spirit or naphtha. These paints deteriorate when exposed on the direct rays of the sun.\n\nBronze  paints -  These  types  of  paints  is  used  for  painting  for  interior  or  exterior metallic surfaces. Aluminum bronze, copper powder is the pigment use in this types of paints.\n\nEnamel paints - This type of paint is made by adding pigments such as white lead or (Pb) or zinc white to a varnish. O drying, it forms a smooth glossy relatively hard and permanent  film  that  is  thin  but  solid.  These  paints  are  used  both  for  interior  and exterior.\n\nOil paints -  This  type  of  paint  can be used for almost all surfaces, from wood and masonry to metal fabrics.

They  referred  as  hard  floors  because  they  offer  no  resilience,  are  cold underfoot and noisy in comparison to other types of floors.

This floor can withstand large weights but is damaged by acids and alkalis. It is suitable for stores, sub-floors, laundry, staircase etc. Concrete is extremely porous, hard and soiled easily.  A scale may be applied to make it stain resistant.  These floors are suitable in halls, lounges, corridors, and bathrooms and as tabletops.\n\nGranolithic: it is hard floor finish of graded granite chips set in cement. It is used for basement  corridors,  storerooms,  stairways  and  laundry.  The  final  surface  is  hardwearing and its appearance is improved if the surface is polished. It is usually laid in tile form.\n\nTerrazzo: This is also a hard floor finish, consisting of a mixture of marble and other decorative  chipping  set  in  fine  cement  that  can  be  colored.  Marble  is  a  rock (limestone)  mainly  found  in  Italy,  and  maybe  white,  black,  green  or  brown.  When used as flooring it is laid in slabs. Marble is very expensive; terrazzo being only chips of  marble  is  much  cheaper.  To  prevent  slipperiness  self-polishing  emulsions  are applied. Terrazzo is used in foyers, cloakrooms and kitchens.\n\nCeramics: Ceramic tiles  are  made  of  clay  and  fired  at  high  temperature.   They  are hand  or  machine  made,  glazed  and  unglazed.  Shapes  of  the  tiles  may  be  square, rectangular  or  hexagonal.  Tiles  are  waterproof  and  impervious  to  cleaning  liquid. They are commonly used in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry, canteens, bars etc. These floors are hard, noisy and tire the feet.  Ceramic floors should not be polished since that would make it dangerously slippery.\n\nGlazed ceramic tile Glazed ceramic tiles are made from special ceramic clay in two operations  Biscuits  the  body  of  tile  is  made  and  fired  at  1200  To  1300  c  Glazed Biscuits are then coated with glazed, decorations etc.\n\nVitrified tile When Special Clay is mixed with quartz and feldspar and burned to very high temperatures.

This  word  ‗Vitrified  Tiles'  is  simply  a  type  tile  with  very  low  water\n\nabsorption.  And  this  property  makes  vitrified  tiles  acid/alkali/chemical  resistant, impairs a greater strength & makes it stain resistant.\n\nVitrified tile Full body vitrified tiles: This type of vitrified tiles has color all the way throughout  the  body  (thickness)  of  the  tile.  Because  of  this  scratches  are  less noticeable  in  this  type  of  tiles.  Full  body  vitrified  tiles  are  formed  with  the  paint mixture pre-added while making the body. It is called Glazed Vitrified Tiles (GVT). Main advantage with GVT is it offers option of making any type of design/art work that is only possible in this type of vitrified tiles.

Most  hardwood  floors  are  made  from  oak,  but  other  popular  woods include  ash,  beech,  birch,  hickory,  maple,  teak,  and  walnut.  In  addition  to  its attractiveness, hardwood floors are extremely durable if they are properly finished and maintained.  Unfinished wood floors will quickly deteriorate under even light use, as wood  is  an  extremely  porous  material.  Unfinished  woods  are  susceptible  to  dirt lodging in the grains, splintering of the wood fibers abrasions caused by normal foot traffic,  and  of  course,  moisture,  the  bane  of  wood  floors.  Too  much  moisture  will cause a wood floor to warp, while too little humidity will cause wood floors to shrink and  crack.  To  help  forestall  damage,  most  wood  floors  made  today  receive  factory applied finish. Tung oil and carnauba wax are then applied to seal the wood. Wood Floors  since  there  is  a  degree  of  resiliency  in  even  the  hardest  of  hardwood  floors, precautions should be taken to protect the floor from furniture legs that may dent the flooring. The types of wood flooring are outlined below:\n\nWood Parquet flooring: It is  a  floor  composed  of  short  strips  or  blocks  of  wood forming a pattern, sometimes with inlays of other woods or other materials. Parquet flooring is a series of wood flooring pieces that create a geometric design.  Parquet offers a variety of design options. Timber used for Parquet floor is Jati & Kempis.\n\nThese are made into tiles that can be used to stimulate wood parquet but are generally called ‗parquet' these days even when laid simply to resemble a board floor. Various ready-patterned tiles in herringbone, basket weave or strip are available. Plywood parquet tiles are not durable in areas of heavy wear. It is supplied in various\n\nPlywood: squares from 9inches to 3ft.\n\nHard wood strips: These are high-quality wood flooring made of hardwoods. A well maintained  hardwood  floor  improves  with  age.  Hardwood  blocks  vary  in  thickness from ¾ inch to 1 ¼ inch and the size may be up to 12 x 3 inches. The strips used are up to 4inches wide and are carved to have a tongue and groove.\n\nAsphalt tiles: they are composed of asbestos fibres, pigments, inert fillers, bound with asphalt in the case of a darker verities and with some other resinous binder in the case of lighter colors.\n\nBitumastic flooring: This is a joint less, low cost flooring and consist of a type of asphalt roll onto a sold sub floor in a hot plastic state. It is soft in texture, though the appearance is that of a hard floor. It is normally black, brown and red in colour. It is also used in as moisture-proof membrane to protect other flooring against dampness. Howe ever, it is damage by heat and heavy weigh\n\n",

      "content": "Linoleum: This is made up of lignum, i.e. flax and ileum in oil. Ground corkwood, linseed oil and resins (gum) are pressed on to jute backing.  This is prepared in sheet or tile form.  Linoleum may crack if laid on poor quality sub floor. It is hard wearing, resilient  and  warm,  but  may  peel,  rot  and  gets  destroyed  by  alkalis. The  thickness varies  from  2mm  to  6mm.  Linoleum  flooring  is  also  available  in  form  of  tiles. Linoleum  flooring  should  be  laid  over  an  effective  damp-proof  area.  Its  properties included in a remarkable degree of resiliency. Next to cork and rubber, and of course, padded  carpeting,  linoleum  is  considered  to  have  the  greatest  degree  of  resiliency. Linoleum was quite durable, was resistant to oil and grease, and do not shrink. The negative aspects of linoleum were that it is highly susceptible to water. The linoleum would absorb water and would then soften, causing it to lose its abrasion resistance and become more susceptible to indentation.\n\nRubber: Rubber floors are usually made by a combination of natural and synthetic rubber.  They may be laid in sheets or tile form.  They may be coloured and mottled with inlaid patterns.  The floor is hard wearing, resilient, quiet and waterproof.  It is non-slip  and  may  be  grease  resistant.   Damage  may  occur  due  to  alkalis,  acids  and spirits.  One major advantage is that they are quite resilient and will remain resilient over a considerable temperature range. They are not affected by mould, bacteria and pest  infestation.   It  is  commonly  used  in  kitchens,  bathrooms,  health  clubs,  near swimming pools etc. Rubber Floors All modern rubber floors are made from synthetic rubber\n\nsuch as styrene butadiene rubber (SBR). Rubber tiles are cured or vulcanized by the application  of  heat.  Rubber  floors  are  nonporous,  waterproof  surfaces.  Rubber flooring is susceptible to alkaline, oils, grease, solvents, ultraviolet light, and ozone in the air.\n\nVinyl Floors: There are several types of vinyl floorings and tiles. The major varieties include  vinyl  composition  tiles,  homogeneous  or  flexible  vinyl  tiles,  and  laminated vinyl flooring. Laminated vinyl flooring is less expensive to manufacture than vinyl composition  or  homogeneous  vinyl  floors.  The  low  initial  cost  may  be  deceiving, however,  for  once  the  top  wear  layer  is  worn  through,  the  floor  will  have  to  be replaced. Some laminated floorings are only guaranteed for three years with moderate use. The cost of laminated vinyl flooring will vary in proportion to the thickness of the top vinyl wear layer. Vinyl Floors In addition to the vinyl resins, vinyl composition tiles  contain  mineral  fillers  such  as  asphalt  and  pigments.  Homogeneous  vinyl  tiles may either be flexible or solid, and it has become the preferred standard for resilient tile  flooring.  It  is  practically  unaffected  by  moisture,  oils,  and  chemical  solvents. Vinyl  is  made  from  asbestos,  fibres,  mineral  pigments  and  PVC.   They  are  very hygienic and deal in hospitals, kitchens, dining area, nurseries, common rooms, lifts etc. They are water and oil resistant and can be made slip resistant.  They are damaged by cleaning gels, high temperature and acids.\n\nThermoplastic: These  are  made  of  asphalt,  fibres,  mineral  fillers  and  pigments  or synthetic  resins  with  vinyl  binder.   The  tiles  are  usually  dark  coloured  and  quite durable.   They  have  good  thermal  insulation  and  are  resistant  to  water.   They  are damaged by heat, acids and alkalis.  They are useful in canteens, corridors, shops and offices. PVC may be added to make hard thermoplastic more flexible.\n\nCork: Cork tile is  made from the outer bark of oak trees. The cork is ground into large granules, mixed with synthetic resins, and pressed into sheets, which are then cut into tiles.  Contemporary cork tiles for floors usually have a top layer of clear vinyl applied to them. This vinyl layer protects the cork from staining and wear.  Cork tiles traditionally  have  had  limited  application  in  industrial  or  institutional  settings.  One reason is that cork is susceptible to staining because it is one of the most porous of all floor coverings. Another limitation is that it is not durable; it is highly susceptible to abrasion. Cinders, sand, and gravel tracked on to a cork floor will severely shorten its life span. Finally, it is expensive.\n\nTable5.2 cleaning methods of different types of flooring\n\n",

Soft floor coverings commonly consist of two types: Carpets and Rugs.\n\nCarpets: Carpets are used extensively in hotels and institutional establishment.  The type of carpet selected will depend upon the suitability and traffic in the area.  They may be used in bedrooms, lounges, TV rooms, restaurants, office and corridors.  A good quality carpet should be able to withstand spillages, cigarette ash and grit.  They must also be resilient to heavy furniture.\n\nRugs and matting: Rugs may be used on floors where wall-to-wall carpeting is not advisable. In heavy traffic areas, rugs can be turned over to neutralize wear and tear. They can be rolled and removed for cleaning and modifications in arrangement.  Rugs may be used to control noise and add colour or pattern to the floor.

The pile is longer and less close than Wilton carpets. They are of three types.\n\nSpool Axminster :  this is the most popular Axminster carpets and a single piece can have an unlimited numbers of colours in the pattern. The carpet is woven in such a manner that the pattern is visible o both the side.\n\nGripper Axminster ;  Same as spool Axminster carpets but the difference being the maximum eight colours only.\n\nChenille Axminster carpets: In French Chenille refers to a -caterpillar‖.

Care  is  necessary  to  prevent  over  wetting  which  may  damage  the adhesive.\n\nNeedle  Loom: These  carpets  have  no  pile  but  are  made  by  needle  punching  and entangling  a  mixture  of  fibres  through  a  backing  fabric  and  coating  it  with  resin. Nylon, jute and polypropylene are used.  Heat may be applied to fix the fibres.\n\nBonded Pile: In this type of carpet, the pile is compacted and bonded to an adhesive backing.   Shortcut  pile,  loops,  cords  or  electrostatic  flocking  may  be  used. Application of heat causes firm bonding.\n\nElectro statically flocked carpets: Bonding is also used for flocked carpets, which have  thousands  of  small  fibres  electro  statically  bonded  to  an  adhesive-coated backing.\n\nKnitted  Carpets: these  carpets  are  produced  by  interlacing  yarns  I  the  series  of connected  loops.  As  in  woven  carpets,  the  pile  and  backing  are  produced simultaneously. Multiple sets of needles interlace the pile, backing and stitching yarns together in one operation.\n\nLaying of carpets: Carpets in hotels and institutions are fitted from wall to wall and along the skirting.  The carpets may be fixed by using glue or narrow strips of wood, which are tacked to the wall or sunken into a recessed area in the floor carpets along staircases must be fixed permanently with metal tacks to prevent accidents.  Special treatments  like  flame  proofing,  moth  proofing,  water  resistance  and  anti  static treatment may be given to carpets to improve their function of durability and ease of maintenance.  Disinfectant solutions may be also added in carpet treatment.\n\nCare and maintenance: Carpets are easily soiled and damaged. They require regular and frequent care.  Daily attention must be provided to remove stains and dirt from carpets.   Dust,  dirt,  grit,  organic  substances  and  cigarette  ash  may  cause  damage. Furniture indentation and cigarette ash, residue shampoo and pests may damage the pile.  Spot cleaning of stains immediately is essential to prevent penetration and built up stains.  Dry suction, vacuum cleaning must be done every day to remove surface dust and grit.  Scraps of paper, pins  and other wastes must be brushed away before vacuuming.  Shampooing of carpets is essential periodically.  The frequency depends upon the type of traffic and nature of carpets.   Most housekeeping departments may call  for  contract  cleaning.   Carpets  must  be  tested  before  shampooing.   Hand shampooing  is  very  tiresome  and  ineffective.   It  is  suitable  for  corners  and  stairs. Liquid or dry foam shampoo may be used.  This traps the dirt and loosens it from the pile.   Special  brushes  help  to  clean  from  the  pile. Special  brushes  help  to  clean  the pile.

Shampoos are anionic synthetic detergents and should be diluted in the correct measures for optimal performance. Liquid shampoos produce very little foam but tend to leave a residue that traps dirt, making it necessary to shampoo the carpet frequently. Dry-foam shampoos are actually also liquids, but they leave dry foam on the surface of the carpet after application- hence the name. The foam loosens and lifts out the dirt, holding it on the surface of the carpet pile until it can be removed by dry section. Dry-foam shampoos contain some solvent in addition to the detergent to assist in  the  removal  of  solvent-soluble  dirt.  Carpets  cleaned  with  a  dry-foam  shampoo require less drying time as well. Carpet shampoo machines are used to dispense both types f shampoos. A cylindrical brush woks the foam into the pile of the carpet.\n\nHot-water extraction this  is  done  by  a  hot-water  extraction  machine. The machine uses  a  shampoo  solution  that  does  not  form  foam  It  injects  the  solution  under  high pressure through the pile to the back of the carpet, where it emulsifies and looses dirt and  grease.  Simultaneously,  the  machine  sucks  up  the  solution  along  with  the  now suspended dirt and grease. The use of a wet-suction machine after shampooing greatly accelerates the drying time. The dirty solution is deposited into a tank, from which it is  discarded  later.  After  the  cleaning  process,  the  carpet  is  left  slightly  damp  and requires a very short drying time.\n\nDry  powdering In  this  method,  a  powder  containing  absorbents  such  as  sawdust, solvent and drying agents is sprinkled on the carpet and left or several minutes. The powder  absorbs  the  grease  and  dirt  and  is  removed  with  the  help  of  a  dry-suction cleaner. Waterborne dirt is removed by use of such a powder, therefore this method is not very efficient.

Textile has an important bearing on our daily lives and everyone needs to know about textiles as we use them in some way or the other. To understand about textiles the study of textiles will help to a great extent when we buy textile materials this knowledge will prevent  us  from  making  mistakes  and  we  will  be  able  to  purchase  good  quality materials. There is a growing demand for textiles and clothing by people of all walks of life.\n\nYarns are produced by twisting or spinning of the textile fibres and in turn fabric is a structure produced by interlacing or interloping of the yarns. There are certain terms which are used very often in the study of textiles that are to be understood first. Most of the fabrics we use for various purposes are woven that means they are constructed by interlacing sets of yarns that run along lengthwise and crosswise directions. Each yarn is made up of several fibres therefore it is essential to know or to define the terms like fibre, yarns and fabrics.\n\nA -fibre -is defined as any product capable of being woven or otherwise made into fabric.  It  is  smallest  visible  unit  of  textile  product.  A  fibre  can  be  defined  as  a -pliable‖ hair like strand that is very small in diameter in relation to its length‖. Fibres are the fundamental units or the building blocks used in the making of textile yarns and  fabrics.

They are made up of protein molecules. Animal fibres have high resiliency but weak when wet because they are bad conductors of heat. E.g. Silk, wool\n\nMineral fibres: They are the inorganic materials shaped in to fibres and are mainly used in the fire proof fabrics. Asbestos is the example of mineral fibre. Mineral fibres are fire proof, resistant to acids and are used for industrial purposes E.g. Asbestos\n\nMan made fibres: These refer to those fibres that are not naturally present in nature and are made artificially by man. Man made fibres have high strength, strong when wet low moisture absorption characteristics.

Examples are rayon (cellulose out of viscose/acetate/triacetate) of different types, casein fibre (from milk) and soya bean fibre.\n\nSynthetic  fibres -  These  are  made  using  various  petrochemical  products.  Nylon, acrylic and polyester are all synthetic fibres. It is advisable to use garments made of natural fibres which are eco-friendly in nature.

In fact synthetics have high luster which is purposefully removed during spinning.\n\nStatic Electricity: It is generated by the friction of a fabric when it is rubbed against itself or other objects. If the electrical charge that is not conducted away, it tends to build  up  on  the  surface  and  when  fabric  comes  in  contact  with  a  good  conductor  a shock or transfer occurs. This transfer may sometimes produce sparks. This is more feel during hot and humid conditions.\n\nCrimp: Wool fibre is more or less wavy and has twists. This waviness is termed as crimp . Finer the wool more will be the crimps in it. Marino wool will have 30 crimps per inch while coarse wool has only one or two. This property of having crimps gives elasticity to the fibre.\n\nElasticity: It  is  the  ability  of  stretched  material  to  return immediately to  its original size.\n\nDifference between cellulose and synthetic fibres: Among natural fibres available cotton, wool and silk are the most commonly used fibres for making fabrics. Among artificial  fibres  rayon,  nylon  and  polyester  are  popular.  The  following  are  5+the differences  between  vegetable  fibres  and  synthetic  fibres.

Among the recent findings at Mohenjo-Daro  were  a  few  scrapes  of  cotton  sticking  to  the  side  of  a  slivers  vase. Cotton is the white downy covering of the seed grown in the pods. The cotton plant grown in the tropics needs a climate with 6 months of summer weather to blossom and produce pods. The cotton fibre is the shortest of all the textile fibres. Its length varies from 8/10 of an inch to 2 inches. Cotton with short length fibres is technically known as -short staple‖. The one with the long fibres is called -long staple‖ and it more used since it is used for making fine qualities of cloth. Long staple is especially suitable as it  is  easy  to  spin  and  produces  a  strong  smooth  yarn.

Sheets and pillow cases are mostly blends of cotton with polyester or made of pure cotton. Drapes, curtains and  upholstery  fabrics  are  made  of  cotton  and  its  blends.  Since  cotton  can  be autoclaved at high temperatures, absorbency, wash ability and low static build up are important factors for use of cotton in hospitals. Industrial uses include book bindings, luggage and hand bags, shoes and, slippers, tobacco cloth, woven wiping cloths as and wall covering fabrics.\n\nWide range of wearing apparels: blouses, shirts, dresses, children wear, active wear, separates  swimwear,  suits,  jackets,  skirts,  pants,  sweaters,  hosiery,  bedspreads, comforters, throws, sheets, towels, table cloths, table mats, napkins.\n\nLinen: Elegant,  beautiful,  durable,  the  refined  luxury  fabric.  Linen  is  the strongest of the vegetable fibers and has 2 to 3 times the strength of cotton. Linen  table  cloths  and  napkins  have  been  handed  down  generation  to generation. Not only is the linen fiber strong, it is smooth, making the finished fabric lint free.\n\nLinen is from flax, a bust fiber taken from the stalk of the plant. The luster is from  the  natural  wax  content.  Creamy  white  to  light  tan,  this  fiber  can  be easily  dyed  and  the  color  does  not  fade  when  washed.  Linen  does  wrinkle easily  but  also  presses  easily.  Linen,  like  cotton,  can  also  be  boiled  without damaging the fiber.\n\nHighly absorbent and a good conductor of heat, this fabric is cool in garments. However, constant creasing in the same place in sharp folds will tend to break the linen threads. This wear can show up in collars, hems, and any area that is iron  creased  during  the  laundering.  Linen  has  poor  elasticity  and  does  not spring back readily.\n\nManufacturing  of  linen: Linen  is  yarn,  and  fabric  made  from  flax  fibres.  Before linen  can  be  produced,  the  fibre  has  to  be  first  removed  from  the  flax  plant.  Linen manufacturing is a complicated and lengthy process which requires great skill at each stage of production:\n\nCultivating Flax: Linen is a natural yarn or fabric which comes from the fibres of the stalk of the flax plant. To get the most from the fibre, the textile flax is not cut, but pulled from the ground to preserve the long, full length of the fibres which run the entire length of the plant (80/120cm). After this the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and is then retted.\n\nRippling: This is where the seeds are taken off the plant. Rippling involved combing the seeds off with a coarse comb.\n\nRetting: The flax fibres are held together in the stems by woody material and cellular tissue, and retting is where the deseeded crop of flax straw is subjected to a controlled chemical or biological treatment to make the fibre bundles are easier to separate from the woody part of the stem. Flax can be:\n\nWater-retted : Water-retting is where the flax plants after pulling are tied up in sheaves and put in special dams or ponds for one to two weeks. This method can cause pollution. Today this method is seldom used in Europe, and water retting is more normally carried out in controlled conditions in tanks.\n\nDew-retted :  dew-retting the flax straw is spread on the ground after pulling and left in the fields for 2 to 8 weeks, depending on the weather. This is the most common method in Western Europe, and is less expensive than waterretting in tanks.\n\nWooden vat retting : the stems are steeped in water at a temperature of 70 to 90 in a vat until the stem got soft. The stem than removed from the water, and to loosen the stalk the fibre are passed through rollers by a method known as Pownall process.\n\nBreaking  and  Scutching :  This  is  a  mechanical  operation  which,  by  breaking  and beating  the  flax  straw,  separates  the  textile  fibres  in  the  stem  of  the  plant  from  the woody matter which is then used for the manufacture of chipboard. No part of the flax plant is wasted. Fibres are then hackled (combed) to separate long line and short tow fibres.\n\nHackling: Line fibres then go through a process where they are drafted and doubled, until a rove (a slightly twisted sliver of flax fibre) has been formed. They then undergo the wet spinning process. Line fibres produce fine, strong yarn. Short tow fibres are dry spun and a heavy, coarse yarn results, ideal for use as furnishing fabrics, heavier apparel and knitwear\n\nSpinning: This rove is then spun into a yarn but during this process it is soaked in warm water, which softens the natural gummy substances contained in the yarn and permits the individual fibrils within each fibre to slide in relation to each other, thus producing a very fine and regular yarn. This is called \"wet spinning\".\n\n",

For separating the silk thread from the cocoons they are immersed in hot water. This immersion also kills the warm inside. Then the cocoons are dries and stored.\n\nReeling: The process of unwinding the filament from the cocoon is called reeling. The care and skill in the reeling operation prevents defects in the raw silk. As the filament of single cocoon is too fine for commercial use, three to ten strands are usually reeled at a time to produce the desired diameter of raw silk thread.\n\nThrowing: As the fibres are combined and pulled on to the reel, twist can be inserted to  hold  the  filaments  together.  This  is  called  as  throwing  and  the  resulting  yarn  is ‗thrown yarn'. This yarn later goes to weaving or knitting industry based the type of yarn produced.\n\nSpinning: Short ends of silk fibres from the outer and inner edges of the cocoons and from broken cocoons and spun into yarns in a manner similar to that used for cotton. This is called spun silk.\n\nDegumming: Sericin or gum up to 30% of the weight of the silk fibre. It is not usually removed until after the cloth is woven because serves as warp sizing that protects the yarns  from  mechanical  injury  during  weaving.  Sericin  remains  on  the  fibre  during reeling  and  throwing  before  finishing,  the  gum  is  removed  by  boiling  the  fabric  in soap and water. The presence of gum and sericin increases the tendency for the silk to water spots on fabrics when ironed.\n\nBleaching: Silk thread is treated with hydrogen peroxide.\n\nFinishing: Silk  fabrics  require  very  few  finishes  because  they  have  natural  luster, softness and drapability.\n\nWeighting of silk: When silk is boiled to remove the excess of natural gum or sericin it looses weight. This loss of weight is replaced through treatment by metals like tin, aluminum etc in water solutions. These are not removed by washing. Weighted silk is not durable because sunlight and perspiration weakens fibres. Heavy weighting causes silk to crack.\n\n",

More over smoothness of the silk filament yarn reduces the problem of wear from abrasion. The strength of the spun silk yarns depends on the length of silk staple.\n\nShape  and  appearance: Silk  filaments  are  very  fine  and  long.  They  frequently measure about 1000 to 1300 yards in length. The width of the silk is from 9 to 11 microns.\n\nElasticity: It is an elastic fibre and its elasticity varies as it is natural fibre. Silk fibre may  be  stretched  from  1/7  to  1/5  its  original  length  before  breaking.  Cultivated degummed  silk  viewed  longitudinally  under  a  microscopic,  resembles  a  smooth transparent rod under microscope. Silk in the gum has rough irregular surface.\n\nResilience: Silk  retains  the  shape  and  resists  wrinkling  rather  well.  This  is  more  in fabrics made from pure silk rather than spun silk or weighted silk.\n\nDrapability: Silk  has  a  pliability  and  suppleness'  that  aided  by  its  elasticity  and resilience gives it excellent drapability.\n\nHeat  conductivity: Since  silk  is  a  protein  fibre.  It  is  a  non  conductor  of  heat  like wool. Hence it is used for winter apparel.\n\nAbsorbency: The  good  absorptive  property  of  silk  also  contributes  to  its  effect  in warmer atmosphere. Silk generally absorbs about 11% of its weight in moisture which makes silk for easy dying and printing.\n\nShrinkage: Due to the filament in length, smooth surface silk have normal shrinkage which can be easily restored by ironing at moderate heat and damp conditions.\n\nResistance  to  mildew: Silk  will  not  be  affected  by  mildew  unless  left  for  time  in damp state or under extreme conditions of tropical dampness.\n\nReaction to alkalis: Silk is not as sensitive as wool to alkalis. It may be affected in concentrations  and  high  temperatures.  Cold  concentrated  solutions  of  alkali  such  as soda or caustic potash has slight action on silk. Heated solution dissolved silk.\n\nReaction  to  acids: acids do not harm them while medium concentrated HCL will dissolve silk.\n\nAffinity  for  dyes: unsatisfactory.\n\nConcentrated  mineral  acids  dissolve  faster  than  wool.

Silk  is  used primarily in apparel and home furnishing items  because of its  appearance and  cost. Silk is extremely versatile and can be used to create a variety of fabrics from sheer chiffons  to  heavy  beautiful  brocades  and  velvets.  Because  of  silk  absorbency  it  is appropriate for warm weather wear. Because of its low conductivity it is used for cold weather  wear,  also  in  furnishing  silk  is  often  blended  with  other  fibres  to  add  soft luster for furnishing fabric. Occasionally expensive hands made rugs are made from silk.\n\nWOOL: Wool has the one of the first fibres to be converted into fabric. Wool fibre grows from skin of sheep. It is composed of protein known as keratin. It is crimp and has scales on its surface depending upon the breed of sheep. The natural protein fibre consists of amino acids. Wool has 19 amino acids, keratin, protein and other organic acids.  Man  uses  wool  as  clothing  in  the  very  early  stages  of  human  history.  The primitive man is used it in the form of skin of certain animals to protect as well as to decorate his body. Man then discovered the use of hair of sheep after interlocking and twisting  them  together  under  pressure  and  thus  hair  of  sheep  were  used  in  making fabrics  the  interlocking  of  woolen  fabrics  is  known  as  felting.  Wool  was  probably known to the primitive man as he used sheep skin to cover his body even before the discovery of other fibres. Wool is yellowish white fibre and has medium luster. It is considered to be weak fibre than many other fibres however other properties such as resiliency and elasticity compensate for low strength.\n\nStructure of wool: When the wool is fibre is untwisted it shows a kinky appearance. The length varies from 1,1/2 to 18 inches, the long fibres are coarser than short fibres. When observed under microscope the surface of the fibre seems to be consisted to scales irregular of shape and slightly overlapping like scales of fish.\n\n",

The most important use of wool is for apparel coats, jackets, suits, dresses, skirts,  slacks  made  from  woven  fabrics  of  varying  weights  and  knitted  fabrics'.  All these gives the warmth garments and with good tailored look. In the home furnishing area the major use of wool is in carpets and rugs where wool is used more, cover to the carpets and warm in the rugs. Blends of different synthetic fibres with wool for suiting  materials  are  increasingly  important.  This  result  in  fabrics  that  are  more appropriate  in  warmer  conditions.  Polyester  is  the  most  important  fibre  used  in blending with wool.\n\nMAN-MADE FIBERS: A  rayon  fiber  was  the  first  man-made  composed  of  pure cellulose  the  substance  of  which  is  the  man  constituent  of  cell  walls  of  trees  and cotton. Rayon fibers are made from cellulose that has been reformed or regenerated. Consequently, these fibers are identified as -regenerated cellulose fibers‖. Because of its luster and soft hand feel, it resembled silk and came to be known as -artificial silk‖. However it is more like cotton in its chemical composition\n\nRayon: Robert Hooke, the English naturalist, had prophesied the production of a fiber such as rayon, the first of the manmade fibers long ago in 1664. He believed that it was possible to  make  an  -artificial  glutinous  composition‖  much  resembling,  if  not fully like silk worm secretion George Audemars, a Swiss chemist, discovered how to make cellulose  nitrate.  In  1884,  count  Hilaire  de  hardonnet  produced  the  first  man made  textile  fibers  from  nitro  cellulose.  He  is  known  as  -father  of  Rayon‖.  Wood Rayon is produced in many ways. Viscose Rayon is popular among customers. It is made from pulp and cotton linters. The other is cellulose rayon (acetate rayon) in the chemist  terminology;  rayon  and  acetate  are  not  synthetic  because  natural  materialscotton,  linters  and  wood  pulp  are  used  in  their  manufacture,  rather  than  chemical elements.\n\nSource  of  Rayon: Rayon  is  an  artificial,  man-made  or  synthetic  fibre  made  from cellulose. Commercially rayon was produced about 48 years back. Rayon produced at that  time  was  very  lustrous  they  were  given  this  name  which  means  -reflecting  the rays  of  sun‖.  The  main  objective  in  manufacturing  rayon  was  to  provide  a  cheap substitute for silk. India has been importing rayon fabrics and rayon yarn.\n\nManufacture of Rayons: All types of rayon are made from cellulose. There are main four main procedures by which cellulose is transformed into rayon. They are\n\nThe general principles of rayon yarn production involve the following steps.\n\nThe  nitrocellulose  process: In  this,  cotton  is  reduced  to  nitrocellulose  by  treating cotton  with  sulphuric  and  nitric  acid.  This  gives  an  inflammable  material.  This material  is  dissolved  in  ether  and  the  fluid  is  force  through  tiny  holes  into  air.  The ether  evaporates  and  a  fine  thread  is  obtained,  which  is  treated  with  sodium hydrosulphide to render it non-flammable.\n\nThe cuprammonium process: This process has been used since 1897 . In this process, cotton  linters  are  used.  These  are  firs  boiled  in  soda  and  soda-ash  and  then  are bleached  with  chlorine.  These  are  dissolved  in  a  solution  of  copper  sulphate  and ammonium hydroxide. This liquid is left for ageing or ripening. This is then passed through  fine  jets  into  a  solution  of  dilute  acid  when  it  is  turned  into  regenerated cellulose filament. This filament is stretched to form a fine thread.\n\nThe  viscose  process: This  process  was  discovered  in  1892,  but  the  yarn  was commercially produced a few years later. In this process spruce chips are used. These are first bleached and then steeped in caustic soda to form alkali cellulose. It is treated with carbon bi-sulphide to form cellulose xanthate and is dissolved in dilute caustic soda solution. This is kept for ageing until a thick fluid is formed, which is known as viscose  This  fluid  is  forced  through  fine  jets  into  a  coagulating  solution  of  dilute sulphuric acid which regenerates the cellulose into a continuous fibre. This process is largely  used  in  the  manufacture  of  rayons.  If  a  dull  appearance  is  desired,  small\n\nproportion  of  a  white  opaque  pigment  (usually  titanium  dioxide)  is  added  to  the viscose solution.\n\nThe cellulose acetate process: This process has been commercially developed since 1918 although the process was discovered half a century earlier in 1869.\n\nIn  this  process  cotton  inters  are  treated  with  solution  of  acetic  anhydride  and  acetic acid. This acetic acid combines with cellulose o form celluloseacetate. This is kept for ageing until it is ripened.

Yet it produces fairly durable, economical and serviceable fabric whose smoothness of surface favorably withstands with friction of wear\n\nElasticity: Viscose rayon has greater elasticity than cotton but less than wool and silk. While  viscose  rayon  fabrics  have  some  inherent  extensibility,  undue  strain  might cause them to sag or even burst.\n\nHeat  Conductivity: Viscose  rayon  is  a  good  conductor  of  heat  and  is  therefore appropriate for summer clothing like cotton.\n\nAbsorbency: Viscose  rayon  is  one  of  the  most  absorbent  of  all  textiles.  It  is  more absorbent than cotton or linen, but less than wool and silk.\n\nReaction to Bleaches: Household bleaches containing sodium hypo chlorite, sodium perborate or hydrogen peroxide may be safely used.\n\nShrinkage: Viscose  rayon  fabrics  tend  to  shrink  more  than  cotton  fabrics.  Spun Viscose rayon fabrics shrink more, which can be given a shrink resistant finish, such as Sanforset.\n\nEffect  of  Heat :  Viscose  rayon  is  pure  cellulose  fiber  which  burns  as  cotton.  When ironing, only moderately hot temperature must be used.\n\nReaction to Alkaline: Concentrated solutions of alkalies disintegrate Viscose rayon. A mild soap with lukewarm water is recommended in washing rayons.\n\nReaction to Acids: Being pure cellulose, the fabric is disintegrated by hot dilute and cold concentrated acids similar to that of cotton.\n\nAffinity of Dyes: Viscose  rayon  fabrics  absorb  dye  evenly  and  can  be  dyed  with  a variety of dyes, like acid, chrome, and disperse.\n\n",

The  first polyester  fiber  is  known  as  ‗Dacron'  in  America  and  ‗Terylene'  in  Britain.  Later various  types  of  polyesters  are  produced.  Terylene  fiber  is  made  by  synthesizing terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. The ground work for development of polyester fiber is done by W.H. Carothers. Polyester fiber is the long chain polymer produced from  elements  derived  from  coal,  air,  water  and  petroleum.  Polyester  is  a thermoplastic  fiber  and  has  good  strength.  It  melts  in  flame  and  forms  a  grey  hard non-crushable bead. It is an easy care fabric and can be easily washed. Polyester fiber looks like a smooth, glass rod similar to Nylon. If delustered it shows black spotted appearance. The length, width, shape and luster of the polyester fibers are controlled during manufacture to suit a specific end use. It is mostly blended with other fibers to improve its absorbency and to lower static electricity.\n\nMethod  of  Manufacture: Generally  each  company  produces  its  own  variety  of polyester through there are likely modifications under specific trademarks. E.g.: PET (Principle  raw  material  is  ethylene  diamine  and  terepthalic  acid)  obtained  from petroleum and PCDT polyester.\n\nSpinning of Fiber: The molten polymer is rigorously maintained at airtight condition, as oxygen will affect its stability. The viscous melt is extruded through spinneret, and the  filaments  are  subsequently  drawn  into  desired  polyester  fiber.  Variations  in production process depend on desired end results.\n\n",

      "content": "Beetling: This process produces luster and softness and gives te fabric a firm, leathery feel.  Earlier  it  was  done  by  beating  the  surface  with  wooden  mallets,  but  now  a machine with a number of steel hammer is used. The fibres are flattened, the weaves are closed and thus the desired lustrous effect is produced.\n\nCalendaring: Calendaring  is  essentially  an  ironic  process.  Most  fabrics  (and  yarns too)  become  stiff  board  like  when  wet  and  dried  under  tension.  Running  the  fabric through  a  calendar  removes  the  stiffness  and  makes  it  quite  soft.  At  the  same  time calendaring  flattens  the  yarns  and  makes  it  so  lustrous.  The  process  consists  of applying a lot of pressure by passing the cloth between cylinders of heavy weight of compressed cotton and steel. Rayon fabrics are not calendared as as cotton or linen, but  silk  often  requires  fairly  heavy  calendaring  some  calendars  use  waxy  calendars substances  to  give  added  luster  in  addition  to  friction  treatment  by  steam  heated pressure cylinders. Calendaring flattens and close the threads of the fabric to give it the  required  smooth  feel  and  appearance.  The  finish  depends  chiefly  on  pressure, temperature and moistures.\n\nShearing/ brushing: This process removes the short fibers from the cloth coming off a  loom. The cloth is first passed over one or two stream heated copper cylinders to remove moisture and to raise a nap. The projecting fibres are then singed (burnt) by passing the cloth over a hot plate or through a gas flame at high speed, leaving the cloth with a smooth surface. It is immediately put into water to remove any sparks.\n\nTentering: To bring a fabric to the right width it is passed through a 20-90 feet long tentering machine. The cloth is carried through the machine by two moving chains of clips  or  pins  one  on  each  side  which  grip  the  selvedge  firmly.  Tentering  is  an important and necessary operation because the fabric has been pulled in length during bleaching,  dyeing  and  drying  and  is  therefore  generally  narrower  than  the  required finished length. In order that the stretching may takes place easily, the cloth is slightly dampened or steamed. After stretching it is passed through a hot air chamber to dry and set at this width.\n\nMoireing : One of the most interesting surfaces is the ‗moire' finish. A cloth with a filling wiser rib weave is run between rollers engraved with many lines and thus given a watered effect. On acetate clothes. The finish will remain in good condition after the fabrics are laundered. Rayons are given resin treatment to set the design.\n\nEmbossing: The fabric  is  passed  between  heated  rollers  that  imprint  or emboss  the design on the fabric. This design is less expensive than a woven design.\n\nGlazing: After  the  fabrics  are  bleached,  dyed  or  printed  they  may  be  given  a  stiff polished or glazed surface. Starch glue or resin may be used to stiffen the fabric. Then smooth hot rollers that generate friction are applied since the advent of resins in the finishing field permanent finish gaze can be applied to chintz and other muslins.\n\nSanforizing: Many fabric shrink after their first wash. The process ensures less than 1% shrinkage for fabric after washing. The process is carried out by passing the pre shrunk fabric between a thick cloth and surface of a steam heated roller.\n\nNapping: The warmth and softness of wool flannel or a brushed wool sweater is due in part to the fuzzy soft surface called nap. It is the process of raising short fibers of cloth to the surface by means of revolving cylinders with metallic points. Cotton and synthetic fabrics of spun yarns may be napped to resemble wool in texture. Generally yarns used in the fabric should have low twist.\n\nFilling Finishes : The aim of the use filling or sizing agents on fabrics are:\n\nSizing, stiffing and starching: To increase the weight, body crispiness, stiffness and luster cotton and polyester blends are stiffed. Generally starch, glue, wax, casein, clay etc are used. It is not a permanent finish.\n\nWeighting of silk and wool: weighting is the term used for filling in silk and wool. The filling agents are metallic salts.\n\nSilk: it is weighted either at the yarn stage or as woven material. It is also weighted during the process of dyeing by adding weighting substances to the dye. The usual weighting substances used are tin chloride and tannate Fibres absorb salt  and swell. These are  not removed by washing. Heavily weighted silk has a poor wearing quality. Wool:  wool  is  weighted  with  magnesium  chloride  so  that  the  cloth  absorb  more moisture and its weight is thus increased\n\n",

It also gives the cloth a greater affinity for coloring  matters  for  especially  deeper,  brighter  shades  with  dye  stuff.  The  cloth  is impregnated with an 18-20% solution of caustic soda for one half of two minutes at room temperatures. The cloth is stretched while saturated and then washed out while it is still in tension. The treatment produces a permanent change in the structure of the cotton fiber.\n\nParchment zing: These are the permanent finishes on cotton and still remain of great importance. They were discovered by John Mercer in 1844. The higher concentration of  the  sulphuric  acid  produces  the  parchmentsing  effects.  Parchmentsing  acid probably  gelatinizes  the  surface  of  the  cotton  and  causes  the  fibers  of  cohere  some extent.\n\nCreping: It is a chemical process by the treatment caustic soda on fabrics. The soda paste is applied to fabrics in a definite design of strips or figure. The parts to which the paste is applied shrinks leaving the other parts unshrunk. Thus the creped material will produced.\n\nBurnt out finish: Burnt out finish gives transparent effect possible on blended fabrics only looks different from others. Forms opaque woven designs against a transparent back ground.\n\nStarch less finish : To reduce the use of starch for a crisp finish that can be durable for repeated washings. Cottons are treated with resins. This starchless finish is permanent and does not dissolves in laundering.\n\nWash  and  wear: Permanent  starch  less  finish  can  be  used  on  curtains,  draperies, sheer cottons for apparel. It is used on organdy, lawn, voile and other sheet cottons.\n\nBleaching: Bleaches are used to render colored or discolored fabrics white. Bleaches are  used  in  laundering  to  remove  stains  that  do  not  respond  to  normal  washing. Bleaches should not be used as cleansers. It is not possible to bleach dirty laundry. Bleaching agents can be divided into two classes:\n\nOxidizing  bleach supply  oxygen  that  combines  with  stains  to  form  a  colorless compound. Normal as well as stained fabrics can be oxidized so the bleach must be in contact with the fabric only till the stain is removed. Longer contact will weaken the fabric.\n\nReducing bleaches work by removing oxygen from the colorings matter of the stain.\n\n",

      "content": "A yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres. Strands of fibres are brought closer  to  each  other  by  twisting.  Twists  impart  strength  to  the  fibre  strand  which  is then termed as a yarn. It is suitable for the production of fabrics, thread for sewing, crocheting, knitting, embroidery and/or rope making. A thread is a highly twisted and smooth strand of fibre. It is used for sewing, embroidery, etc.\n\nSpinning of yarns: Do you know how a yarn is made? Yes, you guessed it right, a yarn is spun. Spinning is the process by which a group of fibres is pulled, drawn and twisted together to make a yarn. Do you remember Mahatma Gandhi and his charkha\n\nor the spinning wheel? Mahatma Gandhi, would daily take a hand full of cotton and spin  it  into  a  yarn  on  his charkha .  He  promoted charkha during  India's  freedom struggle as a symbol of self-reliance and a source of income.\n\nA traditional spinning wheel (charkha) : A charkha is for hand spinning. The yarn spun on a charkha can have different thickness. Thick yarn is used for floor coverings, medium thickness for upholstery items and fine quality yarn is used for making dress material. Different types of fibres - cotton, wool, hemp and silk are spun on charkha in the villages in many states of India.\n\nTwists  given  to  fibre  strands  for  formation  of  a  yarn  can  be  either 'S-twist' (clockwise) or 'Z-twist' (anticlockwise). The quality and strength of yarn is affected by the number of twists in inch. Lesser the number of twists per inch, bulkier and less strong is the yarn and more the number of twists, finer and stronger is the yarn. Figure 10.5 shows S and Z twists and Figure 10.6 shows number of turns in a yarn.\n\nSpinning by Machine: Both, the fibres as well as filaments are spun into yarns that are then used for different end uses. Fibres available in the filament form are first cut into short lengths and then made into yarns called spun yarns. Various steps followed for making yarns are:\n\nClassification of Yarns: Yarns simple novelty knotted yarn, loop yarn single strand ply/multi-strand slub yarn, feather yarn.\n\nThe yarns may be classified into two groups:\n\nSimple Yarn: In the construction of simple yarn, only one kind of fibre is used. The manner in which the fibres are twisted will be the same throughout the yarn. Yarns are known as simple, ply or cable, depending upon the number of strands they contain\n\nSingle Strand Yarn: In this, a number of fibres are twisted together into a continuous length. The yarn consists of one kind of fibre and of one colour. This type f yarn is the one usually found in most standards fabrics for clothing and household use.\n\nPly Yarn: Two or more than to yarns are twisted together to form ply yarn. These are known as multiple strand yarn. If two single strands are twisted together, the resulting yarn is known as two-ply yarn, if three are twisted together, three-ply yarn and so on.\n\nNovelty Yarns: The contrition of these yarns is of a complex nature and is varied in any ways. These yarns are usually ply yarns of different kinds of fibres or of different colours and are irregular rather than smooth. Single strand yarn of different colours, sizes or fibres may be twisted together to form one complex yarn. Another variety is brought about I this kind of yarn by varying tension or sped after intervals of certain length- thus, allowing one part to loop or twist around another. Novelty yarns are also constructed from simple yarn by varying the amount of twist. The complex type of novelty yarn is used with two objects in view, one is to combine different fibres e.g. cotton and rayon may be blended with or covered by wool and silk. This lowers the cost of production. The other purpose to produce novelty yarns for the construction of novelty  yarn,  at  least  one  or  single  yarns  are  used,  one  forms  the  foundation  yarn known as a base or the core and the other, the effect yarn, which is wound or looped around the first one. A third yarn called binder yarn is often used to fasten or tie the effect yarn to the foundation yarn. These types of yarns are mostly used for drapery and upholstery fabrics.\n\n",

      "content": "Weaving and knitting, the two most popular methods of fabric construction have been discussed in detail here.\n\nWeaving: Cotton multiple strand yarn fibres do not break easily thickness synthetic. Weaving is  interlacing  of  two  sets  of  yarns  -warp  and  weft  at  90o  angles  to  each other. Straight yarns in fabric are known as warp yarns. Horizontal yarns are known as weft yarns.  Along  the  length  of  the  woven  fabric,  on  both  sides,  end  yarns  are woven very densely and the portion is named as selvedge . It does not allow the fabric yarns to come out from the lengthwise edge. The portion between the two selvedges is the body of the fabric.\n\nBasic Weaves: Weaves are broadly classified as basic and novelty weaves. Most of fabrics are produced in basic weaves , which are of three typesplain, twill and satin weave.\n\nproduction of fabric is  done in  plain  weave.  It  is  inexpensive  weave, most suitable for printing and embroideries. To see the variations of the weave,  note  the  fabrics  like  muslin,  cambric,  hand  spun  and  hand woven khaddar, organdy, poplin, voile, etc.\n\nFig5.3 Different types of weaves\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKnitting: Knitting is the process of formation of loops of yarns and drawing of new loops  through  those  formed  previously  (interloping).  Depending  on  the  types  of knitting, it  either  moves right to left  or left  to  right  (weft  knitting)  or  the  yarns  run lengthwise  (warp  knitting).

Soft furnishings  include  fibres  that  are  used  for  curtains,  loose  covers,  cushions, bedspreads and quilts. Some articles  in  addition  provide  warmth  and  comfort.  Each article is subjected to variable amount of wear and tear.\n\nTypes of soft furnishing\n\nFig 5.4 Types of soft furnishing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuvets/ Quilts: Provides a warm light bed covering but are quite expensive initially. They may be used as such or given a fabric covering.  Satin, polyester, silk and good quality fabrics are suitable for the top layer of the quilts.  Less slippery material like satin or linen may be used for under layer to prevent slipping.\n\nDuvets have become increasingly popular in hotels and are fast replacing the blanket, especially on double beds. They consist of a filling sandwiched or stitched in a fabric case with a changeable cover. The fillers may be duck/goose down, a feather mix or a combination of the two. The down feathers  are  the  small,  fluffy  feathers.  Although they  are  warmer,  professional  cleaning  is  necessary  and  they  are  heavier  and  more expensive than their synthetic counterparts. The synthetic filling is usually polyester fibres.  These  duvets  are  lighter  and  can  be  washed  in  large-capacity  washing machines. Even if the establishment uses natural fillings to provide the best degree of comfort, a small stock of duvets filled with man-made fibres should be made available for anyone who has an allergy to the natural product. It is essential for the duvet to have  an  outside  cover.  Changing  a  duvet  cover  is  a  skill  which  is  developed  with practice. To save laundry costs and la bour, it is advisable to provide a covering sheer in  conjunction  with  the  duvet  cover.  Though  it  is  common  to  have  all  of  them  in white,  the  duvet  cover,  the  bottom  sheet  and  valance  could  be  part  of  the  colour scheme of the guest room.\n\n",

Selection of fibre should be done with regard to its resistance to fading, abrasion, drape, dimensional stability and flame resistance. The exposure to sunlight and airborne soiling should be considered. Lining of curtains helps to reduce damage of fading and rotting.  Curtains are subjected to abrasion by being pulled and drawn, brush against, rub along a floor or window frames and being laundered.  The abrasion resistance depends upon the type of fibre selected and fabric construction. Loosely woven material tends to loose drape and constant hand drawing may cause loss of shape.
