Hospitality refers to the relationship between guest and host; it also refers to being hospitable.\n\nSome define hospitality as -the business of helping people to feel welcome and relaxed and to enjoy themselves‖ (Discover Hospitality, 2015, ) Hospitality is treating people like you  would  want  to  treated  when  you  are  travelling  in  other  words  it  means  making  a tourist  feels  totally  welcome  not  only  as  your  guest  but  also  as  the  guest  of  the  entire family i.e. family of hotel.\n\nHospitality  can  be  defined  as  deliberate,  planned  and  sustained  effort  to  establish  and maintain  mutual  understanding  between  an  organization  and  public  i.e.  the  business  of\n\nmaking  and  keeping  friends  and  promoting  an  atmosphere  of  better  understanding  the word hospitality is derived from Latin word -Hospitalitias‖.

The basic concept of hospitality is to make the guest feels that they are always welcome‖'.\n\nAlthough the basic concept of hospitality has remained the same but with the passage of time and development of technology and science, the need and wants of travelers have changed  greatly  thus  providing  numerous  services  and  facilities  in  terms  of accommodation and other basic needs such as food and beverages. Simply putting, the hospitality industry is the combination  of  the  accommodation  and  food  and beverage groupings, collectively making up the largest segment of the industry.\n\nThe  hospitality  industry  is  a  part  of  a  larger  enterprise  known  as  travel  and  tourism industry.  The  travel  and  tourism  industry  is  a  vast  group  of  business  with  one  goal  in common : providing necessary or desired services to travelers.

Warriors or traders were the early travelers but they did not have hotels to accommodate them.  The  warriors  used  tents  but  the  merchants  seeking  to  trade  tools,  clothing  and livestock,  traded  merchandise  for  lodging.  The  inns  offered  little  more  than  a  cot  or  a bench in the corner of a room or a stable which were unhygienic too. Most of them were private  residences  of  the  local  residents  that  offered  temporary  residence  or  lodging  to strangers runed by husband and wife team who provided large halls to travelers where they were supposed to make their own bed and sleep on the floor guests used to stayed in large  communal  rooms  where  sanitation  and  privacy  were  non-existent.  After  the establishment of money in 6th century BC, in keeping was one of the first commercial enterprises and hospitality was one of the first services for which money was exchanged.\n\nFig1.1 A caravan of camels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout the world they were known by different names such as: Dharamshalas  and Sarai in India, ryokans in Japan,  paradors in Spain, pousadas in Portugal, coffee house in America, taverens and inns in Europe, cabarets and hostelries in France, mansionis  and hospital in Switzerland, phatnal in Greece and relay house in China.\n\nIn  the  third  century  AD,  Roman Empire developed an extensive system of brick paved roads throughout Europe and Asia minor. Small road side lodges were constructed due to increase in the road transport. During the Industrial Revolution in 1700s, the Europeans began  to  combine  food  and  beverage  service  with  lodging.  No  attention  was  given  to sanitation and beds as well as rooms had to be shared with other travelers. These early European  inns  were  unsuitable  for  aristocrats.  To  accommodate  wealthy  travelers, luxurious structures were erected. These offered private rooms, individual sanitation and all  comforts  of  a  European  castle.  These  elegant  new  establishments  later  adopted  the French name for mansion, ‗hotel'. The rates they charged were very high and well beyond the means of common citizens.\n\n",

      "content": "To understand the origin and development of Hotel industry we need to understand its two pillars - Hospitality industry and Tourism Industry.\n\nWhat Is Tourism? Before going through the details of the growth of the hotel industry let's look back and try to understand its origin i.e. from why people travel or undertake tourism, let's understand what this term means- The word tour is derived from the Latin word  tornus  meaning  a  tool  for  making  a  circle.  Tourism  in  simple  is  defined  as  the movement  of  people  from  their  normal  place  of  residence  to  another  place  with  the intention  to  return  for  a  minimum  period  of  twenty  four  hours  to  a  maximum  of  six months for the sole purpose of leisure and pleasure.\n\nIt  can  also  be  defined  as  -It  is  the  movement  of  people  from  their  normal  place  of residence & work for a period of not less than 24 hours and not more than 1 year‖.\n\nW.T.O.\n\nAccording to Henniker & Kroff tourism is -The sum of phenomenon and relationship arising from the travel as it does not lead to permanent residence and is not connected to any earning activity.‖\n\nThe League of Nations in 1937 defined tourism as -Tourism covers the social activity of those  who  travel  for  a  period  of  24  hours  or  more  in  a  country  other  than  the  one  the person usually lives in.‖\n\nAccording to Tourism Society of Britain -Tourism is a temporary, short term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during their stay at these destinations, including day visit & excursion.\n\nThus there are a number of ways tourism can be defined, and for this reason, the United Nations  World  Tourism  Organization (UNWTO) embarked  on  a  project  from  2005  to 2007  to  create  a  common  glossary  of  terms  for  tourism.  It defines  tourism  as  follows: -Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people  to  countries  or  places  outside  their  usual  environment  for  personal  or business/professional  purposes.  These  people  are  called  visitors  (which  may  be  either tourists  or  excursionists;  residents  or  non-residents)  and  tourism  has  to  do  with  their activities,  some  of  which  imply  tourism  expenditure  (United  Nations  World  Tourism Organization, 2008).‖\n\nTourist - it's meaning: Using this definition, we can see that tourism is the movement of people  for  a  number  of  purposes  (whether  business  or  pleasure).  Building  on  the definition  of  tourism,  a  commonly  accepted  description  of  a tourist is  -someone  who travels at least 80 km from his or her home for at least 24 hours, for business or leisure or other reasons‖ (LinkBC, 2008, p.8). It can also be defined by UNWTO as -People who travel  to  and  stay  in  place  outside  their  usual  environment  for  not  more  than  one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity  remunerated from within the place visited. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (1995) helps us break down this definition further by stating tourists can be:\n\nInternational Tourism - When people visit a foreign country, it is referred to as international tourism. In order to travel to a foreign country one requires passport, visa, health documents, foreign exchange etc. International tourist may be inbound or outbound:\n\nInbound -non-residents travelling in a given country, i.e. refers to tourist of outside origin entering a particular country\n\nOutbound -  residents  of  one  country travelling  in  another  country  i.e. refers  to  tourist  travelling  from  the  country  of  their  origin  to  another country.\n\nDomestic  Tourism: The  residents  of  a given  country  travelling  only  within that country.  Travelling  within  the  same  country  is  easier  because  it  does  not require  formal  travel  documents  and  other  formalities  like  compulsory  health check and foreign exchange etc.\n\n",
      "summary": "Here is a summary in under 70 words:\nTourism is the movement of people from their normal residence to another place for leisure or business, staying at least 24 hours and up to 6 months. It can be international or domestic, with various definitions and types, including inbound, outbound, and domestic tourism.",

Today  With  disposable  income,  faster transport  and  greater  time  for  leisure,  people  have  ventured  into  new  horizons  which seemed only dreams till yesterday. Some of the reasons for travelling are as follows:\n\nSightseeing: This  is  a  strong  reason  to  travel.  Sightseeing  is  visiting  places  of  interest. International  culture  attracts  men  and  their  exploration  always  fascinates  him.  Culture includes the away people live the their history cuisines, arts, handicrafts languages etc . tour operators therefore organize tour packages to meet the need of the clientage.\n\nLeisure: This  comes  as  a  strong  motivation  in  highly  stressed  work  life.  Leisure  is  a passive recreation where people just want to put up their feet's and relax. There are many sources  of  leisure  like  weather  is  the  major  attraction  as  some  like  cold  weather  while others  get  fascinated  by  deserts  and  sea  beaches.  Spas  are  creations  of  new  age  health conscious people.\n\nReligious travel: This has always fascinated humankind from ancient times. We know of pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the Christians and the Haj to Mecca for the Hindus, etc. This involves large-scale travelling with millions of travelers at a time.\n\nReligious travelers observe ambience and have very little needs. Some may have dietary restriction like vegetarian food or foods without some ingredients. They may want prayer rooms and perhaps a priest of their faith on premises\n\nBusiness: The movement of people for business reasons has been a great motivator for people to travel from the beginning merchants travelled with their merchandise from one city to another city for trading. We have evidence of trade between Egypt, Phoenicia, and Indus Valley Mesopotamia. Naturally business has become more sophisticated now days. With  countries  breaking  down  trade  barriers,  companies  can  go  global  in  terms  of possession  of  business  in  other  countries  or  through  franchise.  Business  travelers  are moneyed  and  therefore  require  the  following  services  wherever  they  travel:  Hotels  of\n\n",

Today,  countries  want  to  maintain  good diplomatic  relations  with  other  countries  to  promote  trade  and  culture  and  goodwill. Regular travelling under exchange programmers takes place to keep in touch and to help each other in the progress of mankind and in improving mutual relationship. Government delegations  are  normally  hosted  by  the  state  who  may  book  hotel  accommodation  to house them. Some host a state banquet in the premises. Obviously such groups will need security, translation services, multilingual front-office staff and perfect service.\n\nEducation: Education as a reason for travel was a state-sponsored tradition throughout the  ancient  times.  We  know  that  Hindu  temples,  Buddhist  monasteries  and  Islamic madarsas  went  beyond  religion  to  educate  their  people.  They  provide  boarding  and lodging to visiting scholars.\n\nHealth: Health has become a new reason for travel. The purpose to travel for health is: Many travel to access the best hospitals worldwide for specialized medical, dental  and surgical care. This type of travel arisen of the high cost of healthcare in the industrialized nations.\n\nPeople  visit  health  resorts  to  get  into  better  shape.

Game parks are the men made attractions motivate people to travel.\n\nReunion: Reunions  are  a  major  reason  for  travel.  They  are  created  for  the  following reasons:\n\nOverseas  employment:  With  people  working  in  other  countries  due  to  global opportunities of employment, the return home for family reunions is a strong motivation.\n\nOverseas education: Similarly, children who left home for international work, education and assignments touch base with their loved ones at Christmas, Thanks giving, Easter or national holidays and religious festivals.\n\nFraternity get-togethers: Another type of reunion is the alma of schools, colleges and higher universities. These reunions take place when students have advanced in age and reached economic self-sufficiency to finance these get-togethers anywhere in the world, especially in exotic locations.\n\nMilitary unions are another reason for travel.\n\nSpecial interest groups: Special interest groups are those who travel in pursuit of their hobby. There is no limit to special interest groups who have connected with each other over the web to make the exchange of interest easier continents. Some popular choices are:\n\nOrnithologists who  pursue  their  interest  in  rare  birds  some  of  which  are  only found in certain locations. Many may opt for travelling to appreciate both old and modern architectural constructions.\n\nWildlife  has  become  a  popular  interest  and  people  go  to  safari  parks  where animals are conserved from extinction. The Kenya National Park is world famous for  African  wild  animals;  the Jim  Corbett  Park is  known  for  the  Kumaon  tiger; while  enthusiasts  handle  around  Kaziranga  National  Park  in  India  see  the  onehorned rhino. Whether they ride by elephants or modern utility vehicles, the thrill is immense.\n\nShopping: This is  a  another major attraction for anyone visiting new places. There are many objectives when shopping: like\n\nTo gather mementos of their visit to a place. For Example - travelers would buy cuckoo clocks in Switzerland or the Masai Spear in Kenya.\n\nTo get bargain. People seek bargains at places like Singapore and Dubai who have set the lead in making the state a destination for shopping. With innovative shopping festivals they attract people from around the world.\n\nTo purchase commercial equipment.\n\nCuriosity:The curiosity of a person moving from known are as to unknown areas, from known cultures to unknown cultures motivates him to travel to gain new memories.\n\nVisit friends and relatives (VFR):This has also been an important reason for travel to meet their friends and relatives, since people travel by their own conveyance thee days, mainly roadside catering and motels etc are benefited by this in most of the cases.\n\nFairs & Festivals: The sea also motivates people to travel like national and international fairs  such  as  Pushkar  Mela,  craft  Mela,  International  Trade  Fairs,  several  Expos  and festival like Holi Diwali, Eid etc.\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The importance of tourism, therefore, is broad and encompasses a number of activities.\n\nEconomic Importance: Tourism industry is one of the influential type of industry in the world. According to -Lickorish and Kershaw‖ of the American Chamber of Commerce, -There  are  three  ways  basically  of  increasing  the  wealth  and  business  activities  of  a country  and  they  are  agriculture  development,  industrial  development  and  tourism development of the country. Here it is important to understand the term  Multiplier Effect:\n\nTourism  Multiplier .  As  the  tourist  comes  to  visit  the  destination,  he  spends money  on  fooding,  lodging  and  purchasing  local  items  etc,  Money  spent  by  a\n\ntourist, is not exhausted in a single stroke. It continues to circulate in the economy through  at  a  descending  rate  for  sometimes  before  it  finally  disappears  because some of it is  exported  outside  the  country  for  import  of  goods  and  services  for sometime before it finally disappears. The multiplier process is possible because of  the  fact  that  one  man's  consumption  is  another  man's  income.  Thus  when  a tourist spends say Rs. 1,000/- on food, entertainment and other activities, this in turn becomes for F and B department, the entertainment department and any other department  which  provided  the  product  or  services.  The  money  does  not  get blocked here because of the fact that money is considered as a liquid asset. These respective  departments  then  spend  this  money  on  various  commodities.  This consumption  by  the  departments  then  again  becomes  income  for  some  other people. Thus the multiplier process continues and trickles down in to the nation's economy.\n\nForeign Currency :It is a source of earning foreign currency by the money spent by the international tourists\n\nSources of public as well as private income: Tourism industry is the source of income for both public also well as private sector government charges tax, sales tax, service tax etc. which is known as government revenue is the income of public. And handicraft, arts etc  are  the  things  that  attract  tourist  and  most  of  them  buy  them  and  the  seller  makers some profit which is called private income.\n\nTax earnings. :The  governments of almost all countries have always shown interest in the  financial  gains  through  tourism  industry.  The  infusion  of  tourist  earning  in  to  an economy as local income makes it accessible to income and other taxes. Depending upon the tax and fiscal policies govern derives sustainable income from tourist industries and direct and indirect taxes are levied on different forms of income and economic activities.\n\nNational Economy: It  directly  helps  in  developing  the  economy  of  the  country  as  the tourists spend money while staying, coming and visiting a country or destination.\n\nEmployment Opportunities: Tourism industry is also one of the influential sectors. It generates  employment  opportunities.  It  provides  employment  to  unskilled,  semi-skilled and skilled manpower. Guide, load man etc are the personal or labour required in Tourism industry.\n\nInfrastructural Development: The infrastructural development of the country is another important  benefit  of  tourism.

      "content": "Cultural Exchange: Tourism is a big motivator for the promotion of culture and spreads the cultural values of the host country to the visitors, who in turn when they go back talk and discuss with others. Culture of a country includes various things such as life style, music,  dance,  food,  architecture,  art  and  many  other  such  things.  Tourism  helps  in spreading all these to various parts of the world over. India is one country which has very old and rich heritage and culture and is probably the only country with diversified culture. Properly planned it can be the biggest tourism asset of country. Thus Tourism industry facilities cultural exchange tourist carry over various cultural concepts of other countries where they visit. Thereby the cultures of different places can be known and exchanged through  tourism.  Local  people  can  learn  their  language,  art,  skill,  culture  etc  and  vice versa.\n\nRegional  Development: Regional  development  is  another  very  important  aspect  of impact of tourism. The more the region or area is visited by that tourist (both domestic and  international)  the  more  the  area  or    region  needs  to  be  developed  and  thus development has to be in all fields and sector, be it historical places, hotels, picnic spots, roads  or  airports,  railway  connections  and  environment,  etc.  Such  expenditure  is  of special significance in marginal areas which are relatively isolated, economically under developed and has unemployment problems.\n\nEducational significance of tourism :  Not  only  in  the  present  age  has  tourism  been  of great  importance  for  education  always.  Many  such  example  of  university  such  as, Takshila and Nalanda, etc. are there in India and also like Alexandria and Greece have been  centers  of  education  in  ancient  tunes.  Its  beneficial  effects  are  in  the  close  and friendly contact between people of different races.\n\nImage Building of Nation: Tourism helps in building the image of country; of course the same image will be carried over what we project. For Example, a tourist coming to India may  carry  with  him  a  mixed  image  of  good  and  bad  after  visiting  the  country.  The historical places and monuments, etc. form a good image while at the same time the way they are maintained their approach roads (which if are poorly maintained) the inadequate transportation  facilities,  poor  accommodation  facilities,  etc.  might  project  a  bad  image. The age old culture and religion and heritage may project a good image while the greedy priests  and  beggar  and  touts  at  such  places  will  project  a  negative  image.  Each  year millions  of  people  travel  to  foreign  countries,  and  their  visit  afford  opportunities  to understand each other.\n\nNational Integration: It  helps  in  development  of  peace,  oneness  and  unity  among  the people of a nation.\n\nEnvironmental Awareness: People become aware on environmental neatness, protection and peace in order to develop tourism.\n\nForeign Languages: By the help of tourism, we can get chance to learn the languages of different places and countries.\n\n",

      "content": "The history of travel is a great landmark in the field of tourism industry. Travel is as old as mankind. From the time of immemorial, people started the traveling due to the various reason. It may be the purpose of the economic, social, cultural, spiritual achievement of the human being. Travel in the earlier times, however, was not undertaken for the purpose of  pleasure since the motive was not to seek any holiday from the work situation. The primary  motive  for  which  travel  was  undertaken  related  to  trade,  commerce  and  the activities associated with it. No travel formalities existed as there were no frontiers. The history of travel can be summarized into:\n\nThe Early Travel: Since the beginning of the civilization there have the evidence that, human beings were moving in the search of food and shelter which is the basic feature of mankind. We have the historical evidence about the movement of people since the time immemorial.. In Neolithic age of 10,000 B.C. mankind started the settled life, agriculture, and  so  many  activities  for  the  betterment  of  comfortable  life.In  around  Egypt  sailing vessels were built in 4000 B.C. Sumerians knew the use of wheel & money around 3500 BC and used it in trade and commerce purpose. Shulgi of Babylonia constructed the rest houses for the travelers. Thus the trade and commerce relations were developed from East to West. Westerners imported the spices, silk etc. from the Easterners.\n\nSilk  Routes. Thus  Trade  first  motivated  to  travel  and  travelers  needed  more  and  more comfort  during  their  travel,  like  accommodation  catering,  health  etc.  As  a  result  Pvt. Organizations were emerged and it resulted in the following developments.\n\nPleasure Travel: After the ending part of the early travel, the Rome Empire reached their apex of the glory. Hence it is marked that the Roman people started the concept of the travel  for  pleasure.  They  travelled  as  they  have  ample  money  and  time.  Besides  that Roman people were Best Patron of art, learning and literature etc. There are examples of the  silk  route  from  Mediterranean  sea  to  Pacific  Ocean  consist  of  12,000  Km.  It  was connected by the older prosperous cities like Rome, Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India,  China,  like  this.  Some  intellectuals  of  that  period  remained  busy  in  creative activities due to their curiosity. The pleasure travel period came to an end due to the fall of the Roman Empire in (400-500 A.D.)\n\nEvents  of  Traveling  in  Ancient  India: Pilgrim  travel  assumed  a  great  importance  in India also. Ashoka traveled a great deal in his eagerness to spread doctrines of Buddha. Ashoka and his entourage first traveled to Nepal starting from Patliputra than to Lumbini Gardens, followed by the Kapilvastu, than Sarnath, from here he travel to Gaya, where Buddha got enlightenment. Through his travels, Emperor Ashoka had special memorials set up at each spot and also he set up the rest houses where traveler could rest. Later on following  his  legacy  several  other  rulers  also  built  institutions  and  Dharamshalas  for travelers. Rest  houses,  monasteries  and  temples  were  also  built  for  pilgrims.\n\n",

During the rule of the Guptas, there was free access to the ports along the Western Coast, seaborne commerce with Europe through Egypt was yet another reason for travel in and around the country.

Thus Travel and tourism is made up of different components which work together to provide holidays and other travel products to clients.\n\nThese are most important components in tourism industry are:\n\nThe components of travel and tourism can be broadly divided into six key areas:\n\nAccommodation  (Lodging  and  Catering): This  components  consists  of  those  who provide accommodation to the people in the form of hotels, resorts, apartments, camps, guest houses etc. The accommodation may be marketed individually or through the tour operators  in  the  form  of  package.

It may be a huge theme park, a museum, a gallery,  a  heritage  building,  an  educational  center  etc.  Many  countries  see  the  need  to have  one  or  more  visitor  attraction  in  the  area  to  widen  their  appeal  and  attract  huge potential tourist.\n\nTravel  Agent: A  travel  agent  provides  information  to  the  people  on  various  travel destinations,  advises  them  of  available  holiday  packages  to  suit  their  tastes  and  budget and  chart  their  travel  plan.

      "content": "The invention of the currency and the wheel sometime in the fifth century BC is regarded as  the  two  main  factors  that  led  to  the  emergence  of  inn-keeping  and  hospitality  as  a commercial activity. While Europe can safely be regarded as the cradle of organized hotel business, it is in the American continent that one sees the evolution of the modern hotel industry over the past century. From the rudimentary ancient inns to the present day stateof-the-art establishments that provide everything under the sun to the modern traveler, the hotel industry has come a long way. The origin and growth of the hotel industry in the world can be broadly studied under the following periods:\n\nAncient Era: It  is  believed  that  inns  were  originated  in  6th  century  B.C.  but  the  real beginning of inn in the history goes back to 12th century, though existence of the oldest sheltering system was seen in Pompeii, south Italy in 79 A.D. Rome was considered holy, place and epicenter of loyalty to all religious people in Europe. For such pilgrimage, the destination to Rome had gradually been increased, and there was a great need of shelter for such people who were travelling all across and reaching their to visit the holy place. Hence the earlier recorded evidence of the hospitality facilities in Europe dates back to 500  BC.  Ancient  cities,  such  as  Corinth  in  Greece,  had  a  substantial  number  of establishments that offered food and drink as well as beds to travelers. The inns of the biblical era were of primitive type, offering a cot or bench in the corner of a room and at times, even a stable. Travelers used to stay in a large hall. Privacy and personal sanitation were  non-existent.  In  the  third  century  AD,  numerous  lodging  premises  mushroomed along the extensive network of brick-paved roads throughout Europe and minor Asia (part of Asia adjoining Europe). The lodging houses were known as mansionis during that time\n\nThese  conditions  prevailed  for  several  hundred  years,  till  the  Industrial  Revolution  in England  led  to  the  development  of  railways  and  steamships,  making  travelling  more efficient,  comfortable and faster. The Industrial Revolution also bought about a shift in the focus of travel that became more business -oriented than educational or social. Inn keeping  was  now  changed  into  commercial  enterprise  providing  room,  food  and\n\nentertainment for travelers.  Inn  keepers earned profit from providing  lodging  and catering services to different travelers. And by the 16th century, the concept  of  hospitality was developed.\n\nThe  real  beginning  of the semi-modern lodging  industry  may be traced back to 1640 A.D.  when  the  first passenger carrying state  coach  began  to operate in England and similarly in other areas of Europe's  and  an organized hotel keeping,  as  we  see  it today, was taken up by\n\nFigure 1.2 A Swiss Chalet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemerging nations of Europe, especially Switzerland.

Between  1750  and  1825,  inns  in  Britain  gained  the  reputation  of  being  the  finest hospitality establishment.\n\nGrand Tour: The second half of the eighteenth century, prior to the French Revolution (1789-99), is referred as the ‗golden era of travel' as the popularity of the ‗Grand Tour' gave  a  big  push  to  the  hotel  industry.  In  those  days,  a  Grand  Tour  of  the  European continent  constituted  an  indispensable  element  of  the  education  of  scions  of  wealthy families  in  Britain.

      "content": "In India the concept of shelter for travelers is not new. In fact, it is as old as its recorded in history though the origin of hotel industry in India cannot be fixed into particular time frame as The historical records are replete with mention of viharas, dharamshalas, sarais, musafirkhanas,  etc.  because  as  per  the  sources  it  has  started    showing  its  marks  from during Indus valley civilization  and Vedic Era. It is believed that in older days  people used to travel mainly for pilgrimage and trade. The concept of Char Dhaam (visiting the religious places located in all four corners of India) or all the religious places in India are the  important  indicators  of  the  significance  according  to  pilgrimage  by  our  ancestors. Even Ancient texts and literature and also in Hindu mythology there are many references to  travel  and  the  provision  of  accommodation  facilities  for  travelling  pilgrimages  and traders by the authorities of those days.\n\nAncient India was called as -Bird of the Gold‖ as it was well known for its richness in silk,  spices,  gems  stones  and  gold  and  records  of  famous  travelers  have  shown  that several  rulers  have  got  attracted  and  have  established  trading  relations  with  different countries.\n\nThus movement of people for both political and pilgrimage stressed the need for better and improved facilities to cater to the varied needs of the various classes of the society.In India, development of lodging and catering can also be attributed also to the legacy left by people  belonging  to  different  cultures  and  ethnic  groups  who  have  ruled  her. Development of Hotels in India as we see it today is chiefly due to the British, who had introduced hotels and restaurants similar to those found in Europe.With the revolution in the modes of transport leading to the evolution of hotel industry in the world development is seen in India also which is divided into three Periods/Era:\n\nAncient Era or Medieval Era: The beginning of hospitality sector in India starts with the  belief  of  -Atithi    Devo    Bhava‖  (Guest  is  God).  While  it  is  not  clear  that  when hospitality  emerged  in  as  commercial  activity  in  India  there  are  a  proofs  of accommodation facilities for  travelers  and  guests  though  not  as  organized  as  we  see  it today.  The ancient Buddhist monks were probably the first to institutionalize the concept of a shelter in India. The cave temples scattered all over the south-western region of India have both a chaitya (sanctuary) for worship and prayer and a vihara (monastery). These monks, although living in their quiet surroundings, away from towns and villages, were nevertheless mindful of the needs of travelers and pilgrims who found shelter and food at these  monasteries.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  these  monasteries  are  located  on  the ancient  trade  routes  between  important  deities  of  the  region.  It  is  gathered  from  some inscriptions that merchants gave liberal donations for the construction and maintenance of these establishments. Mere charity was obviously not the motivation in these displays of generosity. The trader travelled with their merchandise and money on these routes and the viharas  were  their  hotels.  In  the  medieval  period  this  ancient  institution  gradually assumed  a  more  secular  character.  Although  religious  centers  invariably  had dharamshalas  and  musafir  khanas  attached  to  them,  the  caravanserai  appeared  as  an exclusive traveler's lodge with a nanbai or cook attached with it.\n\nWith the passage of time and with increase in movement of people from one to another several  lodging  houses  were  built.  In  India  lodging  houses  in  were  known  as -Dharamshala‖  (Religion  House/School)  which  were  taken  care  by  local  resident  and were  built  in  and  around  village  chaupals,  which  served  as  the  meeting  ground  for villagers  to  plan  and  discuss  various  social  welfare  and  development  measures.  Theses becomes the places of lodging as travelers  started  putting  up  camp  there  due  to  safety reasons.  Gradually  with  the  help  of  zamindars  and  other  influential  people  permanent structure of Dharamshala were build for the travelers. Hence they were provided with safe and secure place to relax and spend the night.\n\nIn the medieval period between 11and13th centuries many sarai and musafirkhanas were build  primarily  as  the  resting  place  for  the  travelers  while  slowly  and  gradually,  the medieval  period  in  the  ancient  institution  gradually  assumed  a  more  secular  character.

However,  he  was  not alone in this venture. The slave or Mamluk dynasty and later The Mughals built the brick paved roads which make travel easy and thus opened Sarais all over their empire.\n\nLater kings, rajas, nawabs, rich businessmen and philanthropists built sarais making travel less  painful  With  the  expansion  of  commerce,  travelling  became  profitable  and  with  it emerged  the  business  of  providing  comfortable  shelter  and  good  food  to  the  growing number of travelers.\n\nColonial Era: At approximately the same time, the inn was the Western counterpart of India's  sarais.  The  sarais  in  India  like  inns  in  Europe  or  the  stagecoach  stations  in  the USA of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries stood all along the well-travelled routes. They provided food and shelter to the travelers and fodder to their horses. The amenities these  early  hotels  offered  would  seem  to  us  to  be  primitive  but  they  conformed  to  the lifestyle of that age.\n\nWith the passage of time the age-old institution of the sarai or the inn adapted itself to the ever-changing and constantly growing requirements of the market and has evolved into the modern hotel. From the age of the bullock cart and horses through the age of the rail road into the era of the jumbo jet and supersonic aircraft, the hotel industry developed with the simultaneous development of transportation systems. It also reflects the standard of living and the lifestyle of the society in which it operates. The development of hotel industry in India is also continuous and satisfactory. The British introduced hotels in India mainly for their  own  use  or  for  foreign  visitors.  Thus  the  organized  existence  of  hotel industry  in  India  took  place  during  colonial  period  with  the  arrival  of  Europeans  or Britishers, who settled back in India.\n\nAmong the  first  such  Inns  were  Portuguese  Georges,  paddy  Goose's  which  opened  in Bombay but with the changes in the world these Inns disappeared and hotel came into existence The credit for opening the first Western-style hotel in India is in the name of British Hotel/ Victoria hotel in Mumbai in 1840 goes to Pallanjee Pestonjee who is the pioneer of Western-style hotels in India. The Auckland Hotel in Kolkata was started in 1843 and in 1858 it was renamed as the Great Eastern Hotel. Another hotel was Watson Hotel, which was exclusively for Europeans and Esplande Hotel in 1871.But there were no Indian Hotels in India\n\nIn December 1903 Jamshed Ji Nusserwanji Tata built Taj Mahal Palace refer fig 1.7 and Tower Hotel having a view of Gateway of India in Mumbai, overlooking the Gate Way of India  after  facing  an  insult  on  racial  discrimination  from  Waston  Hotel  as  he  was  not allowed to enter for being an Indian.

They are usually autonomous.\n\nProprietary  ownership: It  is  the  direct  ownership  of  one  or  more  properties  by  one person or company. Small lodging properties that are owned and operated by a couple or family are common example of proprietary ownership. Large properties that are owned by major international hotel companies such as Hilton belong to this category. A group of Hotels that are owned or managed by one company is called a chain. Chains: When one hotel realizes that they can offer the same services in other cities, chains of the same hotel are  opened  in  those  places.  Hotel  chain  is  an  enterprise  that  administrates,  through  a unique management a number of hotels located in different areas. They can be total or partial  owners  of  the  hotel  and  they  manage  their  administration,  marketing  and promotion.  This  gives  them  the  advantages  of  a  large  central  organisation  providing reservation  systems,  management's  aids,  financial  strength,  expertise,  manpower, specialties,  merchandises and promotional help. Some of the chain companies are Inter Continental Hotel Groups (IHG), Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Accor, Hilton Hotel  Corp.,  Best  Western  International,  and  Resorts,  and  TUI  AG/TUI  Hotels  and Resorts. A chain is usually classified as operating under a management contract or as a franchise or referral group.\n\nManagement Contracts: It  is  a contract between the owner of the property and a hotel operator (management contractor) by which the owner employs the operator as an agent to assume the full responsibilities for operating and managing the hotel. The operator can be  a  hotel  chain  with  reputed  name  and  market  image  ,such  as  Hilton  ,Sheraton  ,best western ,choice hospitality, etc.\n\nFranchise: It is the authorization given by a company to another company or individual to sell its unique product /services and use its trademark according to the guidelines given by former, for a specified time, and a specified place. Under it the owner operates as a member of the chain, utilizing the brand image, name, and goodwill and obtaining for a certain fee. Few other terms also needs to be clear here:\n\nFranchisor: The franchisor is the company that owns the trade mark, product and business pattern\n\nFranchisee: The  franchisee  is  the  company  to  whom  the  franchisor  allows  the right to do business under its name as per his conditions\n\nFranchising: A continuous relationship in which franchisor gives licenses to do the business under its name and also assist in organizing, training, merchanding etc in return of the fees\n\nIn  hospitality  industry  several  big  chains  are  operating  on  franchise  basis  at  act  as  a mutual benefit for both the party, the franchisor allows franchisee to use his idea, brand name, logo, methods to do the business and in return the franchisee pay the fees and also assure to abide by the quality standards, product specification of franchisor\n\nSome  of  the  franchising  companies  are  Holiday  Inn,  Choice  international, Ramada,\n\nManagement  contract: managing  a  hotel  requires  professional  expertise  .a  new entrepreneur  with  little  or  no  experience  of  market  may  safely  decides  to  take  the franchise of bigger hotel so as to run the business but the record till be the problems in operating the business the franchisor will only provide the logo brand name, tested and successful operating system, training program, marketing and reservation assistance but does not provide well equipped trained manpower- experienced  managers and employees necessary to run the business. t bridge the gap management contract concept gets in these companies  provides  the  required  expertise  to  manage  the  hotel  operation  management fees, even sometimes the on a percentage of gross revenue\n\nThus management contract as the name suggest is a contract between the owner of the property and management contractor (hotel operator) by which the owner employees the operator as a management to take the full responsibility of operating and managing the hotel. Exampel : Hilton, Sheraton, bestwester, choice hospitality etc\n\nReferral Groups: It consists of independent hotel which have grouped together for some common purpose. Though the properties in the referral group may be different from each other  but  there  is  sufficient  consistency  in  the  quality  of  service  to  satisfy  guest expectations.  The  member  hotels  recommend  guest  to  other  member  hotels.  Some examples  are  Best  Western  international,  one  of  the  largest  hotel  chains,  is  the  best example of referral groups.\n\nTime -Share Hotels: A  new  concept  of  ownership  also  called  vacation  ownership  or holiday ownership concepts, mushrooming up in resorts areas like hills, beaches, forest. As  the  name  suggest,  it  entails  purchasing  a  tourist  accommodation  at  a  popular destination for a particular time slot in a year which can be week or weeks. Each room or suite is owned by several people who will schedule their visits well in advance with the management office to ensure that the room or suites is available or rent a unit to other vacationers if they cannot avail the facility.

Later  on  Buddhist monasteries provided boarding and lodging to travelers. During Chandra Gupta Maura's Reign, inns and guest houses were established. Then some universities like Taxila also provided accommodation to Buddhist monks and such places were called Chaityas.\n\nIn India too the development of hotel industry is closely linked to travel. In India travel was mainly on animals (mule, horse and camel) and for rest during their travel at strategic points  Dharamshalas,  Sarais,  Chaupals  of  Panchayatas,  Chowltry  (in  South  India)  and temples  and  religious  places  were  provided  by  rich  people  such  as  Rajas,  Kings, Zamindars  etc.  Usually  free  accommodation  and  food  for  travelers  was  given.  During medieval period it was mandatory for the state authorities to provide foor and shelter to the  wayside  traveler.  Gradually  there  was  a  set  up  of  hotel  chains  in  India  which  laid more stress on the precise architectural features, organization, standards of their member hotels  but  some  others  focused  on  advertising,  marketing,  purchasing,  human  resource development, etc. The first luxurious hotel by Pallanjee Pestonjee (1840) was started in Bombay.  It  was  famous  for  its  excellent  cuisine,  beersand  wines  and  itys  excellent management.  Later  on  he  opened  another  hotel  at  Fort  in  Bombay.

In  numerous  occasions  Tata  Group pioneered the way as firsts in Indian industry. To leverage the value of the Tata brand, the thrust  of  the  group‗s  business  has  shifted  from  a  product-driven  to  a  brand  driven portfolio.

The Indian Hotel Company. Mumbai was  incorporated  on  1st  April,  1902  with  an  authorized  capital  of  Rs.  30  lakh.  Mr. Jamsetji Tata opened the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. The idea was born as long ago as 1888, because of a friend‗s disparaging remark that Mumbai could not boast of a single decent hotel. Jamsetji Tata searched the capitals of Europe and bought the best. As far back as 1888, he made sure the Taj would have its own laundry, aerated water-bottling plant,  electroplating  for  its  silverware,  a  Mora  silver  burnishing  machine,  crockery, washing plant and elevators, fellowship and trade and industry and there by to enhance the prosperity of the nation was the objective underlying the project undertaken by him. He knew that the hotel would have to be maintained for years as a losing concern, but the spirit of patriotism and consciousness of duty to the country demanded that he should not count the cost of providing what he regarded as a pre-requisite for the future growth of the  country  and  development  of  her  commerce  as  well  as  cultural  relations  and  cooperation with the advanced countries of the world. Accordingly, foundation was laid in 1988  and  the  construction  of  the  building  completed  in  1903.  Fronting  the  harbor  and commanding  a  magnificent  view,  open  to  sea  breeze  and  valued  service,  the  hotel rendered the country proud as being one of the largest by hotels in the East. It isso well known over the world that nothing more remains to be said about it. According to legend, the architect of the Taj, a Frenchman, spent long hours finalizing his conceptual drawings, then shipped off to France to recuperate. On his return he found the hotel completed in every detail with one small exception: it was located back to front. So the Frenchman did what any artistic soul would do. He did away with his body by shooting himself in the head. The hotel was completed at a cost of Rs. 5, 00,000 in 1904, but he did not live to preside  at  the  opening  ceremony.  In  it‗s  over  100  years  since  then,  the  old  gracious building has accommodated some of the best-known persons in modern history. Fronting the  Mumbai  harbor  and  over-looking  the  Gate  Way  of  India,  it  was  until  recently  the largest hotel in the east. It is rated amongst the top ten hotels in the world by the Fortune Magazine.  India‗s  great  industrialist,  Jamsetji  Tata,  felt  that  it  was  essential  for advancement of Mumbai city in particular and India in general, that it should have an up to-date hotel to provide facilities and comforts to visitors from all parts of the world. Not to  make  a  profitable  investment,  but  to  attract  visitors  from  overseas  with  a  view  to promoting.\n\n",

As of January 2009 Hilton  brands  encompass  3,200  hotels  with  545,000  rooms  in  77  countries.  Hilton  is ranked as the 43rd largest private company in the United States by Forbes.The company owns, manages or franchises a portfolio of  brands,  including  Hilton  Hotels  &  Resorts, Conrad Hotels, Doubletree, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hampton Inn, Hampton Inn & Suites, Hilton  Garden  Inn,  Hilton  Grand  Vacations  Company,  Homewood  Suites  by  Hilton, Home2 Suites by Hilton and The Waldorf-Astoria Collection. It was founded by Conrad Hilton  in  Cisco,  Texas  and  was  headquartered  in  Beverly  Hills,  California  from  1969 until  2009.  The  company  moved  to  Tysons  Corner,  unincorporated  Fairfax  County, Virginia, near McLean in August 2009.\n\nHISTORY: Conrad  Hilton  founded  the  original  company  in  1919  with  one  hotel  in Cisco, Texas. The Hotels name is Mobley Hotel. The company separated its international operations  into  a  separate  traded  company  on  December  1,  1964,  known  as  Hilton International  Co.  In  1967  Trans  World  Corp.,  the  holding  company  for  Trans  World Airlines, acquired the separated company. In 1986 it was sold to UAL Corp., the holding company  for  United  Airlines,  who  became  Allegis  Corp.  in  an  attempt  to  re-incarnate itself as a full service travel company encompassing Westin Hotels and Hertz rental cars in addition to Hilton International and United Airlines. In 1987 after a corporate putsch, the renamed UAL Corp. sold Hilton International to Ladbroke Group plc, a British leisure and gambling company, which in May 1999 adopted the name Hilton Group plc. As a result, there were two separate, fully independent companies operating hotels under the Hilton name. Those Hilton Hotels outside the US were, until recently, styled as Hilton International hotels. In addition, for many years hotels run by the Hilton Group in the US were  called  Vista  International  Hotels,  while  hotels  operated  by  the  American  arm  of Hilton outside the US were named Conrad Hotels. The Vista chain has been phased out, while  Conrad  is  now  restyled  as  one  of  the  luxury  brands  of  Hilton  (along  with  The Waldorf-Astoria  Collection)  and  operates  hotels  within  the  US,  as  well  as  abroad.  To minimize  consumer  confusion,  the  American  and  British  Hilton  companies,  from  the 1990s onwards, had a joint marketing agreement under which they shared the same logos, promoted each others' brands and maintained joint reservation systems.\n\nIn 1971, Hilton acquired International Leisure Company, including the Las Vegas Hilton and Flamingo Hilton. On December 29, 2005, Hilton Hotels Corporation agreed to reacquire the Hilton International chain from its British owner, Hilton Group plc, for GBP 3.3 billion (or $5.71 billion). As well as bringing the two Hilton companies back together as a single entity, this deal also included Hilton plc properties operating as Conrad Hotels, Scandic Hotels  and  Living  Well  Health  Clubs. On  February  23,  2006,  the  deal  closed, making Hilton Hotels the world's fifth largest hotel operator in number of rooms. Hilton Group PLC (headquartered in the UK) then renamed itself  Ladbrokes plc.  In  February 2009, Hilton Hotels Corp., announced that its headquarters were moving from its three buildings  on  Civic  Center  Drive  in  Beverly  Hills  to  Fairfax  County,  Virginia,  located between  Washington,  D.C.  and  Dulles  International  Airport.  Just  across  the  Potomac River  is  Montgomery  County,  Maryland,  home  to  a  number  of  Hilton's  competitors including Marriott International, Ritz-Carlton, Host Hotels & Resorts, and Choice Hotels, and  was  also  considered  for  the  relocation  along  with  Washington.  The  move  was expected following to the 2007 acquisition, in order for the headquarters to be nearer to The Blackstone Group's New York headquarters.\n\n",

At  the  time,  Paul Dubrule and Gérard Pélisson were both living in the United States,  working for  major computer  firms.  They  went  into  business  together,  and  in  1967,  founded  the  SIEH (Société d'investissement et d'exploitation hôteliers) hotel group. Having seen the success of  American  lodging  properties  in  suburban  areas  and  along  major  highways,  Dubrule and Pélisson opened their first American-style Novotel hotel outside of Lille in northern France. In 1974, they launched the Ibis brand with the opening of the Ibis Bordeaux. The following  year,  SIEH  acquired  the  Courtepaille  and  Mercure  brands,  and  in  1980  the Sofitel hotel brand, which then consisted of 43 hotels. Two years later, in 1982, the SIEH bought out Jacques Borel International, the then world-leading brand offering restaurant vouchers.\n\nSustainable  development: In  October  2009,  Accor  was  ranked  number  one  for sustainability among  the  world‗s  10  largest  hotel  groups.

Later,  the  motel  chain  operated simply under the name Quality Motels (1969-71) and Quality Inns (since 1972). Quality Courts  United  accepted  franchise  hotels  without  strict  norms  or  guidelines  from  the company.  This  is  different  from  Holiday  Inn  which  from  their  early  beginnings implemented  numerous  mandatory  standards  and  guidelines  (e.g.  room  size  and amenities)  at  every  one  of  their  locations.  Also,  Quality  Inn  accepted  franchisees  with existing hotels. During its early years, Quality Courts' operations were entirely in areas of the  U.S.  east  of  the  Mississippi  River  and  portions  of  Canada.  From  1946  to  1964, Quality had a marketing partnership with Best Western, whose properties were located mostly  west  of  the  Mississippi  River,  and  thus  not  in  direct  competition  with  Quality. While this partnership made sense geographically, it did not work well in the long run, and was abandoned in 1964 as Best Western expanded into the Eastern U.S. with its Best Eastern operation (which was replaced by a nationwide Best Western operation in 1967). Quality Courts began its efforts toward national coverage in 1966 when it opened a motel in St. Louis, Missouri and two in Texas at Houston and Arlington.\n\nThe  company  became  Quality  International  as  the  company  switched  to  franchising  in 1972.

This  small  and  informal  network  eventually  grew  into  the  modern  Best Western hotel chain founded by M.K. Guertin in 1946.\n\nThe name \"Best Western\" was a result of most of their properties originally being located in  the  Western  part  of  the  United  States  west  of  the  Mississippi  River.  From  1946  to 1964, Best Western had a marketing partnership with Quality Courts, the forerunner of the chain known today as Quality Inns, whose properties were located mostly east of the Mississippi  River,  and  thus  not  in  direct  competition  with  Best  Western.  While  this partnership made sense geographically, it did not go over well in the long run, and was abandoned. In 1964, Best Western launched an expansion effort of its own operations east of the Mississippi by using the moniker \"Best Eastern\" for those properties with the same typestyle and Gold Crown logo as \"Best Western.\" By 1967, the \"Best Eastern\" name was dropped  and  all  motels  from  coast-to-coast  got  the  \"Best  Western\"  name  and  Gold Crown, a move that would further enhance an already successful marketing brand into the \"World's  Largest  Hotel  Chain\"  by  the  1970s.  Best  Western's  \"Gold  Crown\"  logo  was introduced in 1964 and would continue with a few minor revisions over the next 30 years until it was replaced by the current blue and yellow logo in 1994.\n\nBest Western Australia and New Zealand: In 1981, Homestead Motor Inns of Australia affiliated with Best Western. This move put 'International' after the Best Western name. The company has been known as Best Western International ever since. In early 2007, Best Western Australasia took over the rights to operate Best Western properties in New Zealand from the previous company, the Motel Federation of New Zealand. This was a bold but beneficial move for the brand as it made way for better quality properties to be brought  into  the  brand.

Initially, Starwood Lodging owned a number of hotels throughout North America, all under different brand names. The Westin Hotel Company was purchased in 1994 from Aoki Corporation of Japan. Starwood acquired the Sheraton, Four Points by Sheraton, and The Luxury Collection brands from ITT Sheraton in 1998.\n\nIn  1999,  Starwood  launched  their  \"W\"  Hotels  brand.

The  brand  has  expanded internationally  with  properties  opening  first  in  Mexico  City,  Seoul,  and  Istanbul.

It features a futuristic design by architect Ricardo Bofill in the shape of a sail. Standing 26 stories tall, it can be seen from all over the city.

      "content": "Hyatt Corporation is one of the leading hotel companies in North America. Owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago, Hyatt manages or licenses the management of 87 hotels and 16 resorts (with a total of 55,000 rooms) in 83 cities in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean.  In  addition  to  its  resorts,  Hyatt  has  also  developed  other  special  hotel concepts--the Grand Hyatt, the Park Hyatt, and Classic Residence by Hyatt. Grand Hyatts are  large-scale,  higher  priced  hotels  located  in  culturally  rich  cities,  with  three  in  the United  States  (New  York,  San  Francisco,  and  Washington,  D.C.).  Park  Hyatts  are modeled  after  small  European  hotels  and  are  located  in  Chicago,  Los  Angeles,  San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. The Classic Residence by Hyatt properties offers luxury retirement apartments for rental. Starting in the mid-1990s, the company has also sought growth opportunities in franchising, time-share properties, free-standing golf courses, and casinos.\n\nThe Founding Family: While Hyatt's history as a corporate entity dates from 1957, the Pritzker family, who built and controls Hyatt, has been active significantly longer. In the late  19th  century,  the  Pritzkers  immigrated  to  the  United  States  from  the  Ukraine. Patriarch  Nicholas  Pritzker  led  them  to  Chicago,  and  in  1902  he  founded  Pritzker  & Pritzker  (P&P),  the  law  firm  that  was  to  evolve  into  a  management  company  and  the center of the Pritzkers' many and varied investments. P&P grew, and by the late 1920s it had become a respected local firm. At that time, the Pritzkers' best client was Goldblatt Brothers, the low-priced Chicago department store chain. Through the Goldblatts, Abram (A.N.) Pritzker, Nicholas Pritzker's son, met Walter M. Heymann, then a leading Chicago commercial banker and an officer at the First National Bank of Chicago. In succeeding years A.N. Pritzker and Walter Heymann became business associates, and the powerful First National Bank of Chicago became the financial cornerstone of the Pritzker family empire.\n\nHyatt Emerges in the 1950s: The story of Hyatt Corporation begins with the succeeding generation of Pritzkers. By the early 1950s, Pritzker's oldest son, Jay, had become active in the family business. Something of a prodigy, Jay Pritzker had graduated high school at 14.  He  finished  college  soon  thereafter  and  then  took  a  law  degree  from  Northwestern University. During World War II he worked first as a flight instructor and later for the U.S. government agency that managed German-owned companies. In that position, he sat on corporate boards with men many years his senior. An accomplished deal-maker even in his earliest years, Jay would later become well known for his quickness at sizing up balance  sheets  and  offering  deals.  Jay,  beginning  in  1957,  made  the  initial  deals  that formed the basis for Hyatt. Jay's youngest brother, Donald Pritzker, finished law school in\n\n1959, whereupon he joined P&P. Meanwhile, the middle brother, Robert Pritzker, earned an  industrial  engineering  degree  at  the  Illinois  Institute  of  Technology  in  Chicago  and later he and Jay would found and manage the Marmon Group.\n\nIn 1957 Jay Pritzker bought a small Los Angeles International Airport motel named Hyatt House  after  its  original  owner,  Hyatt  von  Dehn.  Within  four  years,  Jay  expanded  the single  property  into  a  chain  of  six  hotels  and  brought  Donald  Pritzker  to  California  as manager  of  operations,  reporting  to  Jay.  The  two  made  a  good  team,  with  Jay's  dealmaking  skills  and  Donald's  managerial  ability  and  gregarious  personality.  Hyatt  grew rapidly  during  its  first  decade,  opening  small  motor  inns  on  the  West  Coast  and  one outside  Chicago.  The  fledgling  company  went  public  in  1967,  but  the  more  important event of that watershed year was the opening in Atlanta of its first hotel with an atrium tower  lobby,  designed  by  the  architect  John  Portman.  The  Portman  atrium  was  a  21storey interior courtyard, designed so that each hotel room entered off the high-rise open space, set off with a central glass elevator leading to all floors, and hanging green vines growing  from  each  floor's  balcony.  The  overall  effect  was  revolutionary,  because  the Portman interior eliminated the impersonal hallway with rows of doors and brought to the hotel  interior  an  open-air  congeniality,  with  the  spin-off  of  greater  safety,  feeling  of security, and warmth. The Portman lobby became the hotel's signature and brought Hyatt to widespread notice for the first time, as well as advancing the concept of public space in buildings.\n\nWhat became the Hyatt Regency Atlanta was part of the 15-building Peachtree Center. The developers of the large hotel property were in financial trouble and both Hilton and Marriott passed up opportunities to purchase the property before Hyatt did and finished construction. Soon after the hotel opened, its occupancy rate reached 94.6 percent. Hyatt grew to a chain of 13 hotels by 1969. That year, the Pritzkers set up a separate company called Hyatt International Corporation to expand the chain overseas, with its first hotel the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong. In 1972, Donald died of a heart attack at the age of 39. Jay installed his brother-in-law, Hugh M. \"Skip\" Friend, Jr., as the new president.\n\nGrowth in the 1970s: The company grew rapidly during the 1970s aided by the signature Hyatt design and the innovations that a young staff was able to devise. Management went wrong,  however,  when  it  was  discovered  in  1977  that  Friend  had  spent  $300,000  of company money on personal expenses.\n\nThe  1980s: In  1980,  Thomas  Jay  Pritzker,  Jay's  son,  became  president,  with  Jay remaining chairman and CEO. The decade started promisingly with three significant firsts in  1980: the openings of the first Park Hyatt, the first Grand Hyatt, and the first Hyatt resort.  Park  Hyatts  were  designed  as  smaller  luxury  hotels  with  a  European  style, featuring  personalized  service,  privacy,  and  elegance;  the  first  one  opened  in  Chicago near the Water Tower. Grand Hyatts were designed for the high-end market in culturally rich  destinations,  and  featured  sophisticated  leisure,  banquet,  and  conference  facilities utilizing the latest technology. Hyatt Resorts werespecially designed to reflect the local area  of  location  and  offered  numerous  activities  and  facilities  for  their  guests;  the  first Hyatt resort was the Hyatt Regency Maui in Hawaii.\n\n",

      "content": "Then in 1981, two skywalks at the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 229 in what the National Bureau of Standards called the most devastating structural collapse ever to take place in the United States. Between 1981 and 1986, more than 2,000 resulting lawsuits were settled for a total of $120 million. In June 1986, 900 individuals remaining in a federal class action suit against the hotel settled all claims for $1,000 each. Ultimately, \"gross negligence and misconduct\" were attributed to engineers Daniel Duncan, Jack Gillum, and their former company, G.C.E. International Inc., whose \"hurry-up\" design system caused them to be pouring concrete on one part of the building while finishing the design on the rest of the building. As was the case with most Hyatt hotels at this time, Hyatt was managing the hotel for its owner and builder, Hallmark Properties, so Hyatt was not held liable. Still it did not help to have the Hyatt name associated with such a disaster. During the decade, Hyatt Corporation also became involved in an indirect way in some of the Pritzkers' nonlodging activities. Most notable was the 1983 purchase of the troubled Braniff airline through Dalfort, a Hyatt subsidiary. Under Dalfort, and with Jay Pritzker taking the lead, Braniff's losses were cut. But after a proposed merger with the also troubled Pan Am Corp. failed in 1987, Braniff was sold the following year.\n\nAlso  in  1989,  Hyatt  introduced  the  Camp  Hyatt  program  to  attempt  to  attract  more families  to  its  somewhat  business-oriented  facilities.  Under  the  program,  Hyatt  hotels began to offer numerous activities geared toward the toddler to preteen set, gave parents the option of taking a half-priced second room for their kids, and added menus and room service tailored for children.\n\n1990s and Beyond: As the 1990s began, Hyatt's growth was somewhat  challenged by what analysts regarded as the reluctance of some owners of new hotels to hire Hyatt as managers, given the relatively high cost of running a glitzy Hyatt hotel. In fact, Hyatt was beginning to run the risk of losing existing contracts. Seeking to streamline operations, the company laid off more than 1,000 of its work force and then embarked on a detailed appraisal  of  the  services  it  was  offering  at  its  hotels.  By  1994,  Hyatt's  gross  operating profits  had  increased  45  percent  from  1990  and  the  company  was  hearing  fewer complaints  from  hotel  owners  about  costs.  Starting  in  1994,  the  company  moved cautiously into franchising for the first time. The first two franchised Hyatts were older hotels--the Hyatt Sainte Claire in downtown San Jose and the Hyatt Regency Pier Sixty Six in Fort Lauderdale. Scheduled to open in 1997 was a third franchised Hyatt, the Hyatt Regency  Wichita,  and  a  new  downtown  convention  hotel.  Hyatt  also  entered,  again cautiously, the crowded time-share property market with the opening in June 1995 of a resort known as Hyatt's Sunset Harbor Key West. Hyatt was reportedly also looking for a site  to  move  into the lucrative  Las  Vegas  gambling mecca.  In addition to its pursuit of these growth opportunities, Hyatt also strived through innovation to retain its role at the forefront  of  the  industry.  In  1994  the  company  tested  automated  check-in  kiosks  in  a number of its hotels. The kiosks, which allowed guests to check themselves in less than one  minute  and  even  dispensed  room  keys,  proved  a  success  and  were  subsequently expanded to other Hyatts. The company also successfully introduced a telephone check-in system.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n",

Hotel room rates fixation is a difficult task.\n\nFactors for deciding a room tariff: Various factors which should be kept in the mind while deciding the room tariff for the hotel are:\n\nCost: The total expenditure that is required in providing services and products to the ultimate consumer of the hotel services is the cost. The total cost can include fixed cost, labour cost and material cost. Tariff should be fixed in such a manner\n\n",

A  hotel  offering  the  best services like spa, gymnasium, banquet halls, specialty restaurants, etc, will charge a higher room rent in comparison to other hotels offering limited services. Even more  the  amenities,  higher  the  standards  and  higher  the  room  rent.  the  star classification of the hotel is also based on level of services, five star or above will have  better  standards  of  services  so  higher  room  rent  as  compared  to  those  of others.\n\nCompetition: Rates  should  be  competitive  with  other  hotels  of  the  same standards  and  providing  the  same  services  and  facilities  in  similar  locations  of city.  Competition  in  the  market  plays  an  important  role  in  determining  the  rack rate of the hotel. The higher the competition, the lower will be the room rent.\n\nCustomer profile: The category of customer coming to your hotel must also be considered .The social status and financial status i.e. paying capacity, of the guest should be kept in mind.\n\nRoom location: The location of the room also affects the room tariff. front rooms or rooms with better and beautiful view would cost higher than other rooms.\n\nLocality: The locality or the area in which hotel is situated also gain importance while fixing the room tariff. As if the hotel is situated in posh locality where all the shopping and other facilities are available and are also approachable to railway or airport will have higher room rates as compared to those located in backward and far off localities.\n\nPublicity: The  amount  of  publicity  done  by  the  hotel  and  special  budget prescribed for hotel publicity also affects in deciding the room rates this type of expanse also need to be adjusted in the room rent as there is no source of return for such expenditure but they helps in increasing the occupancy of the hotel\n\n",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Bases of charging room rent: Once the room tariff has been decided, every hotel has to decide  the  base  for  charging  the  room  rent  i.e.  they  have  to  decide  the  criteria  for establishing the end of the day to post the room charges into the guest account. The end of the day is the arbitrary time which is believed to be the end of the financial transactions for a particular day. As hotel works for 24x7x365 it is essential to fix a time which will be treated as the end of the day and beginning of the new day.\n\nFixed Check-in/checkout Time : Most hotels follow the fixed check-in/checkout system for fixation of tariff in hotel. As per this system, a particular time of the day is fixed as the check-out time or is marked as the end of the day. Generally, it is 12 noon. According to this, the day starts at 12 noon daily and ends at 12 noon the next day, regardless of the\n\ntime at which the guest checks-in. The major advantage of this system of charging the room rent is  that  the  same  room  can  be  sold  more  than  once  in  a  day.  This  system  is normally adopted by commercial hotels. Most of the hotels following this system may allow relaxation of a few hours before and after check-out time in charging the room rent. Since it is not practical for any guest to check in at exactly 1200 hrs, most hotels permit a grace  period  (of  about  2  hours),  before  and  after  checkout  time.  Though  the  system  is good for the hotelier, many guests may think of this system as unreasonable. To ensure renewed patronage by the guests, many hotels today tell a guest that there exists a two hour grace period for check-in or check-out, but actually give a leeway of three hours to avoid disputes. Also, for an early morning check-in after 0600 hrs, instead of a full day extra  to  be  charged,  most  hotels  charge  only  a  half  day's  charges.  Following  the  same systems, when a guest checks-out as late as 1800 hrs, a half day tariff is again charged instead of a full day's charge. The logic that is explained in this system is that the room cannot be sold after that point of the day. For an early morning check-in, the guest could be  told  that  the  room  could  not  have  been  sold  the  previous  night.  However,  the  least amount charged is a minimum of one day's charge.\n\n",

A  room  is  assigned  to  the  guest  for  twenty-  four  hours from the time of his arrival ie As per this system, the guest is entitled to keep his room for a period of 24 hours from the point of the his check-in, for a day's charge and there is no fixed time of arrival for the guest This system is followed in transit hotels and hotels that are located in the vicinity of railway stations, where guests normally stay for few hours. In this system, no relaxation of time is given after the completion of twenty-four hours of stay.\n\nExample 1: Mr. X checks-in at 01:00 pm on Tuesday. He will be charged for one day till 01:00 pm on Wednesday.\n\nExample 2: Mr. Y checks in at 11:00 am of 15th March would be charged for one day till 11:00 am of 16th March\n\nNumber  of  Nights: This  system  of  charging  the  room  rent  is  a  modification  of  the twenty-four  hour  system.

Very much connected to this system of charging is the concept of Day Rate or ‗Day Use Rate'. This is a concessional rate given to guests who do not stay over-night in the hotel.

      "content": "Key Rack : Key rack has sockets to store guestroom keys. They are also called as pigeon hole.  Presently,  with  the  development  in  technology,  we  have  electronic  key  system which can be generated through one console itself and does not require any storage; the extra  space  needed  for  the  keys  is  eliminated.  Those  hotels  which  still  depend  on  key slots; they utilize their space by combining it with mail, and message rack.\n\nMail, and Message Rack :  Even if the mail, and message rack is separated from the key rack, accessibility factor for the person who is responsible for the same is a must. For the mails and messages in a fully automated hotel, it can be retrieved from the room, house phone as the message can be stored through the voice mail system. Even for the delivery of mail, the message for the same can be passed through the electronic message center. The guest gets to know about it through a message light in the room.\n\nReservation Rack :  In a non-automated hotel this rack plays a pivotal role. In this rack, the  guest  information  is  placed  as  per  the  date  of  arrival  and  also  subdivided  in alphabetical  order.  This  system  of  order  is  important  so  as  to  have  a  quick  look  at  the availability  of  the  rooms  for  further  bookings.  In  a  fully  automated  hotel,  this  rack  is eliminated, as the property management system takes over it.\n\nInformation Rack: This rack is used to help the employees to route the mail, messages and other visitor inquiries in a systematic way. To smoothen the functioning, the rack has two listing - one in alphabetical order and other one by room numbers. Again this rack is not required in a fully automated hotel.\n\nFolio Bucket: This tray is kept usually in the non-automated hotel and semi-automated hotel as well, which is kept in ascending order of the room numbers. The placement of folio bucket should be such a way that it can be accessed by both the front office assistant and the cashier, for the updating/posting of transactions of the guest staying in the hotel and  final  billing.  For  the  departed  guest,  who  pays  the  bill  through  credit  card  or  by company account, there is one more folio tray in the accounts department. This folio is closed only after the final payment (when the balance shows zero amount) or if not paid and is declared as bad debt.\n\nPosting Machines :  Semi- automated hotels use posting machines. This machine records transactions, makes account statement, also analyses sales activity and does an audit trail of charge purchase transactions. The advantage here is printed copy of the guest's folio. But the disadvantage and being the major one is that it is prone to errors as it requires a person to update charge manually and difficult to operate. Fully automated do not require posting machines as hotels PMS can do all the work with greater advantages over posting machines.\n\nVoucher  Rack: Once  the  transaction  is  over,  the  vouchers  are  required  for  the  audit process by the accounts department for verification, hence the need of the voucher rack. Ideally  this  should  be  situated  near  the  posting  machine  where  the  cashier  or  the  front desk assistant can access it easily.\n\nCall Accounting System: Call  Accounting System is a software program that helps in processing of calls (outgoing or incoming), pricing them and billing accordingly towards\n\nthe  necessary  account  (guest  account  in  the  guest  folio).  With  this  system,  there  is  no requirement of any phone company operators or staff to place the call. For the activation of phone calls in the guest rooms the front desk clerk has to enter the guest's name and room number into the data bank, which automatically keeps the call charges updated.\n\nCash Register: This is used to record any cash transactions. Today posting machine and computer  have  taken  the  place  of  cash  register  with  the  printing  device  for  producing various cash reports like sales receipts, price control reports etc. There are several keys which  can  be  used  to  record  data  like  amount  of  transaction,  its  type,  concerned department, its purpose, method of payment and so on.\n\nWake-Up Devices: This  is  an  alarm  clock  that  is  used  by  the  front  office  assistant  to remind  them  to  awaken  the  guest  as  per  the  request.  Presently  this  wake  services  are replaced  by  in  room  wake  up  messages  through  computer  interfacing  (automatic  call dispensing system).\n\nLuggage  Trolleys  and  Bell  Hop  Trolleys: It  is  important  that  the  trolleys  are  well maintained, proper greasing and oiling is done in time and in case of brakes, make sure that they function properly. Also make sure that their movements are well controlled and move only in required guided direction. There is no squeaking or rattling noise when the trolleys are moved. However avoid excessive oiling as the oil drops may cause stains on floors  and  carpet  which  may  be  difficult  to  remove  and  may  also  cause  accidents.  The trolleys should fit in easily along with the guest and bellboy without creating overloaded condition in the elevator cage:\n\nTelecommunication Equipment : you may find following telecommunication equipments in hotels:\n\nPBX-  (Private  branch  Exchange) -  this  equipment  takes  inbound  calls  to  the hotels  operator's  console,  through  whom  the  calls  are  further  diverted  to  the respective  areas.  With  these  types  of  systems,  number  of  telephones  lines  is limited. Outbound calls normally do require an operator. Charging of calls is also done  by  the  operator.  With  a  PABX  (private  automated  branch  exchange)  the problem of calculation is eliminated with the usage of individual meters for each extension. The need of the operator is also eliminated.\n\nCall accounting system - this system eliminates the requirements of any telephone company  or  any  operator  for  any  billing  purpose.  As  discussed  above,  it's software.\n\nPager and cellular phones - some hotels give a pager or the cellular phones on rent as soon as guests check in. billing is done according to usage shown in the meter. This system is not diverted through any CAS but is been posted manually.\n\nOther  Equipments: Other  equipments  comprises  of  Fax  machine,  Telex,  credit  card imprinter (automatic as well as manual), credit card validator, time stamp and the latest technology i.e., the call detection system.\n\n",

There are many types of calls a guest may plays during the hotel stay.\n\nWhile all of these calls can be completed without operator assistance,  guests sometime ask front office staff  for assistance in placing calls.   In addition, a single call often fits into more than one category of call. For example, A direct dial long distance call could also credit card call, a person to person call could also be a collect call, a local call could be to an internet service provider and international call could be a person to person credit card call.  For many of these of calls, the hotel can charge guests a surcharge for use of its telephone technology.\n\nLocal Calls: A local terminology with in a local calling area and typically is billed on a per  call  basis  rather  than  a  per  minute  basis.   The  local  phone  company  controls  local telephone  calls.   Hotels  may  charge  guests  on  a  per  call  basis  or  offer  unlimited  local\n\ncalling  for  a  flat  daily  charge.   Some  hotels  don't  charge  guests  for  local  calls.   Each charge or individual hotel determines its own local call policy.\n\nDirect Dial Long Distance Calls: Direct Dial Long Distance Call are most common calls hotel guests place a long distance call determinates outsides the local calling area.  Once a long distance number is dialed it is distributed over phone company office, which roots the  call  to  whatever  long  distance  carrier  the  hotel  selected  to  handle  its  long  distance traffic Direct Dial Long Distance Calls are also typically required to as -1+‖ dial a ‗1‖ after accessing an outside line, then dial the area code and the telephone number.  They are attending to reach together; this string of numbers eliminates the need for telephone operator involvement.\n\nCalling Card Calls: Calling Card calls typically billed to a code number on a calling call issued  by  either  and  phone  company  by  a  private  billing  company  calling  cards  codes may be combination on the card holder's area code and telephone number plus a multi digit  personal  identification  number (PIN)  or  it  may  a  scrambled  set  of  numbers  and related to the card holders telephone.\n\nCollect  Calls: With  collect  calls  a  guest  first  dials  -O‖  and  the  full  telephone number. Then waits for a telephone company operator.  The guest informs the operator that the call is collect, to be billed to the receiving party.  The operator stays on the line and verifies that the receiving party accepts the charges most telephone companies pay a commission to the hotels for collect calls placed by guests.\n\nThird Party Calls: Third Party calls are similarly to collect calls except that the billed number is not the called number.  In most cases, the operator may require that someone at the  3rd  party  number  accepts  the charge  before  putting  the  call  through.   The  hotel's telephone company bills the 3rd party and the amount does not appear an guest's folio. The hotel may apply sur-charge or other fee for this service.\n\nPerson  To  Person  Calls: Person  to  Person  Calls  are  not  connected  unless  a  specific party name by the caller verify that he/she is on the line.

In addition the hotel may apply a sur-charge or other fee for their services.\n\nInternational  Calls: International  calls  can  be  direct  dial  or  placed  with  operator assistance.  To direct dial an international call, the guest typically dials an international access code and the telephone number similar to long distance calls.  The hotel bills the guests  for  direct  dialed  international  calls  while  the  phone  company  bills  the  guest  for calling card or credit card calls.\n\nToll Free Calls: Toll Free Calls can be direct dialed from a guest room as either local calls or long distance calls.  In either case the guest receives access to an outside line and dials -1+‖ the toll free access number (such as 800,888,877).  The hotel may apply a surcharge or other fee for this service.\n\n",

Front desk should take extra care to respond to the guest on a timely and accurate manner. The main focus of the front desk staff is to provide anticipatory service and to meet  or  exceed  the  guests  expectations.  This  will  encourage  the  guest  to  repeat  to  the hotel.\n\nSecurity  is  also  a  main  important  concern  during  occupancy  of  the  guest.  Issues  like protection of funds and valuables are among those. The front desk should also follow the hotel  standard  operating  procedure  for  handling  the  hotel  and  guest  keys,  property surveillance,  safe  deposit  boxes,  guests  personal  property,  and  emergencies  are  also important.\n\nA variety  of  charges  restaurant  charges,  telephone,  internet,  travel  desk  etc.  during  the occupancy stage affect guest and hotel account. Most of these charges will be posted to the guest account according to front office posting procedures. And also in most cases the Room charges is the single largest charge on the guest folio. Other front office financial tasks during the occupancy stage is to verify the charges posted to the guest account and checking guest accounts against the credit limit.\n\nDeparture: Guest services and guest accounting aspects of the guest cycle are completed during the cycle's fourth and final phase ie departure. At Departure the guest vacates the room, receives the accurate statement of the settled accounts, returns the room keys and leaves  the  hotel.  Once  the  guest  has  checked  out,  front  office  updates  the  rooms' availability status and notifies the housekeeping department. ( For hotels using Property management software the status of the room is updated automatically ). At this stage front office also collect the feedback of the guest experience in the hotels by handing over the guest feedback form.\n\nIn this unit we have tried to cover all the stages of guest cycle and guest accounting\n\n",

      "content": "The first interaction between the guest and the hotel begins when the guest enquires about the room availability and makes the room booking or reservation in the hotel. With the globalization and revolution in the field of travel and tourism, and with the increase in the disposable income of people, more and more people wants to travel to different places.\n\nThis increase in movement of tourist has increased the demand for tourist accommodation in  the  destination  and  to  have  safe  and  comfortable  stay  in  the  destination  guest  now prefer to make advance reservation in hotels. Hotel also these days relies mainly on the advance booking of room as it helps them to achieve high occupancy and to maximize their revenue.\n\nWhat is reservation? Reservation is the first stage of guest cycle, it can be defined as -Reservation is the activity of booking the room in advance for a prospective guest on his request for future, which may be from a few days to month in advance or can be defined as  blocking  a  particular  type  of  guest  room  (i.e.  single,  double  room.  etc),  for  the particular duration of time (i.e. number of days)and for a particular guest.\n\nReservation is one of the major sections of the front office department which plays the central  role  and  is  responsible  for  booking  the  hotel  room.  Reservation  section  is generally located back/behind of the reception as it does not come in direct contact with the guest. Reservation and reception to some extent are similar as they play the similar role of booking the room in the hotel. Therefore in l small hotels, Front office manager is the head of reservation section while in large hotels this section is headed by reservation manager who is assisted by reservation supervisor and assistants.\n\nThe main function of reservation is to receive the reservation request from the prospective guest, check the availability of rooms, to process the request and either to accept, wait list or deny the request, communicating it and then recording it i.e. maintaining or reservation records, files, charts, racks and computer records etc.\n\nImportance of Reservation: As mentioned earlier  the  role  of  reservations  is  not  only limited to making reservations but also to maintain records of the hotel occupancy which helps  the  management  in  planning  for  future  and  also  helps  in  estimating  man  power requirements. The same time efficiently executed reservation goes a long way in ensuring comfortable stay for the guest.  Thus reservation department is important for both hotel and the guest.\n\n",

However,  most  hoteliers  require  a  guest  guarantee  his  or  her  stay with a credit card number to ensure their intent of arrival and thus guarantee payment for product and services on the part of the guest and hotel.\n\nConfirmed  reservations,  is  the  prospective  guests  who  have  a  reservation  for\n\naccommodations that is kept until a specified time, represent the critical element in noshows. After that time (usually 4:00 P.M. or 6:00 P.M.), the hotel is under no obligation to hold the reservation. The front office manager must keep accurate records of no-shows in  this  group.  Various  types  of  travelers  with  confirmed  reservations  corporate,  group, leisure have different no-show rates. Walk-in numbers are often higher if the front office manager maintains good relations with the front office managers of nearby hotels, who may refer guests to the property when their own are fully booked. Sending guests who cannot be accommodated to nearby hotels is a win-win situation for guests and hotels. Guaranteed reservations, are the prospective guests who have made a contract with the hotel for a guest room, represent a less chances of no show because the guest provides a credit card number to hold a room reservation. According to the reports that the no-show rate  for  guaranteed  reservations  was  2  percent,  compared  to  10  percent  for  confirmed reservations.  The  front  office  manager  should  investigate  these  no-shows  to  determine their sources and plan accordingly. Stayovers are currently registered guests who wish to extend their stay beyond the time for which they made reservations.\n\nUnder stays are guests who arrive on time but decide to leave before their predicted date of  departure.  Leisure  travelers  may  find  their  tourist  attraction  less  interesting  than expected. Urgent business may require the corporate client to return to the office sooner than expected. Maintaining accurate records helps the front office manager predict under stays.\n\nWhen  these  occupancy  categories  are  tracked,  the  front  office  manager  can  more accurately  predict  occupancy.  The  front  office  manager  can  obtain  the  data  for  this formula by reviewing the property management system (PMS) reservation module, which lists the groups, corporate clients, and individual guests who have made reservations for a specific period. Also, the front office manager should check tourist activity in the area, business  events  planned  in  other  hotels,  and  other  local  special  events.  Permitted overbooking  rate  may  therefore  vary  from  hotel  to  hotel  -  since  hotels  with  a  high proportion  of  transient  trade  will  have  a  higher  no-show  proportion  than  a  long-stay resort, say. The rate may also vary from week to week, and should be clearly stated on the reservation  charts  for  any  given  period.  In  a  computerized  system,  the  software  will automatically  monitor  the  ratio  of  reservations  to  actual  arrivals,  and  adjust  the overbooking parameters for different periods, bookings and room types.\n\n",

All guests have to provide their name and nationality. In addition foreigners must provide their passport number, place of issue and next destination. Guests might register by way of recording their details in a register, on a registration card or by using a self check-in kiosk. Group guests and VIP's are often pre-registered by reception.

      "content": "Activities at the Reception desk: The Front desk receptionist checks the list of expected checkouts for the day and will confirm with the guest his date and time of  checkout.  Departure  notification  slips  are  prepared  to  inform  the  other departments  of  the  guest's  checkout.  In  a  manual  system  the  room  racks  are updated. The departure register is also updated.\n\nAccounting all transaction of guest bill: The front office cashier will coordinate with other departments like housekeeping for any laundry bills to be posted in guest accounts food and beverage department for any room service  bills/  restaurant  bills  etc.  Since  it  is  very  difficult  to  collect  the payment for unsettled bills after guest has checked out. Some time even guest may refuse to pay for the un-posted bills. So the cashier must ensure that all bills are posted in guest folio before bill settlement.\n\nTo Update Guest Folio By Cashier: The cashier must update guest folio by adding the last minute bills from other point of sale. To check for any late  checkout  charges  if  applicable.  For  example  if  the  hotel  checkout timing  is  12-noon  and  the  guest  depart  at  5.00  in  the  evening,  the  guest will be charged for late checkout. Cashier should make sure that all bills are posted before preparing final bill.\n\nTo Prepare Final Bill: Guest final bill is prepared on the basis of guest folios. Front office cashier must promptly enter the late checkout charges or  last  minute  bill  from  other  revenue  generating  departments.  Some common bills which are generally remain unposted in guest bill at the time of checkout are loss to the hotel revenue. To avoid any such situation of un posted  bills  in  guest  folio,  the  front  office  cashier  can  call  through telephone to other departments to send the bills to front office which can be posted without much delay or enquire with guest about their last minute bills.\n\nThe  other  department  also  should  cooperate  to  send  the  guest  bills  by deputing some staff to directly handover guest bills to front office cashier for smooth guest checkout to avoid any loss in revenue to hotel. It is very difficult  to  collect  money  from  guest  after  checkout  formalities  are completed and the guest left the hotel.\n\nTo  confirm  the  mode  of  payment  from  guest: The  method  of  bill settlement  is  generally  confirmed  with  the  guest  at  the  time  of  making room reservation or at the time of guest check in at the hotel. The guest will make appropriate entries in GUEST REGISTRATION CARD. So that it  is  easy for the cahier to perform checkout in professional manner. The mode of payment will differ from guest to guest in terms of guest profile and status. The guest can settle their bill by cash, credit card. Debit card, travel  agent  vouchers,  personal  cheque,  and  bill  to  company,  foreign currency, etc.\n\nThe above mentioned mode of bill settlement is generally followed in all luxury hotels, so that the cashier can prepare guest folio in advance. But it is  very  important  to  confirm  the  mode  of  bill  settlement  at  the  time  of guest check out also. Because even at the last minute the guest can change their mode of bill settlement, and the cashier should be able to handle such kind situations.\n\nReceiving Payment From Guest: After the final preparation of guest bill, it is given to guest for reviews. Once the guest is satisfied about their bills receive the payment as per the pre-decided mode of payment. Any posting error should be shown to the cashier for necessary action by guest. In case of cash settlement check the currency notes and hand over the balance to guest. PAID STAMP seal is put on top of the guest copy of bill. Put the bills in hotel envelope and hand over to guest.\n\nMarketing Activity Procedure During Check-Out: Since guest checkout is the final stage where guest come in contacts with front desk staff, the  hotel  staff  should  use  this  opportunity  for  marketing  efforts  for promoting hotel business.\n\nThe following marketing strategies may be followed:\n\nNotify  all  other  departments  about  guest  departure: The  front  desk through  departure  notification  slips  (DNS)  informs  all  the  departments about the departure of the guest to ensure smooth operations of the hotel, therefore the point of sale will not offer any credit facility to the guest who have  already  settled  their  bills  and  politely  ask  for  direct  payment.  The housekeeping  department  once  get  the  information  about  checkout performs following things\n\nTo ensure proper room management, both front office and housekeeping must coordinate and inform of the change in the room status\n\nUpdating Records after Guest Departure: Once the  guest  has  cleared his/her bills and checked out, the front office staff should update the hotel records especially the room status records for reselling of rooms. Different records which are updated after the guest check out are:\n\nRoom status record: As soon as the guest checkout the front desk updates the room status record, for this the front office removes the Name tag  slip  from  the  information  desk,  room  rack  so  that  the checkout rooms may be cleaned for next guest. If it is not followed the  room  will  be  vacant  and  dirty  and  it  cannot  be  given  to  any guest, which is loss to the hotel.\n\nGuest  History  Card: Generally  most  hotels  maintain  Guest history  Card,  which    is   a  file  which  containing  all  relevant personnel information about guest details like his previous arrival and departure dates, type of room and rate charged,  guest Name, age, Designation, Company, Marital status, Salary, Likes, dislikes, Interest in sports, Music, choice of Food, Any Special habits etc. Front office Department plays a very important role in maintaining and updating guest history time to time. Generally in all hotels this type  of  data  maintained  to  know  about  their  guest  preference  in terms of providing great customer service by all hotel staff.\n\nAll these details are collected at the front desk and entered in the guest  computer  data.  This  file  provide  information  about  guest financial status, spending pattern, mode of bill settlement, previous\n\nvisit date, any complaints and suggestions given by guest. Having such information helps the hotel to provide better guest service.\n\n",

In case if any guest insist on settling  bill  through  personal  cheque  than  front  desk  should  first  take  the  authorization from the lobby manager, On receiving authorization than the guest is asked to submit an letter  for  making payment by personal cheque the cashier before receiving the personal cheque should check the following details :\n\nDemand Draft: Demand draft in a written order form which is issued by the bank for the payment of money for the person on whose name the draft is issued. The bank authorises to make the payment once it is presented to the bank. Any person can obtain a demand draft by filling the necessary documents prescribed by bank and paying the draft amount and the bank will charge some commission amount for preparing demand draft.\n\nDebit Card: Debit card is also a mode of bill settlement generally accepted in all hotels. A debit card is a card made of plastic that allows the guest/customer to access their funds immediately, electronically. It enables the holder to withdraw money or to have the cost of  purchases  charged  directly  to  the  bank  account  without  paying  by  cash  or  writing  a cheque. While settling bills these cards are given to the cashier to swipe in the machine for deducting money directly from their saving account and the customer has to authorise the payment by pressing their PIN NO in the machine and the amount will be deducted from the customer account. In case of insufficient funds, the bank does not authorize the transaction and the guest is requested for an alternate mode of payment.\n\nCredit Settlement: A credit settlement is a settlement in which the hotel does not receive any payment on the day of departure of the guest but would receive it later.\n\nCredit Card/ Charge Card Payments: A credit card is a payment card generally  made  up  of  plastic  that  allows  the  owner  to  obtain  goods  and services on credit terms. It is a popular method of guest bill settlement for payment  as  Credit  cards  are  very  much  convenient  for  travellers:  they don't need to carry heavy cash or cheque book during their journey. As\n\ncredit cards are generally made up of plastic other name for credit card is plastic  money.  As  most  of  the  hotels  nowadays  use  electronic  machines linked  directly  to  the  bank,  card  details  are  collected  through  magnetic swiping  machine  for  appropriate  payments  and  mostly  hotels  accept  at least  one  or  two  major  credit  cards  for  example  Master  card,  American express,  Visa  card,  diners  club,  SBI  card,  ICICI,  etc.  A  charge  card  is similar to credit card is a plastic payment card that enables the holder to obtain  goods  and  services  without  the  requirement  to  pay  cash.  The account  settlement  is  sent  to  the  card  holder  every  month  and  must  be settled in full. Unlike the credit card the balance in the charge card account cannot be rolled over from one billing to the next. In addition for obtaining goods the charge card can be used to obtain cash few examples of charge card are American Express, Diners Club etc.\n\n",

As it is the responsibility of Front Office Cashier to record  all  transactions  that  affect  guest-ledger  and  non-guest  accounts  accurately  and completely  for  folio  creation,  the  necessary  information  is  taken  from  reservation  & registration  records,  for  pre-numbered  folios,  the  folio  number  is  entered  on  to  the registration card and vice-versa for cross-referencing.\n\nRecord keeping systems: Non- automated systems: Ensured through a series of columns  listing  individual  debit  and  credit  entries  accumulated  during  the occupancy stage after which and establishment of an ending outstanding balance is needed.\n\nSemi-automated systems: Under this very system, all guest transactions should be printed sequentially on a machine-posted folio. Later, the front office  clerk  needs  to  come  up  with  the  folio  outstanding  balance.  It  is extremely  important  here  to  mention  that,  under  this  very  system,  each account's previous balance shall be re-entered each time a transaction is posted to the folio.\n\nFully-automated systems: All  guest  charges are automatically posted to an electronic folio\n\nGuest charge privileges : The privilege  given to a guest to avail hotel facilities on credit basis.\n\nCredit monitoring: In order to monitor and control charge privileges, the front office  clerk  should  check  whether  the  total  net  purchases  are  less  than  the minimum of floor Limit (i.e.:  credit  card  company's  limit)  and  house  limit  (i.e.\n\nhotel's  limit).

Such  accounts  are  called  high  risk  or  high balance accounts.\n\nManagement  than  may  choose  to  request  additional  credit  authorization from the credit card company, or request a partial payment from the guest to reduce the accounts balance.\n\nThe front office may even deny charge purchase privileges to guest with high balance accounts until the situation is resolved.\n\n",

On the other hand, Under fully automated systems, tracking transactions  is  ensured  through  on-line  electronic  transfer  of  transactional  information from remote points of sale to the front office main frame terminal.\n\nA transaction can be one of several types:\n\nCash payment: In this transaction, Cash payments made by guests at the front desk are posted as credits to a guest or non guest account, and decrease the balance of the account, and cash vouchers are used as a transaction-supporting document.\n\nCharge  purchase: Charge  purchases  represent  deferred  payment  transactions.  In  a deferred payment transaction, the buyer receives goods and services but does not pay for them  at  the  time  they  are  provided  that  increase  the  outstanding  balance  of  a  folio account.  In  this  transaction  type,  front  office  clerks  shall  use  charge  vouchers  as  a transaction-supporting document.\n\nAccount  correction: Account  correction  is  used  to  resolve  a  posting  error  in  a  folio detected at the day the error is made (i.e. before the closing of the business day). In this transaction, front office  clerks shall use correction vouchers as a transaction-supporting document.\n\nAccount allowance: Account allowances occur because of two reasons:\n\nFor both reasons, front office clerks shall prepare an allowance voucher as a transaction supporting document.\n\nAccount Transfer: When any one guest offers to pay a charge for another guest, the charge must be transferred from one account to another account. The reduction in balance on the originating folio and the increase in balance on the destination folio will be supported by a transfer voucher.\n\nCash  advance/  Visitors  Paid  Out  (VPO): Cash  advances  differ  from  other transactions in that they reflect cash flow out of the hotel, either directly to or on behalf of a guest. Cash advance transactions are similar to debit transactions and increase a folio balance. Cash advances are supported by cash advance vouchers\n\nINTERNAL CONTROL: In the hotel industry, the main purpose of internal control is:\n\nThe keyword to internal control is auditing, which is the process of verifying front office accounting records for accuracy and completeness. Each Financial transaction produces paperwork which documents the nature and amount of the money of the transaction.\n\nFor example, the transaction that occurs when a guest charges a meal to his or her account folio  may  be  supported  by  the  restaurant's  guest  check,  cash  register  tape,  and  charge purchase voucher. The voucher is prepared and sent to the front office as notification of the transaction. A front desk agent, in turn, retrieves the guest's folio, posts the charge purchase  transaction,  and  files  the  folio  and  voucher.  Later  that  day,  the  night  auditor ensures  that  all  vouchers  have  been  properly  posted  to  accounts  discrepancies  may  be easier  to  resolve  if  complete  documentation  is  readily  available  to  substantiate  account entries.\n\nBelow are some forms that are of extreme importance to internally control, one of the most vital assets in the hotel (i.e. cash):\n\nFront  office  cash  sheet: The  front  office  is  responsible  for  a  variety  of  cash transaction,  which  may  affect  both  guest  and  non-guest  accounts  .proper  cash handling procedures and controls must be established, implemented, and enforced. The front office cash sheet records each cash receipt or disbursement in order to reconcile  cash  in  hand,  at  the  end  of  a  cashier's  shift,  with  the  documented transaction  that  occurred  during  the  same  shift.  It  provides  separate  columns  to record transactions affecting  guest  accounts,  non-guest  accounts(or  city  ledgers) and miscellaneous transactions\n\nCash  banks/  Imp  rest/  Cash  Float: A  second  set  of  front  office  accounting control procedure involves the use of cashier banks. Cash bank is an amount of cash assigned to a cashier so that he/ she can handle the various transactions that occur during the shift. At the beginning of each shift, all cashiers must sign their cash  banks  and  at  the  end  of  the  shift,  shall  deposit  all  cash,  checks,  and  other negotiable instruments in the general cashier's safe deposit box. Moreover, at the end  of  each  shift,  cashiers  should  watch  out  for  cash  discrepancies  (i.e.  any difference  between  front  office  cash  sheet  and  the  actual  amounts  in  their  cash drawers). Cash discrepancies might have the form of cash overages, shortages, or due backs. Lastly, cashiers might come up with the net cash receipt, which is:\n\nAmount of all cash, checks, and other negotiable instruments in cashier's drawer - amount of the initial cash bank + all paid outs\n\nAudit control: A  number of  audit  control  measures  are  used  to  ensure  that  the front office staff properly handles cash, guest accounts, and non-guest accounts. Therefore most of the hotels have internal audit as well as external annual audits performed by independent certified public accountants. This is done to ensure that all  accounts  are  being  properly handled by the staff concerned.  In both  cases,  a report is prepared and completed for management and ownership for their review.\n\nSETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS: One of the responsibilities of front office clerks is to settle  guest  accounts,  which  means  the  eventual  collection  of  payment  for  outstanding\n\n",

Thus Auditing  in  hotel  results  in  balanced  guest  &  non-guest  accounts,  accurate  account statements, credit monitoring and reports generation. It is generally done during night that is  why  it  is  called  as  night  auditing  and  person  responsible  for  doing  it  is  called  night auditor.\n\nDefinition: According  to  the  oxford's;  learner's  dictionary  audit  is  an  official examination of business and financial records to check that they are true and correct. The night  audit  is  a  daily  review  of  guest  accounts  and  non-guest  accounts  having  activity, against  revenue  centre  transaction  information  which  helps  guarantee  accuracy  in  front office  accounting.  It  is  the  process  of  auditing  where  the  night  auditor  reviews  all financial activities of the Hotel that has taken place in one day. A successful audit will result  in  balanced  accounts,  accurate  statements,  and  appropriate  credit  monitoring  and timely reports to management. Since hotels operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is important to review and verify the accuracy and completeness of its accounting records. Whatever the mode of audit the audit routine would remain relatively unchanged.  The audit is called a night audit because hotels generally perform it at night.\n\nWhy it is called as Night Audit? In most of the business An audit is generally carried out at the end of the every financial years and as hotel operates for 365 days following 24X7 pattern it become compulsory to safeguard the loss of revenue that may occur due to any error in the posting of charges in folios a daily auditing was required in the hotel and as in olden days, manual system was followed it was found night time was the most appropriate period for auditing due to very little business and movement during the night i.e. traffic of guest was less in the night and besides that all the posting will be done till the night so night was the most suitable time to review and check all the posting done throughout the day, therefore auditing was done in night and thereby it is called as night auditing.\n\nIt  is  called Night Audit because it is performed at Night. In olden days, manual system was followed and For a hotel business, the finance management starts at the front office. Accurate  posting  of  transactions  on  the  guest  folios  start  at  the  front  office,  which  is further  carried  to  the  back-office  accounting  department.  The  guest  accounts  are counterchecked  on  a  daily  basis  during  auditing.  Experts  recommend  the  hotel management team to go through the night audit reports daily to get an insight of the hotel occupancy and finances.\n\nThe  Need  for  Night  Audit: The  objective  of  night  audit  is  to  evaluate  the  hotel's financial activities. Night audit not only reviews guest accounts by checking credits and debits but also tracks the credit limits of the guests and tallies projected and actual sales from various departments. Night audit reviews daily cash flow into and out of the hotel's account.  Night  audit  has  a  large  significance  in  hotel  business  operations.

In  hotels  this  time  is  usually  the  hours  at  which  the  least  number  of transactions would occur and which is in the night shift that is why the auditing in hotel is done during night.\n\nComplete  outstanding  postings  and  verifying  transactions: Night  auditor ensures proper posting of all transactions affecting non-guest and guest accounts. Transactions are supposed to be posted to accounts as they are received and he has to  ensure  that  all  vouchers  are  posted.  Further  he  has  to  verify  (even  in computerized  system)  the  postings.  This  he  does  by  matching  reports  from interfaces with reports from Front Office system in a computerized environment.\n\nReconciling  Transactions: The  next  step  is  there  reconciliation  of  the  entire financial  transaction  taken  place  throughout  the  day  with  the  original  source documents/vouchers.  There reconciliation is done in the following sections:\n\nReconciling  Room  Status  Discrepancies:  Room  status  discrepancies  must  be resolved in a timely manner. Such errors can lead to lost revenue and omissions in postings. The front office must keep room status current and accurate to monitor the  number  of  rooms  available  for  sale.

Therefore night auditor should be very careful before posting to avoid charging a guest for no-show charges when not applicable.\n\nPost room rate and tax: The posting of room rates and tax to all guest folios is typically  done  at  the  end  of  day.  Direct  posting  of  these  to  the  electronic  room folios in a computerized system is one of the greatest advantages of a PMS. After such posting, a Room Rate and Tax Report may be made sfor the management.\n\nPreparing reports: The next step is that auditor is responsible for preparation of various  reports  for  managerial  use  which  helps  them  manage  entire  view  the profitability of the hotel operations and to plan for future. In manual system this is one of the typical task but in fully automated hotel these reports are automatically prepared by the system. The reports prepared are\n\nHigh Balance Report: The High Balance Report identifies guests who are approaching  an  account  credit  limit.  This  is  a  detailed  report  about  the guests  either  resident  guest  or  city  account  who  are  approaching  or exceeded the credit limit set by  the hotel management. the night auditor checks all the accounts against the credit limit or the house limits set by the hotel and a high balance report is prepared in case any guest account reaches or crosses the house limit.\n\nOccupancy  reports: The  night  auditor  also  generates  the  following occupancy reports:\n\nOccupancy Percentage: This is the ratio of the number of rooms sold to the total saleable rooms. It helps in determining the level of revenue that will be generated by the hotel and is indicator of the performance of the hotel.\n\n𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝒙 𝟏𝟎𝟎\n\n𝑶𝒄𝒄𝒖𝒑𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒚 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 = 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒏𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒔𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔\n\nHouse Count : The house count is the total number of resident guests present in the  hotel  ie  the  total  number  of  rooms  sold.

      "content": "There are four stages of guest cycle followed by account settlement which is taken care by  account  department  in  coordination  with  front  office  as  the  maximum  revenue  is generated from front office. The four stages of guest cycle are: pre arrival, arrival, stay and departure. each guest coming to the hotel has to go through the same procedure as they proceed from reservation to arrival and allotment of rooms to their stay in the hotel, to the settlement of bill and departure from the hotel.\n\nPre arrival is the stage where guest books the room for himself in advance also called as reservation, as more and more people are travelling these days so to have comfortable and secure stay guest now pre book their room before visiting the destination, this helps the hotel in planning for future in terms of revenue, occupancy and man power requirement. Hotels can receive reservation request from different modes- verbal and oral and through different sources like the travel agencies, direct guest, corporate, but now days with the advancement of technology the most accepted source of reservation is CRS &GDS. the reservation made by the guest can be tentative, confirmed or waitlisted. In either of the type  of  reservation  request  received  the  standard  procedure  of  responding  is  to  first\n\nreceive  the  guest  reservation  inquires,  then  checking  the  room  availability  and  then accepting or denying the request.\n\nGenerally hotels do the overbooking so as to reduce the losses caused due to no shows, under stays etc, overbooking means booking more rooms than available in hotel. These stage of guest cycle is arrival- in which the registration activities are carried out to check in the guest, registration is mandatory for all the hotels to keep the details or records of all the guest staying in the hotel i.e. it act as a valid contract between hotel and the guest, the activities that are carried out just before the arrival of the guest for the efficient, smooth and  speedy  check  in  of  the  guest  is  known  as  preregistration,  To  maintain  registration records hotel either uses bound book , loose leaf, or Guest registration card GRC. The registration  process  involves  the  identification  of  guest  status,  preparing  registration records, room and rate assignments, establishing mode of settlement and finally allotting the room and issuing the keys there by completing the check in procedure.\n\nThe third stage of guest cycle is the stay- in this the major role is played by F& B Service and housekeeping department in terms of room service and room cleaning for the guest, front  office  is  only  concerned  with  providing  guest  services  like  handling  mails  and messages in absence of the guest, proving wakeup call on the request of the guest, paging the guest inside the premises of the hotel, providing safety deposit lockers if required by the guest, All these services contribute to guest satisfaction which ensures repeat business and positive mouth publicity by the guest . The fourth and the last stage of guest cycle is the departure stage and settlement of guest accounts. An efficient, speedy and error free billing leads to leaving a lasting impression in the minds of the guest. As the guest are generally in hurry at the time of checkout, so the departure procedure should be simple and short ,new methods of checkout like Express check out and self check out are also being used now days to reduce the long queue at the cashier counter. The modes of bill settlement- cash and credit- are also explained in detail.\n\nThe timely and accurate posting of guest's financial transactions is very important for the successful running of the business it helps the hotel to make accurate bills and receive payment from the guest thereby preventing the loss of revenue and leads to higher guest satisfaction. The front office cashier record the financial transactions properly in different types  of  accounts,  vouchers  and  folios  so  as  to  ensure  error  free  billing.  finally  in  the night the night auditor rechecks all the financial transactions done throughout the day at the front office as well as at other point of sales. as hotel is operational 365x24x7 so it is essential to bring to an end the day's business so at the time of auditing business is close for the day and new day is establish , this is generally done in the night (after midnight) when the business is slow. The daily audit is carried out in hotel at night to check and verify the accuracy and completeness of the financial transactions between the hotel and its guest so that revenue for the day can be known.\n\n",

In  order  to  get  huge  success  in  business  area,  an  organization  must  plan  its financial  activities  well  in  advance.  It  must  assess  its  income  and  expenditures  using historical data of activities in the past and predict future trends. The budget as explained by numerous experts is not just a financial plan that sets forth cost and revenue goals but it is an  effective  tool  for  planning  for  future,  for  controlling,  synchronization, communication, enthusiasm and performance measurement. In the organisation one of the most  important  aspects  of  management  is  control.  The  control  is  derived  from  two categories as:\n\nTraditional  approach -  includes  break  even  analysis,  standard  costing,  rate analysis, internal audit, budgets etc.\n\nModern  control  approach -  includes  PERT  (programme  evaluation  review technique),CPM (critical path method) or  time network an analysis or (operation research)though all these methods are being used, still budgeting remains one of the most important techniques of control.\n\nWith reference to  hotels  an  annual  budget  is  a  profit  plan  which  addresses  all  revenue sources and expanses items, Hotels prepare annual budgets to help the management team\n\noperate  the  hotel  more  efficiently.

Now since the future is indefinite so whatever base we might have taken for future may occur or may not occur  completely  or  partially  as  per  our  planning,  and  hence  when  it  comes  to  actual stage,  the  actual  figures  may  match  -  may  be  more  or  may  be  less  than  the  projected figures.  Like  for  eg  we  have  budgeted  a  sale  of  Rs1,00,00,000over  a  period  of  three months which meansapproxRs33,33,333 shall be earned every month by the hotel, now at the  end  of  every  month  we  are  required  to  check  whether  we  are  able  to  achieve  the targeted figure or not, and, if in actual also we are meeting the target than our forecasted targeted  sale  was  right  but  if  there  is  lot  of  difference  which  may  be  both  positive  or negative then it means our initial planning was wrong. Such variances have to be studied and analyzed immediately and corrective action should be taken which means based on new circumstances, new targeted figures are to be calculated.

This  is  only possible  when  operational  results  are  reviewed  from  time  to  time.  Thereby  refining  of budget  is  very  important  activity  it  protects  the  establishment  from  heavy  losses.  The refining of the budget must be done by the same person who has initially prepared the budget, but he must be furnished with facts and figures.\n\n",

Wheldon,  -By budgetary control, every items of actual cost is so controlled by vigilant supervision as to make it conform, as nearly as possible, to the predetermined standards. It has resulted in the  elimination  of  waste  and  excess  costs  in  every  suitable  instance  where  budgetary control has been properly instituted.‖ According to John Blocker, -Budgetary control is planned to assist the management the allocation of responsibilities and authority, to aid in making estimates and plans for future, to assist in analysis of various between estimated and  actual  results  and  to  develop  basis  of  measurement  or  standards  with  which  to evaluate the efficiency of operations.‖\n\nIn other words, the budgetary control device in the organisation encompasses practically the whole range of management activities right from planning and policy formulation to the final function of control over various activities of the manufacturing enterprise.\n\nBudgetary control is a useful management control device. As the name suggests is the financial  control  through  budgets  which  means  fixing  the  responsibility  for  budgeted result to the managers concerned for eg fixing responsibility on front office manager for promoting results and meeting the targeted and budgeted figures of sales, cost and staff etc.  It  act  as  a  control  technique  as  it  provides  a  standard  for  evaluation  of  actual performance. Hence when we speak about budgetary control we mean the responsibilities that we assign to manager's usually expressed in terms of items such as sales target, profit margins, etc hence budgetary control is the technique to check what is being done and comparing  actual  result  with  the  standard  budgeted  data  in  order  to  approve accomplishments  or  to  remedy  differences  by  either  adjusting  the  budget  estimates  or correcting  the  cause  of  differences  where  there  is  budgetary  control  in  the  operation, current  operating  result  are  continually  viewed  and  analyzed  on  weekly,  monthly  or quarterly  basis  or  any  other  period  depending  upon  the  profile  of  the  policy  of  the business. The most important aspect of budgetary control is the planning which goes into the making of budget and its effectiveness in the control of hotel operation.\n\nHow budgetary control is applied: Budgetary control is required to achieve the goals and  objectives  of  the  hotel.  For  this  it  is  important  to  follow  the  course  of  action  that would help to achieve the targeted budget. when the manager find that there is deviations in actual from the budgeted targets he must immediately find the cause for it and quickly decide and implement the corrective action to set those deviations right.\n\nObjectives of Budgetary Control: The main purpose of budgetary control is to enable the management to conduct the business in the most efficient manner in the organisation.

      "content": "Yield Management is becoming part of the standard operating procedure(SOP) for many hotels  with  property-Management  systems  (PMS)  being  used  in  hotel  industry. Appropriately designed to meet the hotels need, yield management systems generally tries to increase revenue and do much of the guesswork out of rooms-management decisions.\n\nTHE CONCEPT OF YIELD MANAGEMENT: The airline industry is considered as the  birthplace  of  yield  management.  After  deregulation  in  the  late1970s,  airline competition  increased,  and  the  airlines  tried  to  operate  their  planes  as  efficiently  as possible. As they knew their product is perishable in nature eg airplane seat if not sold on a  particular  day  cannot  be  stored  for  future  use  ie  revenue  lost  from  that  seat  is  lost forever so to avoid losses and to maximize revenue- Yield management was one of the methods developed as a way of increasing competitive advantage and increasing revenue. In airlines, yield management is concerned with selling the right seat to the right customer at the right price so as to maximize yield.\n\nThe airline and hotel industries have several characteristics in common that make them ideal candidates for yield-management systems, the most important one is that both their product or services are perishable ie Each has a fixed number of products (hotel rooms and airline seats) that, if not sold on a certain day or flight, cannot be resold eg a guest room if not sold on particular day cannot be stored for future use- revenue lost for the day is  lost  forever.  Besides  that  Both  have  relatively  fixed  capacities.  Once  an  airplane  has been purchased or a hotel has been built, it is rather difficult and expensive to increase capacity. The idea, then, is to use the available capacity in the best (most profitable) way possible. Moreover Airlines and hotels sell to market segments that have distinct needs in product and service level. Each has demand periods (holidays, weekdays, and weekends in hotels; holidays, weekdays, and time of day for airlines) that place the provider in a favorable position. Airlines and hotels have various rates from which guests can choose. Reservations  allow  managers  to  use  yield  management.  By  using  computers  to  track  a database of products (hotel rooms and airline seats) and to process reservations, managers have the ability to look at a sales horizon of 45 to 90 days and to set price and reservation policies that will allow a prediction of profitability.\n\nThereby  from  above  discussion  it  is  clear  that  when  any  organisation  or  industry  is operating with a relatively fixed capacity, when demand can be segmented into clearly identified  partitions,  when  inventory  is  perishable,  when  the  product  is  sold  well  in advance, when demand fluctuates substantially, and when marginal sales costs are low but marginal production costs are high- Yield-management techniques are appropriate to use to get maximum revenue.\n\n",

Yield management is the source for the concepts that underlie revenue management.\n\nBasically, yield management is the process of allocating the right type of capacity to the right kind of customer at the right price so as to maximize revenue or yield. In the case of hotels, yield management is concerned with the number of rooms that should be sold at various  rate  levels.  The  manager  would  prefer  to  sell  all  rooms  at  the  highest  rate possible, but since this rarely is possible, following this policy may lead to empty rooms and  lost  revenue.  Conversely,  if  a  hotel  fills  its  rooms  with  low-price  customers,  the revenue that  could  have been obtained  from higher rates will be lost. The objective of yield management, then, is to define what should be done, so as to get maximum revenue in all possible situations. How many rooms should be allocated to and protected for each market segment over time?\n\nYield Management also is not only a Technique used to Maximize Room Revenues but also  act  as  an  evaluative  Tool  that  allows  the  Front  Office  Manager  to  use  Potential Revenue as the Standard against which Actual Revenue can be Compared.\n\n",

Capacity management balances the risk of overselling guestrooms against the  potential  loss  of  revenue  arising  from  spoilage  because  rooms  going unoccupied after reservations were closed out.\n\nOther forms of capacity management include determining how many walk-ins to accept  on  the  day  of  arrival  based  on  expected  cancellations  and  no-shows. Capacity  management  usually  varies  with  room  type.  That  is,  it  might  be economically  advantageous  to  overbook  more  in  lower-priced  rooms,  because upgrading to higher-priced rooms is an acceptable solution to an oversell problem.

In  sophisticated  computerized  yield  management  systems, capacity  management  may  also  be  influenced  by  the  availability  of  rooms  at neighboring hotels or competing properties.\n\nDiscount  Allocation: Discounting  involves  restricting  the  time  period  and product mix (rooms available at reduced prices (prices below rack rate). For each discounted room type, reservations are requested at various available rates, each set below rack rate. The theory is that the sale of a perishable item (the guestroom) at  a  reduced  price  is  often  better  than  no  sale  at  all.  The  primary  objective  of discount allocation is to protect enough remaining rooms at a higher rate to satisfy the projected demand for rooms at that rate; while at the same time filling rooms that would otherwise have remained unsold. This process is repeated for each rate level  from  rack  rate  on  down.  Implementing  such  a  scheme  requires  a  reliable mechanism for demand forecasting.\n\nA second objective of limiting discounts by room type is to encourage upselling. This technique requires a sound estimate of price elasticity and / or the probability of upgrading. (Elasticity refers to the relationship between price and demand.) If a small  increase  in  price  causes  drop  in  demand  the  market  is  said  to  be  elastic while, if small increase in price causes no effect on demand, the market is said to be inelastic produces little or no effect on demand.\n\nDuration  Control: Duration  control  places  time  constraints  on  accepting reservations  in  order  to  protect  sufficient  space  for  multi-day  requests (representing higher levels of revenue). This means that, under yield management, a reservation for a one night stay may be rejected, even though space is available.\n\n",

      "title": "4.3.6  Elements of Yield Management",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The following elements must be included in the development of a successful revenue or hotel yield management strategy:\n\nGroup  Room  Sales  and  its  effect  on  Hotel  Yield: A  group  sale  provides  the  bulk booking and thereby forms the majority of the room revenue and is very important for hotel yield. It is common for the hotels to receive group reservations for group sales from three months to two years in advance of arrival. Therefore understanding group booking trends  and  requirements  is  very  essential  for  the  success  of  revenue  management.  To understand the impact of group sales on overall room revenue, the hotel should collect as much group profile information as possible, including:\n\nGroup booking data It is a common practice that Groups tend to block 5-10% percent more rooms than they actually require. Thus FOM analyze and checks that If a group has a previous business profile with the hotel than on the basis of their past records, he can often adjust the block on the basis of group's booking history. The hotel's deletion of unnecessary group rooms from a group block is called the ‗wash  factor'.  However  management  must  be  very  much  careful  in  estimating how many rooms to be ‗washed' or deleted from the block as if a group block is reduced by too many rooms, the hotel may find itself overbooked and unable to give rooms to all the members of the group and it will effect hotel yield badly.\n\nGroup booking pace The rate at which group business is being booked is called group  booking  pace.  The  rate  at  which  initial  agreement  between  the  group organizers and hotel takes place, over a period of time.\n\nAnticipated group business - Hotels generally watches out for repetitive group patterns and act accordingly in order to forecast the pressure on the market, and thereby  adjusting  their  selling  strategies  many  national,  regional  and  state associations  as  well  as  some  corporate,  have  policies  regarding  the  locations  of annual meeting.\n\nGroup  booking  lead  time -  A  measurement  of  how  far  in  advance  group bookings  are  made  ie  lead  time  is  the  gap  between  the  date  of  booking  and expected date of arrival. The hotel should fix the lead time for group booking the lead time together with the pace of booking is important in deciding how much additional group business should be accepted. If the current booking pace is lower than  expected  a  lower  rate  to  stimulate  the  business  should  be  offered  to  get increased occupancy and if demand is strong an group booking pace is ahead of the trends no discounts should be offered.\n\nDisplacement of transient business -The process of Displacement means when the hotel decides to accept the group business even if they have to turn away the transient guest, although the transient guest are ready to pay higher room rates is the  acceptance  of  group  bookings  instead  of  transient  guests.  Since  transient guests or FITs pay higher room rates than group business, the reservations team should consult its forecast staff whether or not to accept group business for better hotel  yield.  As  well  as  there  is  risk  of  bad  reputation,  so  the  Front  Office Management  should  monitor  and  ensure  that  by  transient  displacement  more revenue generation and higher occupancy should be achieved by the hotel, and to avoid  the  situation  that  transient  guest  who  will  not  return  back  to  the  hotel because  of  their  initial  treatment,  the  hotel  must  take  care  of    and  by accommodating them in some other hotel of the same standards and should be in constant touch with the guests as to give them the feeling that hotel really cares for them.\n\nTransient or FIT room sales and its effect on yield: Transient rooms are the rooms sold to  free  individual  travelers  (FIT)  or  non  group  travelers.  Transient  business  is  usually booked near to their date of arrival than group business who books their rooms one to three months in advance; transient may book their room only one to three weeks before arrival. Thus in order to maximize room revenues, front office managers may:\n\nFood and Beverage activity and Hotel Yield: Food and beverage activities in particular catering  for  functions  and  receptions  etc  generate  revenue  for  hotel  independently  they can  have  an  effect  on  room  revenue.  For  example,  if  a  banquet  with  no  guestroom requirements is occupying the hotel's banquet hall, while a group needing 50 guestrooms and a banquet hall may have to be turned away. Therefore a group needing both catering and  guestrooms  is  more  profitable.  Thus  the  hotel  staff  should  be  encouraged  to  book such groups who need both accommodation as well as fooding and banquet hall and other function facilities etc from the hotel only (such as marriage parties or corporate having residential  conference)  so  as  to  earn  revenue  from  both  rooms  and  food  and  beverage also.  Special  packages  can  be  made  and  offered  to  the  guest  for  this  a  effective communication and coordination between departments is necessary to maximize revenue from all revenue centers in the hotel.\n\nLocal and Area-Wide activities and Hotel Yield: Local  and  area  wide  activities  like conventions, meetings etc, have a great effect on the revenue management strategies of the hotel. The front office manager and sales or marketing division should be aware of such activities taking place in the destination and the demand for guestrooms created by them in the area. The room rates should be offered according to the demand to take full advantage of the opportunity. Even when a Hotel is not in the immediate vicinity of a Convention, Transient  Guests  and  Smaller  Groups  displaced  by  the  Convention  as  one individual hotel may not be able to accommodate all the guest thereby displacing them, the FOM should be ready to cash such situations by inviting them in their hotel may be referred to the Hotel (as an Overflow Facility) and this will have a tremendous impact on Hotel's Revenue\n\nSpecial  Events  and  Hotel  Yield: Special  events  such  as  concerts,  festivals  and  sports events  held  in  or  near  the  hotel  are  also  very  important  for  the  hotels  yield.  The  front office manager should be able to take advantage of these events by controlling discount ie hotels  might  decide  to  benefit  from  high  demand  by  restricting  room  rate  discounts  or requiring a minimum length of stay.\n\n",

For  this  FOM  or  management  must  rely  on their previous experience with the groups to develop the effective management policies. Keeping the focus on the total revenue it is good to sell blocks of guest rooms to groups because they not only give money through rooms but also provide revenue through the purchase  of  meeting  place,  food  and  beverage  services  and  other  hospitality  products from the hotel. This tactic usually requires restricting access of local patrons to functions meeting and public spaces if these spaces are booked by local patrons potentially more profitable for groups needing such space may be forced to go elsewhere. Another tactics for  handling  group  business  during  high  demand  periods  is  to  attempt  to  move  price sensitive groups to low demand days. In other words if the hotel forecast is high demand for a time when a price sensitive group has already booked space, management may try to reschedule the group's business to a period of lower demand. This tactic which is often easier said than done allow the hotel to replace the lower room rate group with a group willing to pay higher rates.\n\nPotential  Low  Demand  Techniques: The  strategy  for  transient  and  group  business during low demand period:\n\n",

It is a broad plan of action prepared to achieve the policy objectives set by the management for the coming year. It can be called as the blueprint of how the revenue generated will be utilized by the organisation. There are  different  types  of  budget  like  fixed  budget,  flexible  budget,  departmental  budget, master budget etc but  the  two  main  budget  prepared  by  front  office  are  capital  budget which include expenditure for those items which have lifespan of more than one year eg furniture and fixtures of front office software of front office etc whereas operating budget includes the expenditure required for daily operation of the organization eg labour cost etc.  Besides  that  the  most  important  function  of  FOM  in  budget  is  to  forecast  room revenue  and  estimating  related  expenses  as  most  expanses  of  front  office  are  direct  in\n\nnature,  and  historical  data  can  be  analyzed  to  calculate  the  room  revenue  that  each expense  item  may  represent.  The  management  of  hotel  uses  budgetary  control  for controlling cost and maximizing profit as it helps in continuous comparison of actual with budgeted figures so that timely action can be taken in case of deviation.\n\nHere in this unit we studied yield and the various techniques that are used to maximize revenue  generation  in  the  hospitality  industry.  Yield  is  the  ratio  of  actual  revenue generated  to  potential  revenue.  These  techniques  are  applicable  to  all  the  perishable products  and  services  .yield  management  or  revenue  management  is  a  pricing  strategy based on demand and supply as when demand increases more than supply, the prices are raised and when supply increases than demand, prices are reduced or lowered to attract more business. The yield management tools are capacity management, discount allocation and duration control. In a nutshell, yield management can be defined as selling a product or service to the right customer, at the right time, and at the right price so as to maximize revenue.\n\n",

In  Front  office  it  is  given  more  importance  as  it  is  the  major  revenue producing  department  and  the  activities  of  other  departments  are  dependent  on  their activities,  so  the  front  office  manager  (FOM)  has  to  pay  more  time  and  efforts  in identification  of  data  which  can  be  useful  for  planning  in  front  office  operations.  The process of front office management can be divided into specific management functions:\n\nPlanning : It is one of the most important management functions as if the planning is  properly  done  it  will  lead  to  the  achievement  of  the  organizational  goals therefore  at  the  planning  stage,  the  front  office  manager  tries  to  determine  the department's goals both short term and long term and later, he will use these goals as a guide for planning more specific and measurable objectives. Finally, the front office manager will decide the strategies and tactics to achieve these objectives.\n\nOrganizing :  The front office manager shall organize the work in such a manner that work is so divided among the staff keeping in mind the planned goal as the benchmarks. While doing so, he ensures that the work shall be distributed fairly among the employees and should be completed in a timely manner.\n\nCoordinating :  It  involves bringing together and using the available resources to attain planned goals. The FO manager must be able to coordinates efforts of the employees so that they can perform their work more efficiently and effectively. Effective  coordination  is  not  only  required  among  the  employees  of  the department but also coordination is required with other departments for eg front office coordinating with housekeeping for selling the room so FOM should ensure effective  coordination  within  and  with  other  departments  so  as  to  achieve organizational goal.\n\nStaffing :  It  involves  recruitment  and  selection  of  the  candidates  those  who  best qualifies  for  positions,  and  scheduling  employees.  FO  manger  should  develop staffing  guidelines  which  are  based  on  formulas  for  calculating  the  number  of employees required to meet guest and operational requirements.\n\nLeading : It  involves  guiding,  motivating,  training,  disciplining,  overseeing  and setting an example for the front office employees.\n\nControlling :  It  involves  setting  the  standards  or  benchmarks,  communicating these  standards  to  employees,  measuring  the  actual  results  of  operations, comparing the measured results with the actual and finally taking the corrective actions.\n\nEvaluating :  It  involves  identifying  the  extent  to  which  planned  goals  are achieved.  Than reviewing it and, when necessary, revising or helping to revise front office goals.\n\n",

As  price  is  one  of  the  major  guest  concerns  for  selecting  a particular hotel for stay. Guests with budget constraints may request a room for the lowest price; this is their primary concern, while Room location, floor plan, room arrangements, ancillary equipment, and immediate occupancy play very lesser roles in their choice of room selection. Room price is not only the concern for the guest but also for the hotel. The  pricing  should  be  such  that  it  covers  the  cost  of  production  and  overheads,  and include  a  fair  amount  of  profit,  so  that  the  hotel  business  remains  sustainable  and profitable.  As the room are the major source of revenue for hotel so a competitive and good  room  rent  is  essential  for  running  a  successful  hospitality  business.  As  if  the management fixes low room rates, the hotel operations might not be economical while if they are too high, the guest may not patronize the property.\n\nAs it is very clear from above point of view that price of the room is one of the major elements so the manager should be very careful in terms of tariff fixation (The term tariff means the rate which when applied to rooms of a hotel it means room rate).Hotel tariff or room  rate  fixation  is  a  difficult  task  as  the  room  rates  are  both  quantifiable  and qualifiable. Therefore the basis of charging the room rates varies from hotels to hotels.\n\n",

The concept is based on an  idea  of  what  the  ultimate  customer  is  ready  to  pay  i.e.  what  he  is  willing  to  pay becomes the starting point. In that case, the hotel works backwards as it first makes an accommodation product available at a price that a guest is willing to pay, and then it tries to work on the cost in such a manner that a hotel receives a reasonable rate of return on that manner.\n\nThis approach can also be called as common sense approach. As management surveys the market and check other comparable hotels in the market and sees what they are charging for the same product. The approach behind this concept is that the hotel can charge only what the market willing to accept, and this is usually controlled by the competition.\n\nThere  are  many  problems  in  this  approach,  firstly  in  case  of  new  property,  the construction and other cost will be more in the beginning than those of the competitors thus  the  hotel  cannot  be  as  profitable  as  the  competitors  initially.  Second,  with  the property being new and having newer amenities, the value of property to guests can be more than the competitors. The market condition approach is fully a marketing approach that allows the local market to determine the rate. The market approach is further divided into:\n\n",

Cost oriented pricing is popular as it requires internal information which can be calculated easily and besides that they can justify the prices as it took into consideration cost plus a mark up for profit.\n\nThe following are the two widely used cost based pricing techniques:\n\nThe Rule of Thumb: This is one of the traditional methods of tariff fixation used in the hotel for fixing the price of the room, according to this approach the room rate is fixed at Rs. 1 for each Rs. 1000 which is been spent on the construction and furnishing of the room assuming 70 % occupancy for the year. This is also called as cost rate formula.\n\nFor example, assume that the average construction and furnishing cost of a hotel room is Rs. 50,00,000/- the average rack rate of hotel room in this hotel using thumb rule will be Rs. 5000, as illustrated below.\n\n1000              :       1\n\n50, 00,000    :      5000\n\nThus in this approach only the cost incurred at the time of starting the operation is only considered and if we try to know the room rent after 20 years of its operation the rate would come the same as (Rs1 For Rs 1000) though the cost of operations would have increased manifold. This is one of the major drawback of this approach and some other draw backs are:\n\n",

Using  the  bottom-up approach,  you  begins  with  calculating  the  desired  net  income  which  is  based  on  the owner's desired return on investment (ROI) and the income statement by adding back estimated taxes, non-operating expenses, and undistributed operating expenses and then subtracting out estimated operated departments income (excluding rooms). This will lead to the result which will be the estimated operated department income for rooms. Next, you  can  separate  the  estimated  operated  department  income  for  rooms  into  rooms revenue  and  rooms  expenses.    Once  rooms  expenses  are  subtracted  than  only,  rooms revenue will remain. This revenue can then be again divided into number of rooms to be sold and, finally, ADR. The resulting ADR is the average price that should be charged for your rooms in order to achieve the owner's desired net income (ROI).\n\nSTEPS: The  following  steps  are  involved  in  calculating  the  room  rent  according  to Hubbart formula :\n\nStep  1 :  Calculate  the  total  investment  including  the  owner's  capital  and  loans. Once total investment is known, calculate hotel's desired profit by multiplying the desired rate of return (ROI)  by the owner's investment.\n\nStep  2 : Calculate  the  total  expanses  like  operating  expenses,  overhead, depreciation  of  fixed  assets,  interest  paid,  taxes  sand  insurances  etc  that  will happen during hotel operations.\n\n",

      "content": "Room rates are of two types:\n\nRack Rate: It refers to the actual or normal room rates of the hotel room. Hotel generally fixes a standard rate for each of the category of rooms offered to guests. In olden days, a wooden rack or rate board was placed near the room rack in the lobby or at the reception, hence the name is placed rack rate. This is the rate which is published on the tariff card of the hotel and is without any discount is known as the Rack rate. In general, rack rate may be termed as the MRP of a hotel room.\n\nDiscounted Rate: To attract  and  motivate  the  guest  to  provide  regular  business  to  the hotel and also to compete in the market, hotels offer different types of discounted room tariff.  Discounted  tariff  are  always  lower  than  the  rack  rate.  Sometimes  hotels  offer discounts to guest to please him for a  courtesy  as it is  expected that  the  guest  may  be sending lot of business to the hotel in future. Some of these discounted rates are given as below:\n\nCorporate Rate : To attract the corporate market segment, corporate discount on the rates are offered to companies and corporate houses which is usually 10-15% discount on the rack rate  are  offered.  Now  a  day's  various  MNCs  organize  residential  conferences  and training programs at different destinations away from their work places and hotels wants to cash these opportunities so they tries to lure the corporate houses   by offering them different discounted rates.\n\nGenerally corporate rate is of two types:\n\nSeasonal Rate : Seasonal and resort hotels usually have fluctuating demand ie they have a very clear peak season, mid season / shoulder period and off season depending upon their locality and interest of guest Destinations like hill stations, beaches and resorts etc receive heavy traffic during particular period of the year: the rest of the year is the lean period in terms tourism. Therefore when the tourist traffic is more at a particular place is known as peak  season  hotels  do  not  offer  any  discount  and      they  charge  rack  rate  during  peak season  and  sometimes  even  more  than  the  rack  rate  known  as  seasonal  rates,  and  as tourist traffic drops down, to attract the tourist hotels offer discounted rates to the guest known  as  off  season  rates  Hotels  in  these  locations  mention  their  seasonal  and  off seasonal rates clearly on the traffic card rates.\n\nAdvance Purchase Rate: The concept is more popular in the airline industry, and is a relatively new concept in the hospitality industry. It gives heavy discount on room rates when room booking are done in advance. The rate of discount depends upon the advance time period and the number of rooms available at the time of booking ie a hotel may give discount  for  a  room  that  is  booked  in  advance  as  compared  to  a  room  that  is  booked fifteen day in advance, The advance booking of rooms ensure the revenue in future and thereby helps in future planning and revenue management\n\nWeek Day /Weekend Rate : Some hotels have a fluctuation in their occupancy level with regard to the days of the week .The demand for rooms in such hotels may be more on certain days in a week like: Business hotels have to face low occupancy on weekends as most  of  the  establishments  and  offices  are  closed  on  weekends,  therefore  to  attract business  on  weekend,  special  discounted  rates  are  offered  by  these  hotels  to  the  guest while. Resorts close to the cities will offer a discounted rate on week days compared to the weekends as the demand for room is higher on weekends. Thus Hotels analyses their demand levels over a period of time and fix higher rates during demand period and lower room rates during low demand period.\n\nDay And Half Day Rate: These rates are charged from the guest who are not going to stay overnight in the hotel, and are always lower than the rack rate of the hotel, for e.g. if the guest checks in at 10am and checks out the same evening at a t around 5pm he may be charged the day rate .Sometimes a guest may wish to stay for a very short duration of the time,  not  exceeding  five  hours.  Then  he  is  charged  Half  Day  Rate  which  is  generally more than the numerical half of the rack rate. For eg A guest has to catch a flight after\n\n",

Group tariff is lower than the rack rate because it gives bulk business to the hotel so a hotel offers discounted rates to group. Group rates are generally negotiable on the basis  of  the  size  of  group,  length  of  stay,  past  relationship  with  the  group  operator, season, etc.\n\nTour Group: These are the highly discounted rates given to a wholesaler who operates a series of tours groups arriving and departing together. E.g. A tour operator may conduct a week's  tour  of  the  Golden  Triangle  (Delhi-Agra-Jaipur)  on  the  4th,  14th  and  24th  of every  month  for  groups  of  20  persons.  He  gives  guarantees  to  the  hotel  that  he  would provide this series of business every month for a period of 1year.\n\nTravel Agent Rate : Travel agents are those who sell travel products like hotel rooms, airline booking etc. on a commission basis to the guest, and as they provide a substantial volume of  Business  to  hotels  also  so  in  return  hotels  offers  them  special  discount  and commission etc. Thus taking commission or special favors from both the hotels and guest.

      "content": "The front office may prepare several different forecasts forms, as per their requirements. Occupancy forecasts are typically developed on a monthly basis and reviewed by food and beverage and rooms division management to forecast revenues, project expenses, and develop labor schedules. A ten-day forecast, for example, may be used to update labor scheduling and cost projections and may later be supplemented by a more current threeday forecast. Together, these forecasts help many hotel departments maintain appropriate staff levels for expected business volumes and thereby help contain costs.\n\nTen-Day Forecast: In most of the properties, the ten-day forecast is prepared jointly by the front office manager and the reservations manager with the support of their forecast committee. Many properties develop their ten-day forecast from their yearly forecast. A ten-day forecast usually consists of:\n\nA  special  ten-day  forecast  can  also  be  prepared  for  food  and  beverage,  banquet,  and catering  operations.  This  forecast  generally  includes  the  expected  number  of  guests, which is often referred to as the house count. Sometimes the house count is divided into group  and  non-group  categories  so  that  the  hotel's  dining  room  managers  can  better understand the nature of their business and their staffing needs.\n\nTo help the other departments of the hotel to plan their staffing and payroll levels for the upcoming  period,  the  ten-day  forecast  should  be  prepared  and  distributed  to  all\n\ndepartment offices by mid-week for the coming period. This forecast can be especially helpful to the housekeeping department who has to keep the staff ready for the future requirements.  A  ten-day  forecast  form,  as  shown,  is  typically  developed  from  data collected through several front office sources.\n\nFirstly,  the  current  number  of  occupied  rooms  is  reviewed.  The  estimated  numbers  of overstays  and  expected  departures  are  noted.  Next,  relevant  reservation  information  is evaluated  for  each  room  (and  guest)  by  date  of  arrival,  length  of  stay,  and  date  of departure.  These  counts  are  then  reconciled  with  reservation  control  data.  Then,  the actual  counts  are  adjusted  to  reflect  the  projected  percentage  of  no-shows,  anticipated under  stays,  and  expected  walk-ins.  These  projections  are  based  on  the  hotel's  recent history,  the  seasonality  of  its  business,  and  the  known  history  of  specific  groups scheduled to arrive. Finally, conventions and other groups are listed on the forecast to alert  various  department  managers  related  to  the  possible  periods  of  heavy,  or  light, check-ins and check-outs. The number of rooms assigned each day to each group may also be noted on the sheet.\n\nMost computer systems software's are there to provide a summary of recorded data in a report  format  for  the  use  of  front  office  manager  but  these  are  unable  to  forecast business.  Programming  to  analyze  historical  trends  and  market  conditions  has  been attempted in the past but with little success. Therefore while the computer system can assist  in  forecasting,  it  is  the  knowledge,  and  skills  of  the  front  office  manager  that determines how accurate the forecast is.\n\n",

The front office manager may assume that the front office staff is not properly promoting available guest gym services.\n\nOccupancy Ratios :  Occupancy ratios help in identifying that how successful the front office staff was in selling the hotel's primary product - guestrooms. The following room statistics must be collected to calculate basic occupancy ratios:\n\nGenerally, these data's are also available on the daily operations report.  Occupancy ratios that can be calculated from these data include occupancy percentage, multiple (or double) occupancy ratio, average daily rate, revenue per available room (Rev PAR), revenue per available  customer  (Rev  PAC),  and  average  rate  per  guest. Occupancy  percentage  and average daily rate may also be available on a property's daily operations report.  These ratios typically are calculated on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis.\n\nThe night  auditor collects  occupied rooms data  and calculates occupancy  ratios for the front office manager, and later on with its help, FOM analyzes the given information to identify trends, patterns, or problems.  When analyzing the information, the front office\n\nmanager must take into consideration how different conditions can affect occupancy.\n\n-For  example,  as  multiple  occupancy  increases,  the  average  daily  room  rate  may  also increase.  This is because, when a room is sold to more than one person, the room rate for two people in a room is usually not twice the rate for one person, the average room rate per guest decreases.\n\nOccupancy Percentage: This  is  the  most  commonly  used  operating  ratio  in  the  front office, Occupancy percentage indicates the number of rooms either sold or occupied to the number of rooms available during a specific period of time.  Where some hotels use the number of rooms sold to calculate this percentage, while other hotels use the number of  rooms occupied to calculate the statistic thereby including complimentary rooms in the calculation which can change certain operating statistics, such as average room rate etc.  Though using  rooms  sold,  or,  rooms  occupied  both  is  valid,  depending  upon  the needs and history of the property.  (Here in this unit or discussion we will use rooms occupied to illustrate the occupancy percentage calculation).\n\nSometimes even out-of-order rooms are also included in the number of rooms available as  in  some  properties  FOM evaluates management performance partly  on the basis of occupancy percentage, including out-of-order rooms in the number of rooms available, as  it  provides  the  manager  with  chance  to  get  those  rooms  fixed  and  recycled  more quickly.   Including  all  rooms  also  provides  a  consistent  base  on  which  to  measure occupancy. While on other hand, not including out-of-order rooms may allow managers to artificially increase the calculated occupancy percentage simply by mentioning unsold rooms as out-of-order.  Some properties do not include out-of-order rooms because these rooms  are  not  available  for  sale  as,  occupancy  percentage  is  required  to  evaluate  the\n\nperformance of front office staff that is having no control over out-of-order rooms, and including  those  rooms  may  unfairly  penalize  the  front  office  staff.  Regardless  of  the approach chosen, it should be used consistently. The occupancy percentage for the Hotel is calculated as follows:\n\n𝐎𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐲 % = 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦𝐬 𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 ×𝟏𝟎𝟎\n\nMultiple  Occupancy  Ratio: The  multiple  occupancy  ratio  which  is  also  sometimes called as double occupancy ratio, may not always be accurate, it is used to forecast food and beverage revenue, indicate clean linen requirements, and analyze average daily room rates.   Multiple  occupancy  can  be  calculated  by  determining  a  multiple  occupancy percentage or by determining the average number of guests per room or occupied (also called the occupancy multiplier or the multiple occupancy factor).\n\n𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐲 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐠𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭\n\n𝐌𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐎𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨 = 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦𝐬 𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐢𝐞𝐝 ×𝟏𝟎𝟎\n\nThe average number of guests per room sold is calculated as follows:\n\n𝑨𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑮𝒖𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒑𝒆𝒓 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑺𝒐𝒍𝒅 =\n\n𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑮𝒖𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒔\n\n𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔 𝑺𝒐𝒍𝒅\n\nAverage Daily Rate: Average Daily rate commonly referred to as ADR is a statistical unit  which  gives  average  rental  income  per  occupied  room  for  a  given  period.  It  is calculated by dividing Total revenue generated in a specific duration of time by the total number of rooms sold in that duration.\n\n𝐀𝐃𝐑 =\n\n𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐚 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐝\n\n𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦𝐬 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐝\n\nAverage Room Rate Per Guest: It is also called as ARG and is calculated by dividing the  total  room  revenue  by  the  total  number  of  guest  in  the  hotels  including  children above  5yrs  of  age.

Operating  ratios  are  compared  against  proper  standard-  budgeted percentage  and  any  significant  variances  can  be  identified  i.e.  it  helps  to  identifies  the areas where management must work so as to achieve budgetary goals.\n\nPayroll and related expenses or labour cost tends to be the largest single expenses for the room division as well as for the entire hotel. For control, labor costs must be analyzed on a departmental basis as Room sales fluctuates but payroll and related expenses relatively remains  constant  Hence  any  differences  between  actual  and  budgeted  labor  cost percentages must be carefully identified. it is obtained by dividing the payroll and related expenses by the room division's net room revenue yields.\n\nRatio  standards: Operating  ratios  becomes  meaningful  when  compared  against  useful criteria such as:\n\n",

For eg in order to more effectively control  labour  costs  a  front  office  manager  may  project  a  goal  for  the  current  month's labour cost percentage that is slightly lower than the previous months the expectation of lower labour  cost  percentage  may  reflect  the  front  office  manager's  efforts  to  improve scheduling  procedures  and  other  factors  related  to  the  cost  labour.  By  comparing  the actual labour cost percentage with the planned goal, the manager can measure the success of  his  efforts  to  control  labour  cost.

In fact, a 10% improvement in forecasting accuracy translates  into  a  1.5  to  3%  increase  in  revenue  generated  from  a  revenue  management system. This will probably impact the net income in a much larger way, due to the small margins  existing  in  the  hotel  industry.  Therefore,  in  addressing  the  importance  of forecasts,  one  can  state  that  forecasting  is  the  most  important  driver  of  any  revenue management optimization approach.\n\nIt  is  important  for  all  those  related  to  the  hotel  and  the  managers  must  continuously evaluate  and  assess  the  performance  of  the  hotel  with  respect  to  revenue  generation. Hotels  measures  their  performance  by  calculating  occupancy  ratios,  average  daily  rate, average room rate per guest, rev par etc, this helps them to plan for future.\n\n",
