The new world is a technology hub, the internet, social media make liaison, and connectivity  easy.  This  integration  provided  new  opportunities  for  tourism  firms  to promote tourism & hospitality, both within and outside their borders. Digitalization and technology are used to enable the managers to compile, disseminate reports in real-time, also eliminate paperwork  and  access  data  of  the  overall operations  in seconds. Housekeeping  is  one  of  the  major  departments  in  any  accommodation  establishment, and  Housekeeping  is  the  face  of  any  lodging.  It  is  making  the  stay  comfortable  and responsible for the cleaning, hygiene, safety, and security of the establishment.\n\nThis manual is a book intended to be used primarily as a coursebook for the students; the material compiled from class lectures, already shared with the students. Some books references and weblinks are mentioned in the end, and maybe some references are not mentioned;  therefore,  my  apology  from  the  researchers  may  kindly  be  accepted.  This manual  demonstrated some  essential practical work for the necessary skills in Housekeeping  Leisure  and  hospitality  linked  sector.  The  idea  is  to  provide  an  easily understandable and useful manual for the students' hospitality industry.\n\nThis  manual is carefully designed to  complete  the  subject's requirements  in  managing housekeeping  operations.  However,  the  book  also  provides  valuable  information  as  a Textbook for hospitality schools and colleges.\n\nDr. Mohammad Alam Assistant Professor Department of Tourism & Hospitality\n\nHazara University. alampices@gmail.com\n\n",
