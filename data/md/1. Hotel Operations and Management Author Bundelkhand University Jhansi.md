##  FACTORS AFFECTING STAFFING:SIZE OF HOTEL , LOCATION, STANDARD OF SERVICE, TYPE OF GUEST , LEVEL OF AUTOMATION , FRONT OFFICE WORKSHIFT

The proper staffing and scheduling for the Front Desk is a variable science. This means that it will be different for each hotel depending on some key factors:

-  What are the check-in and check-out patterns? Some hotels have a large all at once rush at the desk, such as an airport or convention hotel, or they can have a slow trickling traffic pattern such as a luxury or leisure hotel.
-  What available staffing budget can be supported? Are there supervisors who can fill in and reduce hours or help at peak times?
-  The size of the hotel - A larger hotel will have more activity that requires guest support and activity. These hotels require more staff.
-  Occupancy Levels - Regardless of the size of hotel, the amount of occupied rooms and when they arrive and depart also is a factor.
-  Service Requirements of the Hotel - Some hotels have concierge services, transportation, or may or may not have to have the desk staff also act as PBX and/or Reservations.

## The Formula

The basic rule of thumb for staffing front office is:

-  (2) Minimum positions per shift can cover up to an average 100-150 room checkout
-  On slower days, one position can be staffed by a supervisor or management
-  Night Audit (11PM-7AM) can be one position unless there are security risks and a second may be added for safety reasons.
-  A third position should be added at 150 rooms or more.

Size - Or number of rooms

Under 200 rooms

200 to 399 rooms

400 to 700 rooms

More than 700 rooms

The above categories enable hotels of similar size to compare operating procedures and statistical results.
