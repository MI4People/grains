## Letter from the Author

## Dear Reader,

Congratulations on joining the ever expanding world of hotels worldwide. Your decision to join hotels gives you ample access to global careers. You have chosen that part of hotel operations that maintains the glamour of a hotel. The Housekeeping Department is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance, and aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. The department also maintains the most essential product of a hotel-the rooms . This role of the Housekeeping Department makes it crucial for a hotel as rooms contribute substantially to the revenue of the hotel. For you, as a future housekeeping professional, it is important to adopt the international practices, attitudes, and behaviours that are presented in this book.

My first book, Hotel Housekeeping Training Manual , has been in print for over two decades now. My readers, by showing their faith in my book, have encouraged me to write this third edition. The basic processes of housekeeping operations worldwide remain still the same as they were two decades ago, and shall not change much in future. However, the application of these processes has changed over the time, largely due to information technology and globalisation. This book attempts to empower housekeeping professionals with the knowledge of these new changes to meet the challenges of the future.

Let us examine some of the changes in travel and hotelkeeping that have emerged recently:

The guests today are global citizens who travel frequently, thanks to faster transport and better infrastructure. Now, the traveller can choose her/his 'home away from home' from the comfort of her/his home or office by using websites that  take  him  on  virtual  tours  of  hotels  showing  guest  rooms  and  facilities with pricing options to suit all kinds of budgets. Not only this, she/he can also reserve a room for herself/himself as hotels, nowadays, also use websites to make reservations for the customers with the help of Reservation Distribution Systems. Such prior reservations ensure that the guest finds a room booked in her/his name upon her/his arrival in the hotel.

<!-- image -->

The modern traveller, being more aware of housekeeping standards, now expects a certain level of service during her/his stay in the hotel. She/he demands a high degree of cleanliness and sanitation. Now, using Information Technology, the traveller can customise her/his or her requirements on a user-friendly form on the web. The web searches and selects those hotels that meet the specifications given by the traveller, offering him a deluge of options. A woman traveller may want a hair dryer and ironing board in her room while a businessman may want teleconferencing facilities and secretarial services during her/his stay. There are no limits to guests' needs and the web accesses those hotels that attend to these needs at the click of a button. Hence, it has now become essential that the

viii

housekeeping staff should anticipate and respond to guests' expectations as loyalty of the guests towards the establishment is at stake.

Large investments in creating opulent hotel spaces have no meaning unless these are maintained in pristine condition in spite of frequent use.

Downsizing is part of the new economic business strategy. Downsizing means the reduction of staff and unprofitable operations to keep overheads to the affordable limit. The result is that fewer people are retained and paid more to increase their productivity. If a room attendant once cleaned 12 rooms in an eight-hour shift which used to increase at the most to 14 rooms, she/he is now normally allocated 16 rooms in a shift. This new standard of 16 rooms per room

<!-- image -->

attendant in a shift has been made possible by equpping the room attendants with better training; efficient equipment; competent supply systems; and a lot more autonomy. They are now required to multitask roles. Similarly, a floor supervisor is no longer only an inspector but is also required to handle guest complaints, and control inventory and budget. Her/his set of skills has become wider and now she/he is expected to show competency in first-aid, fire-drills, report-writing, budgeting, training, motivation, problem-solving, and decision-making. The floor supervisor is now expected to become an intrapreneur (internal entrepreneur). She/he is required to think like an investor and be cost, quality, and productivity conscious.

Empowerment is the logical consequence of downsizing. Empowerment encourages employees to control their own performance to meet business goals. A floor supervisor has now the authority to provide additional guest amenities and services to regular guests. Executive Housekeepers are now permitted to develop personal rapport with guests by writing letters to them and inviting them to visit the hotel again. The room attendant is also given total control of floor operations and held accountable for the total guest experience. So we see that organisations now, in order to facilitate instant decision-making and following the principle of 'lean is beautiful,' are empowering their staff by equipping them with skills of the managers' profile and by giving them authority to perform tasks earlier executed only by the managers. Hotel personnel have now become knowledge workers as they are equipped with technical knowledge, information, competencies, and skills to execute and fulfil higher responsibilities.

Leasing is another new business strategy and is becoming a way of hotel life. Investors now believe that standalone hotels are unlikely to give the return on investments. A hotel now has to be a part of a community complex with shopping malls, cineplexes, entertainment centres, furnished apartments, convention centre,  and  office  blocks,  all  set  in  spectacular  environments with landscaping and watercourses. The housekeeping role has changed accordingly as a housekeeper is required to act either as consultant to lease holders or to manage housekeeping roles beyond the traditional frontiers of a hotel to include additional

<!-- image -->

facilities as maintaining entertainment centres, cineplexes, etc. Housekeeping with its expertise could also become a profit centre earning revenues for the establishment.

## Letter from the Author

<!-- image -->

Rooms Focus: A hotel investor concentrates on room revenues only, which is another form of leasing. She/he likes to increase the number of rooms to distribute overhead costs. Moreover, rooms give a greater contribution to profits. So hotel investors generally like to create one captive all-purpose dining room, or a coffee shop, and bar, in a hotel while leasing other spaces within the hotel's premises to branded restaurants like TGIF, Chillis, etc. This leasing is exercised with strong legal instruments.

Franchised Operations: Hotel  investors  have  seen  the  virtue  of  linking  their  hotels  with internationally  acclaimed  hotel  chain  operations  having  the  muscle  of  economies  of  scale, reputation, professional management, standardised systems and procedures, common advertising budgets, and technical support. This has prompted me to bring in the subject of 'Hotel Chain Associations' in Lesson 2.

Information Technology has  taken  over  all  the  processing  work. Innovative software and mainframe servers make accurate and productive information quickly available. Reports are churned out by the minute to make operational decision-making respond to daily changes. Most lessons give the role of automation in the sub-spheres of housekeeping operations.

<!-- image -->

Outsourcing services is another strategy to manage downsizing. Outsourcing means giving the responsibility of certain aspects of operations to external experts and consultants. The obligation of the hotel is to pay a contracted fee and set standards required by the organisation. This has become a way of life in most organisations. Large hotels are outsourcing their housekeeping, accounting, security, horticulture, laundry, food preparation, etc. This is because of the several reasons such as:

-  High energy costs to maintain these departments.
-  High cost of raw materials, especially those that are imported.
-  High labour costs and the availability of skilled personnel.
-  High costs of real estate to accommodate non-revenue operations.
-  Rapid changes in technology and the expertise required to keep pace with it.
-  Outsourced businesses attain mastery in their specialisation.
-  Quality movements require different expertise and certification for several sub-functions.

The call for outsourcing has seen the mushrooming of specialist companies like the Housekeeping  &  Maintenance Companies, Security Companies, Landscaping and Horticultural services, Industrial  laundries,  branded  restaurants,  etc. This  in  itself  has  opened  additional  employment opportunities  to  hotel  professionals. These  outsourced  services  have  to  adhere  to  the  hotel policies while retaining their individual identity. All this is established with well-designed legal instruments.  Hiring  the  right  consultants  becomes  important  for  the  hotel  management  but getting the right talent becomes a challenge. I have discussed the roles and competencies of the new housekeeping professional in the 'Introduction' of this book.

Youth will be the future workforce. Mature professionals will have to re-engineer themselves to consider self-employment ( see 'Housekeeping as a Career' in the 'Introduction'). They could either open their own businesses or turn into outsourced specialists. Hotels prefer youth for various reasons:

-  They are better informed through the advancement in education.
-  They bring the latest technologies and ideas.
-  They keep the workforce fresh.

-  Multi-roles require high energy and longer hours.
-  They are ambitious to earn more.
-  They are hungry for success.
-  They enjoy working and are open to new ideas.
-  They come with better competencies.

In spite of the whirlwind of change, the housekeeping specialist will continue to be there to faithfully create a 'home away from home' for the guest. Gone are the days when a service professional went to a hotel, did her/his job in an eight-hour shift, and returned home. Housekeeping professionals will have to think like an entrepreneur and be empowered to respond to changing business situations and customers constantly ( see the section of the 'Introduction' titled 'The Future Guest').

This book has been carefully written to serve several segments of the hotel industry. This book, therefore, is ideal for:

-  Housekeeping professionals
-  Hotel Management students
-  Craft course students of Housekeeping
-  Lecturers of Hotel Management and Craft services
-  Apprentices in housekeeping
-  New entrants who have no formal training or education in housekeeping but are entering the industry raw
-  Housekeeping and maintenance companies
-  Entrepreneurs who wish to set up their own housekeeping company
-  Training centres of hotels
-  Independent hotel owners and staff
-  Hospitality trainers

Readers, it is time to shed the old coat and wear the new one of this new exciting millennium. I wish all of you the best of luck in your pursuit of becoming the new housekeeping professional. I hope this edition will be your able companion throughout your career. I may be contacted by e-mail at Sudhir\_andrews@hotmail.com. Good Luck!

## Part 11: Other Housekeeping Knowledge

## Introduction

## \ THE FUTURE GUEST

The revolution brought about by cyberspace has changed everything around us, including the traveller. People can now cross boundaries of their country from the comforts of their homes at  the click of a mouse button. This has made them knowledgeable and adventurous. People have moved beyond the political boundaries of their countries to survive in global economies. The movement of people to places like the Middle East, USA, etc. for jobs, has made them more accessible to hard currencies, cultures, cuisines, and customs. Technology has made travel quicker and easier.  The web has shrunk the world into a global village. The housekeeping professional, as a consequence, has been

<!-- image -->

presented with new challenges in the midst of these changes. The new housekeeping professionals should be aware of and sensitive to the changes in attitudes of the guests who come to their hotel.

Woman Power: Women have entered all possible professions-from airline pilots to corporate

executives-which were earlier considered to be male territories. Balancing their home and career, they now represent a substantial part of travelling public and expect special attention to be given to their specific needs. They expect hair dryers, ironing facilities, extra security features, privacy, etc. in their rooms. Eating and drinking alone in public bars and restaurants may not be a common custom in many cultures and therefore, women require efficient room service with menus

<!-- image -->

that suit the diet conscious. Many expect an array of television channels, to keep abreast of their popular soap operas on television, and satellite communication, to keep in touch with their homes.

Business Wealth: Private enterprises have reached horizons never imagined before. Worldwide investments and access to big capital funds have fostered big businesses. Giants like the aerospace industry, computer industry, courier services, and credit cards have overtaken oil, automobiles or shipping industries. Individuals too have amassed incredible wealth. Software professionals have become millionaires overnight by creating just one unique software program. The result of this wealth is that business executives and entrepreneurs expect high quality rooms and business services to make an impression of their financial strength on their clients. They expect well-equipped business centres in the hotel and facilities such as secretarial services, videoconferencing, and telecommunication services as never before. In the room, they expect facilities for easy worldwide communications and unobtrusive housekeeping services that keep their rooms clean and sanitised.

Emotional Experiences: Guests have become adventurous. They want total experiences that trigger emotions. A perfect experience is one that appeals to all the senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. The eyes like to see unique costumes, pleasant interior lighting, evidence of cleanliness and

xx

sanitation, and aesthetic room presentations and décor. Guests want their hotel experience to touch their egos, creative tastes, need for adventure, and most of all, their heart. They like to hear silence and touch the softness of bed and bath linen just as much as they want to smell freshness in a room. They may touch the underside of sinks or chest of drawers to ascertain whether there is dust or not. The way the housekeeping staff gives the service, contributes largely to the touching experience. They expect staff to anticipate their needs and respond efficiently to them. Guests

<!-- image -->

today are very demanding and patronise hotels that recognise their special ways.

Time Conscious: The new guest of this fast-paced world is time conscious and is willing to perform

tasks herself/himself to save on time. Many guests are quite willing to go to the floor pantry to set ice and cold snacks for themselves. They are willing to prepare their own morning tea or coffee in their rooms rather than depend on a slow-paced room service. Guests want speedy responses to their demands for additional blankets or cleaning services so that they can move on with their fast-paced lives. Guests want immediacy and do not tolerate delays.

Health Conscious: Guests are working hard at keeping fit and healthy. New research has made people aware of benefits of healthy living. As a result, health clubs, gyms, and swimming pools have become popular. Guests have also become nutritionally conscious. This is why health foods have crept into many menus.  Food preferences extend to vegetarian and fat-free dishes. Some want saltless food while others want cholesterol-free preparations. In the room, they need the freshness of a non-smoking room or the sanitisation of drinking glasses or toilet bowls. Many may inspect their bedsheets for stains before sleeping in them or smell their pillow for freshness before laying their head on them. They can sue hotels for unhygienic conditions. Most governments give importance to healthy and hygienic conditions in hotel service areas. Litigations on this count proves to be expensive for the establishment and also leads to bad publicity.

Value-addition: This refers to the extras given for a particular price. For example, business executives may expect a free limousine service from the airport to the hotel, free business lounge services, free newspapers, and even a free breakfast included in the price they are paying for a hotel room; women may want free admission to the sauna and Turkish baths; families may want free baby-sitting services while on their vacations;  guests may want extra pillows or blankets, bathrobes and bath slippers, and vanity supplies like shampoos, moisturisers, shaving creams, and razors in the room. Most quality hotels provide these at the room price only without charging any extra money for them.

Information: Curiosity has spurred guests to travel which has been made easy by quicker transportation and economy holiday packages. Guests do expect high and authentic standards of service and have no patience for fakes. They want information of the hotel facilities at their fingertips without having to ask anyone. They want access to their room bills on their TV sets to be able to monitor their budgets and expenditures.

D-I-Y Competent: Guests now are willing to do things themselves (D-I-Y stands for Do-it-Yourself). While the western person is normally manually competent, the vast population of oriental people who have migrated to the west, where domestic help is not available,  have also learned to help themselves. Rooms now are fitted with mini-bars, microwave ovens, and tea/coffee stations. Floor

## Introduction

foyers or pantries have shoe-polishing machines, and vending machines for ice, and hot and cold snacks. One of the benefits of self-help is that it reduces time for the guest who is in a hurry.

Techno-savvy: In addition to D-I-Y competency, guests are comfortable in using the web and like to take control of their living experience over the web and via phone. They want to make their room reservation from the comfort of their homes and expect it to be honoured when they reach. They want to place their own wake-up calls in automated systems or have access to their bills in the room television monitor.

Language Savvy: While English is still the popular language in the global economy, hotels with multi-lingual housekeeping staff are able to attract and deal with multinational clientele. Where French and German were the common international

<!-- image -->

alternatives for English before, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, and Japanese have now become necessary for the emerging business communities.

Point Casting: The term relates to specialisation in a very narrow field. Guests patronise hotels, which have achieved consistent excellence and authority in a narrow field. This has created busi-

ness hotels, convention hotels, casino hotels, group hotels, etc. each providing to a specific client segment its particular needs. Business hotels provide for instance, business centres with meeting rooms, secretarial services, office processing equipment, and worldwide telecommunication facilities. Rooms are equipped with writing desks, telecommunication facilities, internet connections, etc. Group hotels may provide group check-ins with minimum delay, buffets, coach services, doctor services, handicapped facilities, and multi-lingual staff

for the demands of a group. Housekeeping staff must be aware of the market segment for which the hotel has positioned itself as different types of establishments like casino, resort, business, convention, etc. cater to different market segments.

## \ THE NEW HOUSEKEEPING PROFESSIONAL

Cyberspace has forced the world to see things in different ways. It has shrunk the world into a global village and we are now witnessing true globalisation. What does globalisation mean? It means that people have access to products and services worldwide, at the click of a button. We are in the service age where the customer is the centrepiece. The key mission of cyberspace is to create value for the customer. In this new age, housekeeping professional has now become a frontline personnel also as he is in direct contact with guests.

Let us see how roles and competencies of frontline staff will change in future:

## Frontline Staff

Relational: Frontline personnel will be good at customer relations with strong interpersonal skills. They will make people interaction a joyful art. They will be adept at remembering faces and names and be able to remember the  special needs of regular guests. They shall keep elaborate guest history records to note special needs of the guests in the past, and respond to them whenever these guests will come again in the hotel. Frontline staff will be skilled in handling difficult guests and know exactly what to do in emergency situations.

Multilingual: Frontline personnel will have a good command over the English language. However, the housekeeping professional will also learn other languages such as Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Spanish. Frontline teams will be assembled to provide a range of language options to international clientele. Upcountry establishments will further need skills in local dialects. With multilingual skills, hotel professionals will greatly enhance their job opportunities globally.

Service-oriented: The future frontline staff will genuinely enjoy serving people and develop it into an art. They would acquire all the technical, interpersonal, and management skills to give an excellent guest experience. They will use technology to assist them in the process. Guest Histories on common servers will help fine-tune their awareness of guest needs and preferences. Computers will help in speedier service to an ever impatient guest who is perpetually in a hurry.

Creative Problem-solvers: Frontline staff will be skilled in problem-solving and decision-making. Managements will empower them to make on-the-spot decisions to enhance the guest experience. For example, a room attendant may be able to provide a regular guest with an additional vanity set if requested or a second or third service, if demanded.

Action-oriented: Frontline staff of the future will support promises with actions. If a room attendant promises the front office agent a cleared room in twenty minutes for a guest waiting to check in, she will be obliged to honour that time frame. If the floor supervisor promises to provide a baby-sitter to a guest by an allotted time in the evening, she/he will have to fulfill the promise to maintain quality service.

Techno-savvy: Frontline personnel of the future will be comfortable with fast changing technologies and environments that affect them. Software for hotel operations like Fidelio already exists. New recruits from hotel schools will come skilled in operating such software. Training programmes for the housekeeping personnel will focus on how to help them adapt to new changes in procedures and technologies. In future, even a room attendant will be able to change fused bulbs in rooms or resolve minor television problems.

Commission-oriented: Service staff will prefer to work on commissions as part of their compensation packages. They will be able to generate substantial secondary income through commissions and

## Introduction

bonuses. Hotels will provide a salary to cover the cost of living together with incentive packages to motivate direct revenue generating personnel to bring in new customers or generate additional revenues from regular clients by upselling. Each housekeeper may have her/his own database of regular clients to whom she/he provides personalised service. Guests prefer to take their business to hotels where professionals who know their lifestyle and preferences work, rather than cultivating their relationships again with new professionals. Housekeeping professionals can get commissions for repeat guests or they can get bonuses for the good feedback given by guests and the number of times they return to the hotel.

Multi-skilled: Service professionals of future will have management skills, technological skills, customer skills, and reporting skills. This makes the erstwhile Housekeeper a knowledge worker. The titles will also change to accommodate their new roles such as Hosts, Floor Relationship Executives, Customer Service Hostesses, etc. Multi-skilling is a strategy to reduce staff, pay better wages to those remaining, and have the flexibility to deploy them where there is a need. Housekeepers will learn to prepare guest rooms, take responsibilities in public areas, handle laundry tasks, manage the control desk operations, and manage floral decoration and landscaping. Housemen will double up as bell boys and houseman at resort properties, and even the Housekeeper will man the reception in smaller hotels.

Physically Fit: Frontline staff will have to be physically fit. They will have to be energetic to work actively and enthusiastically for long hours on their feet. The new housekeeping professional will enroll into a gym and make daily exercise a way of life. They will be diet-conscious and realise that their appearance is their fortune and that hotels and guests expect the smartest frontline staff.

Grooming: While hotels have traditionally given importance to grooming as part of the hotel culture, frontline personnel will take their own initiatives to seek the advice of beauty consultants to know the best way they can present themselves. The new frontline professional will visit salons regularly to look presentible. Consciousness about grooming has increased so much in society that now salons for men have also opened to give a perfect manicure and hair cut to them.

## Backline Specialists

Specialists  like  the  Executive  Housekeeper,  Interior  Designer,  Horticulturist,  Florist,  Laundry Manager, Linen Keeper, etc. will enrich the frontline performance with their expertise. They would either be standalone specialists or members of project teams who address special problems and innovations. Housekeepers are moving towards becoming internal consultants to hotel complexes that have large leasing operations for various businesses such as restaurants, beauty salons, shop owners, entertainment centres, etc.

Mastery in Functional Area: The specialists will believe in continuous learning as a way of life to bring the best practices available in their field. They might have a high level of education and experience to give organisations a leading edge; however, they would do some research and find ways to beat competition with new models of performance. They will act as consultants to the organisation rather than just paid employees.

Creative in Applications: Specialists would not be bureaucratic and rigid in their approach. Their skills would be to find solutions to existing problems and will develop new ways to enhance guest experience. This requires innovation, research, cross-modification skills, and candour. Above all they must be thoroughly aware of systems and procedures.

xxiv

Technically-Oriented: Service personnel would be comfortable with technology and may guide software developers in developing new applications for their sphere of operations. They will become active members of development teams.

Loyal to their Profession: Backline specialists will believe in their profession and will commit themselves to excellence. They will benchmark themselves with other noted professionals and organisations in the field, so as to introduce best practices into the organisation.

Ability to Work in Various Teams: Problems that need a variety of specialist input will be solved in teams. For example, new guest history software will require IT specialists, guest relations executive, lobby manager, front office manager, front desk agents, order-takers, housekeepers, telephone operators, etc. They will have to work in teams with each member being a resource to the project. This type of working will require interpersonal skills, negotiation skills, problem-solving skills, listening skills, assertion, and knowledge.

Focus on Continuing Education: Specialists will invest in their self-development from their own pockets. They will use substantial part of their income in continuing their education. Obsolescence is the greatest fear of the new millennium. Hotel professionals will have to continue learning to keep up to the latest developments and avoid obsolescence.

## \ HOUSEKEEPING AS A CAREER

## Introduction

We often wonder how all the premises like offices, conference centres, malls, movie theatres, etc. are kept clean and attractive. This is the work of a silent but large workforce called housekeeping . Housekeeping is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance, and aesthetic upkeep of the entire premises-both externally and internally. It is an extension of basic housekeeping multiplied into commercial proportions. Therefore, just as we enjoy keeping a sparkling home, the housekeeping department takes pride in keeping a sparkling hotel to create a 'home away from home.'

The concept of housekeeping is simplistic but when one considers maintaining a house of several hundreds rooms and numerous public areas, the task becomes gigantic and more complex. It takes a well organised approach and technical understanding to enable housekeeping to cope with the volume of work.

A hotel survives largely on the sale of rooms which contributes a minimum of 50 per cent to revenues. In other words, a hotel's largest margin of profit comes from room sales because a room, once built, can be sold over and over again.

The room sale depends on the quality of room décor, room facilities, cleanliness of the room, and how safe it is. To make a room appealing to a guest is the task of housekeeping which has to ensure that the basic human needs of comfort and security are present in the room. The personal effort of the housekeeping department has a direct bearing on the guest experience in a hotel. This is achieved by trained staff, specialised equipment and tools, cleaning solutions, and proper systems and procedures. Housekeeping, as mentioned before, encompasses three major functions:

- 1.  Cleaning
- 2.  Maintenance
- 3.  Aesthetic upkeep of the property

Let us look at each to understand their full implications:

## Cleaning

Cleaning is not just having a duster cloth in hand and wiping surfaces. While it may include that activity too, it requires a comprehensive understanding of different surfaces and the best tools and solutions to clean them to preserve the long life of those surfaces.  There are different surfaces in a large commercial operation like a hotel that pose a challenge for the housekeeper. First she must have the knowledge of these surfaces and their properties; then the technical knowledge of how best she can clean them. She must also know how to manage different degrees of stains and soil.

All the surfaces require independent understanding of their use and their properties. Part 9 deals extensively with this subject.

## Maintenance

Housekeeping identifies and follows up on those items that are malfunctioning or defective throughout the facility and ensures that they are rectified with engineering support. Since housekeeping has access to all parts of a facility in the execution of their cleaning role, they are the right people to locate deficiencies and report them to the engineering support for rectification. Engineering sup-

port comes in the way of electrical, mechanical, civil, carpentry, plumbing, and any masonry work. The housekeeping staff, for example, will identify corridor lights that are not working; bathroom taps that are leaking; lobby chairs that wobble; or meeting room walls that show water seepage. Housekeeping has an effective communication system with engineering to alert and rectify problems. In some establishments, housekeeping staff are trained to attend to some basic engineering needs such as changing fused bulbs, attending to defective TV connections, or changing a washer of a leaking tap.

## Aesthetic Upkeep

Aesthetic upkeep refers to the effort taken to beautify the property. This includes landscaping around the premises as well as providing flower arrangements and decorations in internal public areas and offices. To do this, the housekeeper has to have basic knowledge of horticulture including the maintenance of nurseries and green houses. She is also concerned with floral art to keep interiors attractive. At this stage, we must be clear about the difference between the role of housekeeping and the internal designer.  The interior designer decides on the theme, colour furniture, and fixtures of facilities while  the housekeeper maintains the facility as conceived by the interior designer. Some accomplished housekeepers may even be qualified interior decorators.

## Career Paths

A person who chooses housekeeping as a career may enter the profession by attaining certain professional qualifications. The chart below gives the correlation of various certification required at different entry points in a hotel. It also charts out the career path for those without the minimum educational qualifications:

One observes in the chart above that there are two paths (shown by arrows) to reach higher positions. One path is a direct entry level which requires a minimum educational qualification with training to fill the position. In that stream there are several educational options:

- 1.  A person can join housekeeping at the lowest skilled level after having completed junior high school or a minimum 10 years of schooling. They could join directly and receive on-the-job training by the hiring organisation for minimum durations as per their policy.
- 2.  Alternatively, the candidate can enroll into an institution that provides technical education. Governments in most countries provide trade qualifications for different professions in their effort to encourage skills to feed the hotel industry. It is also a measure to empower individuals to acquire gainful employment. In India, the Indian Technical Institutes are a good example of such technical education. The Department of  Tourism in India has supported State Tourism Departments to create the Food Craft Institutes to provide technical qualifications for the hospitality industry. All technical institutes provide trade certificates.
- 3.  A person may enter the housekeeping profession with a high school certificate or a minimum 12 years in school. Such students do a three-year diploma that qualifies them to enter the hospitality industry at supervisory levels. Diploma students will further need about six months practical training in housekeeping in the hotel to be confirmed as a supervisor.
- 4.  At management levels, the minimum educational qualification for a direct entry would be a Bachelor Degree in Hotel Management. In spite of the degree, the candidate would require one-year training in housekeeping with the hotel that hires them. This training is to give students a practical exposure to real life housekeeping. Graduate students of other disciplines like liberal arts, social sciences, science or commerce who opt for a housekeeping career will need 18 months to two years on-the-job training and classroom lectures to qualify as a housekeeping supervisor.

- 5.  Those aspiring for senior management levels require a minimum graduation preferably in hotel management. This would have to be supported by a minimum three years of experience in an earlier position to qualify for the post.

We also notice that those who do not have the educational qualification for entry can also aspire for higher positions given a minimum adequate experience in an earlier position. We must understand that higher positions require not only knowledge of the trade but also the administrative inputs.

## FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

## 1. Does a career in housekeeping attract good salaries?

The salaries at skilled and supervisory levels are adequate for a basic standard of living supported by statutory perquisites such as annual leave, leave fares to one's hometown and back, medical coverage, medical leave including extended maternity leave, and house rent allowance. Most hotels support the salary with job-related benefits such as free duty meals, uniforms, laundering of uniforms, transportation to and from home and overtime. These make earnings more than comfortable. At management levels, the earning power makes a quantum leap with perks and benefits equal to any other profession within hotels and other industries. Management salaries are comparable to other management positions in the industry.

## 2. What status does housekeeping have in the hospitality industry?

Housekeeping is crucial to hotel operations. All departments lean on them for the proper facilitation of their work. They do respect the department and give them full cooperation. In recognition of this, the Executive Housekeeper holds a senior position equivalent to a Food and Beverage Manager, Front Office Manager, etc. reporting directly to the General Manager. Chain operations also employ a Corporate Housekeeper who is the senior most housekeeping resource to guide hotel general managers of the chain.

## 3. Can I become a General Manager of a hotel if I were an Executive Housekeeper?

While there are few cases of Executive Housekeepers who have risen to General Manager's positions, it is normally unlikely. Housekeeping is considered as a specialist position and not a generalist one. Housekeeping, however, has its own hierarchy that is equivalent or even more senior to a General Manager's position. There are positions as Director Housekeeping, Area Executive Housekeepers, or Corporate Housekeepers who earn good salaries as well as command a status equivalent to other senior positions.

## 4. Is housekeeping a woman's profession?

Traditionally, housekeeping has been dominated by women. This was done on the belief that the hotel was an extension of the home and that women had the best skills and competencies to execute the function well. However, men have entered this profession and have succeeded equally well. Hotels may choose a male for many reasons:

- 1.  Some countries like those in the Gulf  that uphold traditional Islamic values may not permit women to work in public locations such as guest rooms.
- 2.  Chains find it difficult to transfer a woman from one hotel to another as they would be uprooting her domestic links.
- 3.  Women start careers and abandon them when they get married and start a family due to social and family commitments.

## 5. Who employs qualified housekeepers apart from hotels?

Readers would be surprised to see the range of businesses that employ housekeepers and other housekeeping personnel:

Airlines, Airports, Casinos, Cine-complexes, Commercial Offices, Condominiums, Convention Centres, Cruise liners, Entertainment Centres, Exhibition Centres, Food Courts, Hospitals, Hotels, Independent Restaurants, Museums, Railways, Residential Apartments, Resorts, Schools and Colleges, Shopping Malls, Sports arenas, Studios, Theme Parks, Training Centres, etc.

There are plenty of opportunities worldwide for the serious housekeeping professional.

## \ TRAINING METHODOLOGY

This training manual is fashioned to be the core text for training in housekeeping service. It, therefore, has adopted the following features:

-  It is divided into lessons.
-  It is concise, eliminating unwanted words.
-  It is sequenced in the way that the subject should be learnt.
-  It adopts a simple language.
-  Terminologies are explained carefully and re-emphasised in Key Terms at the end of each lesson.
-  The text can be used for self-learning as well as by a trainer.
-  It acts as a ready reference for those in a hurry.
-  It deals with direct housekeeping operations.

Any good training deals with four aspects:

- 1. Knowledge -the foundation of information required to perform a task effectively
- 2. Skills -the logical and motor skills required to complete tasks
- 3. Attitudes -the emotional way we interact with the environment (workplace)
- 4. Competencies -the behaviours required in a job to be effective

This  manual  has  been  divided  into  those  components. The  competencies  are  mentioned  in Lesson 7 titled 'Competencies of a Housekeeping Professional.' Trainers and learners must look at this lesson in the context of the four aspects of good training.

From the many training methodologies available, I have suggested the following methodologies in this manual as they are practical and in common use already:

## Lecture

## Demonstration

## Practice

On-the-Job Training

Ideas expressed orally . It is usually a one-way communication from trainer to trainee. This may not ensure complete learning. It is advised that  trainers  get  more  participative  in  the  session  by  asking  them questions so that they think for themselves. A question answer session at the end will complete any doubts and give the trainer a feedback to ascrtain whether the trainees have understood the ideas. The trainer must use illustrative training aids which will be discussed later.

A performance of a skill by the trainer while learners watch . This is an effective method that improves learning. The trainer will naturally have to assemble the various equipment, tools, ingredients (as in the case  of  cooking),  and  accessories  in  advance  to  ensure  the  smooth flow of the session.

An opportunity for learners to perform what they have learnt . There are bound to be mistakes initially till the trainee achieves proficiency. The more the practice the greater is the chance of attaining proficiency. Most demonstrations must be followed by practice.

The method is employed when learners have acquired a certain level of proficiency before they are put into live situations . This is the most

effective method of learning. The main challenge is to perform tasks under time pressure and while dealing with guests.

The method employs learners to act out scenes of real situations but in simulated conditions . The learners can afford to commit mistakes without serious consequences. Most competencies and guest relation skills are best taught by role-play.

These are guided visits to actual work sites for learners to translate their knowledge into practical orientations . It is effective for learners to actually see and touch real equipment, accessories, and visualise real layouts guided by the principles learnt in the classroom.

Most methodologies come alive with support materials called training aids . Here are some of the aids suggested in the manual that work well with the methodologies suggested above:

White Board

Flip Charts

PowerPoint

Samples

It is inexpensive and reusable. Most training classrooms are equipped with it.

This is a flip-over chart paper hung on an easel. The benefit of this aid is that many diagrams can be prepared in advance for a session. Flip charts have the advantage of recording important points in the classroom discussion for use later in the session.

In today's world of computers, the PowerPoint software is a marvel that  comes  with  most  Microsoft  packages.  The  advantage  is  that presentations can be made more colourful. and with some animation features. The computer will require an LCD projector with necessary accessories to project the matter. Such projectors are expensive.

These are actual exhibits like bottles, ingredients, forms, and formats, etc.    that  can  be  brought  in  a  classroom.  These  are  essential  for demonstration purposes and enhance understanding of the trainees.

## OVERVIEW

## Types of Hotels

<!-- image -->

To help the reader understand the meaning of a hotel and its hotel while working for it.

## WHAT IS A HOTEL?

British Law defines a 'Hotel' or 'Inn' as 'a place where a bona fide traveller can receive food and shelter, provided he/she is in a position to pay for it and is in a fit condition to be received'. Therefore, a hotel must provide food (and beverages) and lodging to travellers on payment and has, in turn, the right to refuse admission if the traveller is drunk, disorderly, unkempt or is not in a position to pay for the services.

By this  definition,  a  hotel  must  provide  rooms  and  meals. The provision  of  beverages  is  subject  to  local  customs  and  practices. Therefore, in Europe and America, bars are an important part of hotel facilities, while in Islamic countries, bars may be considered a taboo on religious grounds. The right of admission is reserved in all hotels and many of them display that sign prominently at their doorways or reception. A hotel can refuse accommodation to a guest if he/she is not in a fit and orderly state. With this tradition, hotels have always been a place where visitors and guests always dress their best.

## HOTEL CATEGORIES

<!-- image -->

With the evolution of hotels and their proliferation around the world, it is impossible to categorise them under one term. This has been made easier for readers by classifying them under several categories:

- (i) Location
- (ii) Number of Rooms
- (iii) Ownership

<!-- image -->

- (iv) Pricing Plan
- (v) Type of Clientele
- (vi) Length of Guest Stay
- (vii) Facilities Offered
- (viii) Other Lodging Concepts

Let us examine each one of them in detail:

## Location

Hotels are classified by their location as follows:

- Downtown
- Suburban
- Resort
- Airport
- Motel
- Camp

## Downtown Hotels

Downtown Hotels are located at the centre of the city in busy commercial and shopping districts. Their features are:

- 1. Close to government and private offices, shopping malls and entertainment centres.
- 2. High hotel room rates as the price of land is expensive.
- 3. Quality hotels meant for moneyed clientele, usually the business and corporate community. Upmarket groups may also find downtown hotels affordable.
- 4. Cater to guests on short visits lasting maximum one week.
- 5. Have leading restaurants, bars and night clubs.
- 6. Close to day and night shopping, eateries and entertainment and, therefore, may cut costs by having only bars and an all-purpose coffee shop off the lobby.
- 7. Modern downtown hotels have purpose-built shopping malls with food courts, residential apartments, commercial offices and cineplexes attached to their hotel, creating self-contained communities.
- 8. Built upwards as tower blocks because of a lack of space.

Housekeeping personnel have to travel by elevators to reach higher floors while chutes in tower

blocks transport soiled linen to the laundry quickly. The real challenge is to provide speedy quality service in a fast turnover hotel which increases if hotels

become community complexes.

## Suburban Hotels

Suburban hotels are located on the outskirts of a city where land is cheaper. Their features are:

- 1. Have sprawling constructions with ample parking spaces.
- 2. Attract  cost-conscious  clientele,  though  not  necessarily  budget travellers.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Types of Hotels

- 3. Ideal for training programmes, conferences and seminars as participants find a peaceful environment to learn.
- 4. Have quick and efficient local transportation to make travel to the city centre and back, easy and convenient.
- 5. Modern suburban hotels have become community complexes, as discussed earlier.
- 6. Offer better room rates and facilities for groups, making such properties ideal group hotels for handling volume traffic.
- 7. Many suburban hotels are close to the airport and capture the airline crew, passenger layover and transit stay.

The challenge for housekeeping is to prepare volume rooms by personnel who reside largely in the suburbs.

## Resort Properties

Resort properties are located at natural and man-made sites. Resort hotels will be found at hill stations, seaside resorts, ski resorts,  canyons,  waterfalls,  etc.  Niagara  Falls,  St.  Moritz  ski resort, Miami Beach resort, Safari park and the Grand Canyon are  some good examples of resorts around natural resources. Disney Land, Lego Land, Universal Studios in Hollywood and dam reservoirs are good examples of man-made marvels. His-

<!-- image -->

torical monuments like the Taj Mahal in India, Pyramids of Egypt, etc. are other historical sites for resorts. Their features are:

- 1. Cater specifically to the visitors of those sites.
- 2. Highly seasonal depending upon climates and holidays to get their clientele. Resort properties have to make most of those times and charge well.
- 3. Provide heavy off-season discounts to the budget-conscious traveller.
- 4. Main clientele are families, educational groups and couples.
- 5. Have possibly one all-purpose dining room with meals that depend on local seasonal produce.

Housekeeping will employ a team from the local community during the season. Such personnel may not necessarily be career professionals but part-timers who earn during the season. The rooms may be cleaned once a day with bed linen being changed every alternate day. Often arrivals and departures of transport are fairly predictable as they ply at fixed times, so rooms can be prepared for those timings.

## Airport Hotels

Airport hotels, as the name suggests, are located in the precincts of an airport. Their features are:

- 1. Cater mostly to transient airline passengers who catch another flight to complete their journey and therefore, need a room for a few hours before the next flight.
- 2. Cater also to those passengers with cancelled or delayed flights when the airlines provide hotel facilities.

- 3. Cater additionally to transient airline crews who find the airport hotel convenient between flights.
- 4. Unlikely that these hotels will have gourmet restaurants and entertainment.
- 5. Have large coffee shops to accommodate a full flight of transient passengers and crew.
- 6. May provide an all-purpose drug store and a few emporiums with local arts and crafts for passengers who do not have time for city shopping.
- 7. Have efficient wake-up call services and perhaps a cybercafé.
- 8. Linked to airport air traffic schedules for passengers to check their flight arrival and departure timings.
- 9. Provide a shuttle coach service.
- 10. Have left-luggage facilities for those who have a little more time to visit the city.
- 11. Simple in structure, possibly two floors, with the least frills.

The challenge for housekeeping is the quick turnover of rooms for passengers on short stay.

Airport hotels have three shifts to service airline arrivals and departures throughout day and night, especially at busy airports.

## Motels

Motels are located in principle highways and road junctions. A motel has the following features:

- 1. It is a lodging facility with 15-100 rooms for the automobile traveller.
- 2. Have direct access to their rooms from their car after registering.
- 3. Low buildings, maybe a storey or two high at the most.
- 4. Have ample parking spaces.

<!-- image -->

- 5. Guests can park their cars in front of their rooms.
- 6. The rooms are equipped with tea/coffee kettles, tea/coffee satchels, creamers and sugar for travellers to make their own hot beverages.
- 7. Fitted with a microwave oven for travellers to heat their own food.
- 8. May have a diner and a bar at the most.
- 9. Supplement eating facilities with food and beverage dispensers at convenient spots on the guest floors.
- 10. Earlier motels provided garage facilities to service old model cars.
- 11. Rooms are simple and clean with hot and cold shower or bath facilities.
- 12. Guests stay overnight at the most.

Housekeeping personnel are part-timers from local small towns and provide cleaning services once a day.

## Camps

Camps are located on trekking routes. Modern features are:

- 1. Cater to caravans which are mobile homes.
- 2. Have large parking lots where caravans are parked.
- 3. Each lot has a water-hydrant connection and electricity plug-in point for the caravans.
- 4. Have common toilet and bath facilities with hot and cold water.
- 5. May have an all-purpose diner.

## Types of Hotels

- 6. Guests sleep in their own caravans.
- 7. Earlier camps had plots to pitch tents with common toilet and bath facilities. Food was cooked around a campfire and people trekked on foot.
- 8. Other variations are the forest lodges in remote locations that are fully equipped for self-cooking, bed linen and water supply, though not necessarily hot water.

<!-- image -->

- 9. Payment for the use of the lodge is done at the nearest village office.
- 10. Some lodges may have a caretaker from the local village to meet the needs of the guests.

Housekeeping personnel of tented camps are public cleaners as there are no rooms as such.

## Number of Rooms

Hotels may be classified by the number of rooms they have:

- 25 and less-small

Motels, lodges, bed & breakfast

- 26-100-medium

Family operations promoted with personal wealth

- 101-300-large

Family owned with assistance from financial institutions

- 300-1000-very large

Hotels with public issue

- Above 1000-mega

Hotels with public issue

The size of property depends on the financial strength of the investor. Most motels, lodges, bed and breakfast establishments, etc. come under the small category where individual families and entrepreneurs supplement the tourism effort of the country. More ambitious individual entrepreneurs may establish medium-sized properties as a regular business which must give the investor a return on investment. These properties would still be closely held by families to keep total control on operations and expenditures. The large and mega properties enter a different league where large investments are involved. Housekeeping challenges will vary by size and scope of each size from simple services to complex ones discussed above.

Housekeeping personnel will range from part-time caretakers to professionals.

## Ownership

There are different types of organisations based on their ownership:

- Sole Proprietor
- Partnerships
- Public Limited Companies (PLC)
- Private Limited Companies (Ltd)

## Sole Proprietor

The Sole Proprietor is an individual business person who uses his or her own resources to set up the business. He/she limits the size of operations to the extent of his or her financial limits. Funds come from personal wealth in terms of cash and fixed assets like land, building and jewellery, against which the proprietor gets additional loans from the banks. The funds must cover the cost of land, building, interiors, facilities and operational costs. Naturally, the sole proprietor should have

<!-- image -->

small to medium size properties so that he/she can manage them personally. The sole proprietor is the main architect and promoter of the business based on his or her knowledge and skill. Upon his/her death, the business ceases to exist unless there is a family heir competent enough to take over the reins.

## Partnerships

Partnerships is another method of raising funds. Partnerships help businessmen in aspiring to establish medium to large hotels. Partnership Act of UK (1890) states that 'A partnership is the relation that subsists between persons carrying on a business in common, with a view of profit.' Partners are limited to 20 persons only. Partnerships can be Limited Companies or Unlimited Companies. In Limited Companies, the shareholders are liable for debts only to the extent of their investment. In Unlimited Companies, the shareholders are liable for all debts of the company.

## Public Limited Companies

Public Limited Companies (PLC) are those companies that finance mega hotels of 1000 rooms and above. Las Vegas is an example of mega project where the number of rooms go as high as 5000. Obviously, no one entrepreneur can finance such a project and will have to raise funds by having several shareholders interested in the project. They issue shares to the public.

## Pricing Plans

Pricing Plans is another way to classify hotels. In each pricing plan, a price is quoted that includes room and food charges.

- European Plan-Room charges only

Downtown hotels

- American Plan-Room + all meals

Resorts, suburban hotels, convention centres

- Modified American-Room + Breakfast Plan + Lunch or dinner

Group hotels

- Continental Plan-Room + Continental Breakfast

Downtown hotels

- Bed & Breakfast-Room + English Breakfast

Bed & Breakfast establishments

Downtown

## Length of Stay

The length of stay is another classification where hotels specially gear themselves to short-term and long-term stay of guests as follows:

- Transient Hotel
- Residential Hotel
- Semi-residential

## Transient Hotels

Transient hotels are the type of accommodation where guests stay for short durations which at the maximum last for a week. Downtown hotels, motels and airport hotels are good examples of transient hotels. Their features are:

- 1. Comfortable and clean rooms with en suite bathrooms with hot and cold water
- 2. In-room tea/coffee facilities
- 3. Coffee Shop or Diner
- 4. Bar
- 5. Room Service (excluding motels)
- 6. Quick check-ins and check-outs
- 7. Laundry service (excluding motels)

## Residential Hotels

Residential hotels are equipped to cater guests on a longer stay. Hotel apartments found in many community hotel complexes, are a good example of this. Their features are:

- 1. Suites consisting of two rooms-one a living area and the other a bedroom.

<!-- image -->

- 2. Fitted with kitchenettes for personal cooking.
- 3. Rooms are cleaned by outsourced housekeeping service.
- 4. Security service with pass keys to enter the building.
- 5. Guests may lease this accommodation for a period of upto a year.
- 6. Convenient for long tenure business executives who do not want the hassle of running a home, and mature students with families on university campuses.

## Suite Hotels

Suite hotels are similar to residential hotels but they are meant for guests on a shorter stay of perhaps six months or less. Its features are:

- 1. Ideal for families who need a temporary accommodation before moving into their permanent abode.
- 2. Suitable for travelling professionals who find it convenient to set up travelling offices in their living area without intruding into the bedroom.
- 3. Have all the facilities and amenities of the residential hotel except that they may have a coffee shop bar and perhaps one more specialty restaurant.

Most lodging investors nowadays are opting for Suite Hotels.

- 10. Ideal for single professionals who do not want the hassle of running a home.

## Facilities Offered

The facilities offered by hotels are another way to classify them:

- Star Rating
- Deluxe Hotels
- Palace Hotels
- Convention Hotels
- Conference Hotels
- Casino Hotels
- Business Hotels

<!-- image -->

- Sports Hostels and Hotels
- Budget Hotels
- Suite Hotels
- Bed & Breakfast

## Star Rating

Star Rating is one of the most definitive standards which guides travellers as to what to expect in a hotel (see Annexure 1 for greater details). The star ratings are organised by the State Tourism Department who puts together a team of representatives from the government, hospitality educationists, travel agents, airlines and the hotel industry. They are guided by a checklist of minimum requirements to award a certain star rating. The owner of the property informs the Tourism Department of the star rating he wants for his hotel and sets a date for the inspection. Star Ratings range from one to five-star though there are even six and seven stars which are outside the purview of this lesson as these properties are rare. A five-star rating, for instance, will have the following features:

- 1. Rooms of certain minimum dimensions with attached bathrooms supplying hot and cold water.
- 2. Bathrooms with bathtubs.
- 3. Shopping arcade with a bank, post office, travel agency and so on.
- 4. A coffee shop and other dining options.
- 5. Swimming pool and gymnasium.
- 6. Room service.

From those high standards of investment, the hotel rating reduces as hotels provide lesser facilities. Hotels are required to display their star rating at the main portal of the hotel so that a guest can know what standard to expect.

## Deluxe Hotels

Deluxe Hotels normally have a minimum of five-star rating. These hotels are rated as deluxe as they have décor and appointments of luxury. They have every conceivable comfort built into the guest experience. Take Burj-al-Arab in Dubai where accommodations are suites that overlook the Persian Gulf. The rooms are fitted with remote control window shades, gold-plated taps, etc. Guests are transported to the hotel from the airport by the hotel helicopter that lands on a helipad on the hotel rooftop. It has a restaurant under the sea as well as one at the roof top that gives breathtaking aerial views. Deluxe hotels ooze opulence and are available only to those people who can afford the stay. Some deluxe business hotels provide individual butlers and specialised cuisines. Many older, stand alone hotels like the Grosvner House, The Claridges, etc. set standards of luxury. Many palaces, mansions and villas of the royalty of yore have been converted into hotels, which really cannot be given a star rating because of their uniqueness. Both can certainly be classified as deluxe.

## Palace Hotels

Palace Hotels are really an Indian concept where ancient Indian maharajas converted their palaces into hotels after they were stripped off their princely privileges. The palaces transport guests into old heritage, architecture and priceless appointments. The Umaid Bhavan Palace in Jodhpur, for

## Types of Hotels

example, boasts of a crystal fountain in the lobby and an array of vintage cars in the private garage complex. The beds on which the guests sleep are the ones where actual royalty once slept. Of course these palaces have been equipped with modern conveniences such as television, mini-fridges, air-conditioning and telephone connections though they introduce into the original uniqueness of the property. Guests are exposed to rare art and artifacts that are not found anywhere else in the world. A similar concept may be found in Europe where manor houses

<!-- image -->

of the royalty have been converted into luxury accommodations.

## Conference Hotels

Conference Hotels have similar facilities as convention hotels (mentioned earlier) but scaled down in size. Many hotels may have conference centre attached to their main hotel to have the flexibility for business, tourist and conference business. The conference annexes have independent entrances and large parking lots. Some conference hotels may also include auditoriums that are leased out for public shows.

## Casino Hotels

Casino Hotels serve only one purpose -to serve guests who want to  gamble.  Las Vegas  in  Nevada,  USA  is  the  best  example  of  the location of casino hotels, each one more dramatic than the other. The essential features of casino hotels are gaming halls sometimes the size of a football field with all possible gambling games including banks of slot machines, blackjack tables, roulettes tables, etc. Every hotel

<!-- image -->

outdoes each other in terms of features and entertainment. New York, New York boasts of a lobby that represents a New York street with street cafes, steam from sewers, street lamps leading to the gambling floor; MGM boasts of a sunken bar on the style of the Brazilian rainforest. Treasure Island has a sound and light show of a sinking pirate ship while Bellagios has dancing fountains that offer a unique sight; Caesar's Palace has all its staff dressed in Roman togas and boasts of amphitheatres where famous modern day stars perform; The Bar is a Roman galleon built in the lobby itself. With funds to create and maintain such set ups, casino hotels are truly deluxe with the best facilities to meet every guest need. Most rooms are large and fitted with twin queen-sized beds with bathrooms that have separate bathing, shower and toilet areas. A bathroom would perhaps be the size of a guest room in a smaller property !

## Business Hotels

Business hotels have specifically built-in structure and facilities to cater to the business and corporate clients. We have already discussed these types of hotels in detail earlier in this chapter.

## Sports Hostels and Hotels

Sports Hostels and Hotels may go back to the time of the Olympic Games in 776 B.C. at the height of the Greek empire.  The games started in Olympia about 18 kilometres from Pirgos, Greece.

<!-- image -->

While Olympia was devastated by earthquakes and floods, later excavations showed that the complex had a wrestling and boxing school, gymnasium and dormitories for athletes to stay. Olympic Games were held every four years later and split into the Winter Olympics (in 1994) and Summer Olympics.  Nowadays, sport has become an industry that earns mega bucks from television rights, sponsorships and large gate money. Games like soccer, basketball, cricket, rugby, tennis, football, etc. have become multi-million dollar industries pulling huge crowds. The investment in events like World Cups and championships has now become a lucrative proposition.

## Sports Hostels

Sports hostels are found in games villages which are set up for major championships or Olympic games. The games villages carefully segregate national teams. They have independent gymnasiums, practice fields and large dining halls to provide different cuisines. The games villages have special security, medical rooms, dope-testing facilities, media centres, sports equipment maintenance centres, boutiques for sportswear and other administrative features. Purpose-built sports hostels and hotels are built at popular stadiums to accommodate athletes and spectators of the sport. Essential features of these accommodations are:

- 1. Dormitory style accommodation with single rooms for sports officials
- 2. Gymnasiums
- 3. Health clubs
- 4. Swimming pools
- 5. Large dining halls
- 6. Doctors specialised in sports medicine
- 7. Special security to protect rampaging fans reaching their sports idols
- 8. Dieticians for special diets for sportsmen and sportswomen
- 9. Trainers

## Budget Hotels

Budget hotels are relatively a new concept that makes travel inexpensive in a world that is getting more and more costly. Budget hotels strip rooms and services to the bare minimum and use automation to fulfil many guest needs. Typical features are:

- 1. Air-conditioned rooms with cupboards and mini-bars
- 2. An ensuite bathroom with shower tray and hot and cold water
- 3. A dining room with buffet
- 4. A wall-mounted mini-television
- 5. Common floor pantries with dispensers for hot and cold food, ice, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, toiletries, etc.

## Bed and Breakfast

Bed and Breakfast  establishments  are  usually  small  family businesses. A family may have an extra set of rooms in their home that they let out to tourists. This is a typical concept from Europe which perhaps earlier did not have well-developed hotel facilities.  Ireland  and  Scotland,  for  example,  supplement  hotel

<!-- image -->

## Types of Hotels

<!-- image -->

accommodation in the huge tourist season with bed and breakfast properties. The family of the establishment takes the responsibility of providing comfortable rooms much on the home style with their dining rooms serving as the breakfast venue. Breakfasts are sumptuous English Breakfasts with a full array of cereals, meats, breads and tea and coffee. These breakfasts are legendary for many travellers who can sustain a full day with this meal.

## Time-share Hotels

Time-share Hotels is a relatively new concept of ownership of holiday rooms or suites. Each room or suite is owned by several people who schedule their visit well in advance with the management

office to ensure that the room or suite is available. Time-share properties are located at dream sites, normally at beaches, ski slopes, hill resorts, waterfalls, spas, etc. People book time from a week to a fortnight. If they are not free to avail the room for any reason, they can rent their time slot to  another  person.  Sometimes,  the  management company can help in this process. One great advantage is that time-share owners can become members of international time-share properties and exchange their time with another time-share owner at another location. Time-share properties have fully-furnished rooms with kitchenettes. They may have a dining hall with a bar. They outsource recreation expertise such as guides, boatmen, ski instructors, paragliding specialists, etc.

<!-- image -->

## Condominiums

Condominiums (or Condos) are another type of accommodation. Here the owner of a unit which is a room or an apartment in a complex of several such accommodations furnishes it to his/her taste and informs the management of the times he/she will occupy the apartment. He/she permits the management to rent out the apartment at other times and the rent goes to the owner. Condos have restricted entry. Owners have their own password for entering into the premises. These passwords are given to lessees of their property. Owners pay a monthly or annual maintenance fee that covers cleaning of common areas; central air-conditioning/heating maintenance; landscaping and gardening; water supply; security and garbage disposal. Condo management, which is appointed by the owner's association, may lease space to a grocery store in the basement to provide the items of basic needs to the residents of condos.

## Other Lodging Concepts

In addition to traditional hotels, there are other lodging options to a traveller, which include concepts unique to a country and other unique concepts. Let us take a look at these:

- Ecotel
- Bedsit
- Boarding House
- Caravan
- Chalet
- Floating Hotel

- Government House
- Hospices
- Hostels
- Ice Hotel
- Log Cabin
- Matel
- Rotel
- Sanatoria
- Tree House

## Ecotels

Ecotels are a relatively new concept of properties that give respect to the natural environment and provide carbon-efficient construction and operations. These are environment-friendly hotels.

It  is  believed  that  by  the  year  2050,  residential,  commercial  and  institutional  buildings  will consume as much as 38% of the global energy production by releasing 3,800 megatons of carbon into the atmosphere. This and other similar concerns have led to the emergence of green buildings and green operations concept.

Green buildings cut down on carbon emission. A green building has the following aspects:

- Commitment to energy-conscious architecture
- Eco-friendly designs
- People's participation in the planning and maintenance of the building
- Operations with strong infrastructural thrust on minimum energy use

Green buildings use shaded facades (especially glass), light colours and insulation to make it energy efficient. Research is still ongoing regarding low-energy architecture, hybrid air-conditioning, autonomous energy and water systems, earth construction and community-based design of common property. Green buildings make use of natural lighting and ventilation to maintain a balance between temperature, humidity and oxygen levels.

The US Green Building Council started the green building movement by creating the Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) rating system. This system encourages efforts towards making buildings clean and energy efficient by implementing steps that will improve the structure's operational efficiency. It focuses on energy and atmosphere, water, green material, education and innovation. In India, the CII-Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre in Hyderabad set the trend and became the model for the construction industry by being the only building in the world to be awarded the 'platinum rating' under this rating system. It was able to save 60% energy and 30% water bills compared to conventional buildings. Since then, the ITC Green Centre has won the Platinum Award and the Grundfos Building in Chennai has won the Gold Award.  A LEED-rated building can prevent 12,000-15,000 tons of carbon per year. Other global-certified bodies are Ecotel, ISO 14001 and Green Globe.

In India, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) joined hands with the World Business Council for sustainable development to form energy efficiency in buildings. TERI developed the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) rating system to address Indian buildings and environmental conditions. As per this system, the environmental performance of a building over its entire life cycle is evaluated, thereby creating a definitive standard for certifying it as a green building.

## Types of Hotels

The benefits of green buildings are:

- Reduced energy consumption without sacrificing the comfort levels
- Minimised destruction of natural areas, habitats and biodiversity and reduced soil loss from erosion
- Decreased air and water pollution with direct health benefits
- Reduced water consumption
- Limited waste generation due to recycling and reuse
- Reduced pollution loads
- Increased productivity
- Enhanced image and marketability

Coming to hotels, there are 36 green-certified hotels worldwide, of which five are in India. ITC Sonar Bangla in Kolkata became the first Indian hotel to be successful in implementing this concept. Lemon Tree in Chennai and Uppal's Orchid in Gurgaon are other shining examples. Apart from the architecture, the operational features and practices of such hotels also bring about energy savings. Some of these are:

- Using medium-density woods in construction
- A green button in rooms to stabilise temperatures
- Energy-saving light bulbs (up to 40%)
- Furniture of steel and glass
- 'Request for Fruits' card and no fruit platters
- Water not filled to the brim
- Fresh flowers replaced by object d'art
- Sewage treatment plants to reuse waste water for horticulture
- Providing guest supplies from recycled material
- Aerated water in taps where air is injected to provide bulk
- Not using chemicals and chlorine in water
- Reusable jute bags for laundry
- Jute bath slippers
- Using chefs' caps made from reusable material
- Use of jute mats as throw rugs in rooms
- Avoiding the use of polythene
- Changing bed linen once in two days instead of everyday
- Replacing towels on request
- Offering organic foods
- Reuse of food material to create compost
- Sending used oil in the kitchens to soap factories
- Sending old flowers to those agencies that extract colours from flowers for the textile industry

A successful marketing point of Ecotels is to receive accreditation and certification. Ecotels realise that such initiatives not only give them a marketing advantage but also help in maintaining the  bottom line.  Certification  bodies  offer  guiding  principles  that  Ecotels  have  to  adopt  to  be considered as such. Such certification bodies are Ecotel, LEED, ISO14001 and Green Globe. In India, we have GRIHA under TERI.

Ecotels can earn carbon credits. For example, ITC Sonar Bangla earned 1886 tons of Carbon Emission Reductions (CERs) in 2006, which earned them Rs. 14,71,760. Green Buying is another

<!-- image -->

new concept adopted by Ecotels. It refers to the purchase of those products which have a minimal side effect on the environment, and to abandon the use of environmentally unsafe processes anywhere in the supply chain.

## Bedsit

Bedsit or flatlette (in Austria) is a single flat equipped with a bed and a small kitchen with an electric kettle and an electric stove. It has a shared toilet down the common corridor. Bedsits were created from larger dwellings in England as alternatives to those looking for independent set-ups from traditional boarding houses with communal dining. It is affordable and ideal for tourists who want a simple independent house when on a long vacation.

## Boarding House

Boarding house is also known as 'rooming house' in the US. It is used by people who are on vacation for one or more days. In a boarding house, boarders share washing and cooking. It is found in resorts and college towns. In the UK, boarding houses are typically run by landladies who provide bed and breakfast, half-board (breakfast and dinner) and full-board (breakfast, lunch and dinner). Boarding houses are especially suitable for families on holiday and are available on low budgets. The bed and breakfast is a form of boarding house usually run by families.

## Caravans

Caravans are mobile homes that people take across the country. Caravans are fitted with sleeping, dining, lounge and bathroom facilities. They have tanks with fresh water and septic tanks for refuse. Some caravans have kitchenettes with basic heating facilities. As discussed earlier, caravans are moored at camping sites constructed for this purpose.

## Chalets

Chalets are vacation homes unique to Switzerland. They are typically small homes that travellers can rent and run as though it were their own house. They give the freedom to adopt whatever lifestyle the vacationer wishes. Chalets were the mainstay for travellers during the 18th century but have now been adopted in many other countries. Holiday cottages in the UK dot the countryside.

## Floating Hotels

Floating hotels are those found on passenger ships. Some are permanently docked at a port while others are cruise liners taking passengers on a week-long trip around famed locations connected with water. The ships are five star hotels with every conceivable luxury, including several multicuisine restaurants, suites, ball rooms, shopping arcades, and so on. Guests are served by well-trained and talented personnel. A wonderful variation of this concept is the houseboats of Kashmir. Houseboats are moored on the banks of the lakes and fitted with telephone connections, modern sanitation in bathrooms and the most luxurious appointments and décor. The roof acts as the sun deck while the boat has a living room, a dining room and several bedrooms. The houseboat is staffed by the owner and his family, who cooks, cleans and runs small errands. Shikaras are smaller boats that sidle along the boat for transportation around the lake. Hawkers come alongside the houseboats

## Types of Hotels

<!-- image -->

in their shikaras (open or covered row boats) to sell their wares. Houseboats are fitted to suit all budgets from the economical to the ultra-luxurious.

## Government Houses

Government houses are a composite name for Dak Bungalows, Circuit Houses, PWD Houses and Forest Lodges which were the legacy of the British Raj in India. These were primarily built for government officials during the administrative tours. Dak Bungalows were for the postal couriers to rest while circuit houses were for the higher-ranked officials. Forest Lodges were built for those involved in forestry and building the winter capitals of the Raj.  The PWD Houses were for those officials involved in road building and laying electricity power lines. These establishments have caretakers drawn from local villages who are multi-skilled to cook, clean and provide security to the establishment. They are trained to give the standards required by the officials and are very capable. These establishments are still available to government personnel and authorised public.

## Hospices

Hospices have been traditional church lodgings in Europe for the Christian pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem. Each religion has its religious support groups running on charity. For example, the Hokke Club of Japan is specially designed for the Buddhist pilgrims. It provides meditation centres for prayers. Followers of Islam provide madrassas while Hindus have their dharmshalas for the pilgrims of their faith. Another variation is the choultry , which is of Indian origin and refers to simple accommodation run by charitable institutions at nominal rates.

## Hostels

Hostels are a type of accommodation where guests can rent a bed (sometimes a bunk bed) in a dormitory. Residents share common bathrooms, kitchen and lounge rooms. They can be co-ed, all male or all female. Private rooms are becoming increasingly common in all types of hostels. They are cheaper for both the host as well as the guest. For travellers, the main benefit is its low cost compared to hotels. Travellers also get a chance to interact more with other travellers and make new friends, especially in foreign environments. They are frequented by young travellers between 18-26 years of age giving sprout to youth hostels like the YMCA or YWCA. Hostels can be independent or part of a licensed authority and ideal for backpackers. Hostels today offer dormitories and en-suite single-occupancy accommodation.

## Ice Hotels

Ice hotels are temporary hotels made up entirely of snow and sculpted blocks of ice which one may consider as novelty architecture. They are for those who are interested in novelties and unusual environments. Their lobbies are decorated with ice sculptures while food and beverages reflect the environment and local produce. These hotels are reconstructed each year. The ice hotel near the village of Jukkasjarvi, Kiruna in Sweden is the first and most famous ice hotel. The hotel has 80

20

rooms and suites, a bar, reception area and a church. The ice hotel in Canada near Quebec City is the first in North America. It has 85 rooms with ice beds lined with deer furs and covered with mattresses and arctic sleeping bags. The Mammut Snow Hotel in Finland is made of snow with ice sculptures as decoration.  The Alta Igloo ice hotel in Norway is built yearly since 2000 and has 30 rooms with unique lighting systems that highlight the crystalline formations. In 2006, the first ice hotel was built in Eastern Europe at Balea Lake, Romania.

## Log Cabins

Log cabins are found at remote locations, especially in mountains that are fully equipped for selfcooking, bed linen and water supply, though not necessarily hot water! Payment for the use of the lodge is done at the nearest village office. Some lodges may have a caretaker from the local village to meet the needs of the guests. Log cabins are called Biwakschachtel in Germany. These are usually located in the Alps and are maintained by Alpine clubs.

Another version is the Bothy found in England, Wales and Scotland. It is a simple shelter left unlocked and available to anyone to use without charge. Most bothies are former ruined buildings that have been restored to a basic standard providing a windproof and watertight shelter. They vary in size from little more than a large box to a two-storied cottage. Bedding is not provided but have candles and firewood to keep warm. However, there is no option to cook. These facilities  are  accessible  to  foot-trekkers  and  bicyclists. Bothies are usually located near a natural water source and may or may not have a bathroom.

<!-- image -->

## Matels

Matels are fully-automated hotels which require minimum human contact. A guest can book it online and gets an immediate confirmation. On arrival, he punches in his reservation number and name in a machine which initiates a dialogue with a virtual receptionist who registers the guest through a close circuit TV and issues a key to the room through a slot machine. Outsourced cleaning crews come during the day to clean the room and make it fresh and impeccably clean. This concept was started in Japan and is likely to be the future of hotels.

## Palace on Wheels

Palace on Wheels is a unique railway journey recreating the journeys of the maharajas of India. It is a tour from New Delhi, India, to the historic sights in Rajasthan and covers forts, palaces and cultural attractions. The guests are served traditional Indian food by liveried waiting staff.

## Rotels

Rotels are double-decker buses where passengers sit on ergo-planned seats on the ground floor and sleep on the second. Such buses are used for long cross-country tours covering fifteen days or more. The second floor has tiered berths fitted with bedside lamps, toilet shelf and privacy curtains. Buses are fitted with bathrooms much like those found in an aeroplane and kitchens with a chef to cook

## Types of Hotels

their foods. The buses are fitted with heating and/or air-conditioning facility. Buses stop at vantage points en route for meals and hotel accommodation for a hot bath. The greatest benefit of such travel is that guests do not have the hassle of packing and unpacking. They are provided with cupboards on board. Rotels were introduced by Conti Hotel Bus Company of Germany.

## Sanatoria

Sanatoria are found at spas and other health resorts. The rooms are specifically equipped for therapy, including sauna, Turkish bath and Jacuzzi. Meals are personalised diet regimes for each guest. These hotels have proper dieticians, doctors and medical arrangements. This is ideal for those recouping from surgeries and illnesses. It is also a place for attaining physical fitness.

## Tree Houses

Tree houses are small houses built among branches of mature trees. Such accommodation is found in safari parks as protection from scavengers. It is an eco-friendly facility that merges with the environment and is least polluting to its surrounding areas. Although traditionally built of wood, experimentation with technologies (especially fabrics) now have produced viable living structures more like tree tents. These are ideal for those adventurous tourists who can be in the middle of a jungle yet be safe. A famous tree house hotel is the Treetops Hotel in the Aberdare National Park, Kenya, which was opened in 1932 and was rebuilt in 1944.

## Hotel Chain Associations

she can respond to their unique features when working for them as a housekeeping professional.

## INTRODUCTION

It is important for a professional housekeeper to understand hotel chain associations, as they could well be employed by these chains. A hotel chain has several hotels under the same brand name, located at different geographic locations both domestically and internationally. Some of these hotels are owned by the chain and the others are franchised operations with independent owners. Some famous hotel chains are: Sheraton, Intercontinental, Ramada, Best Westin, Holidays Inn, Howard Johnson, etc. A brand is a patented name that has unique products and services associated with the name . The benefit is that a traveller can expect basic international standards of products and services when they check into a branded hotel anywhere in the world. The typical features of a hotel chain would be:

- 1. An international brand name of quality
- 2. A unique culture and work ethos of the principals
- 3. International standards of hotel products and services
- 4. Set systems and procedures of the principals
- 5. Standardised products and services
- 6. Procedural manuals for each aspect of operations
- 7. Strong professional support services like engineering, training, facility planning, central purchasing, etc.
- 8. Global reservation networks
- 9. International management services
- 10. Synergy of other hotels in the chain. (Each hotel becomes an active 'salesperson' in that location.)
- 11. International marketing
- 12. International cuisines

- 13. Professional training to international standards
- 14. Multilingual staff

While domestic chains operate within a country, international chains operate in all the continents. Individual hotels cannot avoid being absorbed in this multidimensional, multinational operation which provides expertise, technology, and marketing thrust that they cannot do individually.

## HISTORY OF CHAIN OPERATIONS

In  1925, Howard Johnson ,  a  soda  pop  restaurateur,  created  the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge in Savannah, Georgia, that expanded into the first chain operation domestically and later internationally.

Another famous hotelier, Willard Marriott ,  started  as  a  restaurateur  with A&W  fast  food restaurant chain in 1928. He entered into the hotel industry in 1940s and expanded it into a $5.3 billion Marriott Corporation with segmented hotel chains such as Marriott Hotels, Residence Inns and Courtyard Hotels.

In the late 1950s, another new concept emerged-budget hotels. Budget hotels bought cheap land and offered lodging only. They stripped all services like food and beverage, laundry, housekeeping, uniformed services to be able to offer a cheap rate to the travellers. The rooms had no televisions and telephones. Guests sometimes had to rent the bed, linen and blankets for their rooms. The first budget hotel was the Travelodge , Tacoma Washington that grew into a successful chain throughout North America. Travelodge now has added amenities such as TV and telephones and bed linen as essential to stay in the business.

Many other corporations have also spawned into international chains offering the following associations with individual owners:

## Types of Chain Associations

- (a) Partnership -Sharing equity and profits
- (b) Franchise -Providing name and association against a fee
- (c) Management Contract -Providing professional managers, technicians, manuals, systems, etc. against management fees and a share of profits as incentive payment

In most of the cases, the sub-staff are all hired locally to save labour cost. They are trained according to the standards of the chain. The Executive Housekeeper can be an employee of the chain or a local hire with the privilege of consulting chain housekeeping specialists. Let us look at each of these associations in detail.

## Partnership

A partnership occurs when a chain and an independent investor jointly finance a hotel project. The features of a partnership are:

- 1. Both the partners become owners of the property.
- 2. They bring to the table their individual expertise and talents.
- 3. They share in the profits and liabilities on an equal basis.

Another arrangement that is popular nowadays is the straight lease agreement. A hotel chain reviews a property built by an investor who then leases the property to the chain on an annual lease basis. The owner becomes a landlord and does not interfere in the operations of the property. The chain

26

becomes the tenant and is responsible for all taxes and recurring municipal fees which are paid from the operations.

Another arrangement is the sale of a property by a chain which leases it back from the new owner under a lease basis, management contract or franchise arrangement. Chains opt for this when they want capital funds for other projects or when they want to reduce direct investment as a strategy.

The professional housekeeper has to understand the involvement of each hotel owner, especially the one accountable for day-to-day operations. The General Manager provides such clarifications. It is also important to know the systems, procedures and standards adopted by the hotel. Often the Executive Housekeeper on the rolls of the principal has to convince the owners of the hotel on the best housekeeping practices and budgets required for operation.

## Franchise

A franchise is a licence given by a franchiser (in this case the chain) to a franchisee who can be an individual, partner, a small corporation or a group of investors.

## Why does an independent owner take on a franchise?

- 1. To get a worldwide brand name of consistent quality.
- 2. To generate large revenues through referral business. Each hotel in a chain becomes salesperson for other franchisees.
- 3. To have access to their central reservation system to get worldwide reach.
- 4. To get professional expertise and support services.

## Why does a chain give a franchise?

- 1. It is the fastest way to expand overseas.
- 2. Direct investments in hotels are high for any hotel chain corporation to finance.
- 3. A new franchisee becomes a salesperson in a location for other franchised properties of the chain.
- 4. Franchise fees demanded by the franchiser from the franchisee generates substantial revenue without direct investments.

The housekeeping professional in a franchised property must be trained in the systems and procedures of the principals. They are specially required to understand and execute the set minimum standards. Such guidelines come in the form of procedural manuals which state the way in which things should be done in the housekeeping department including the job titles used for various positions.  There can be no deviations from set procedures which are audited annually by the franchiser, to maintain the promise of international standards .

## Management Contract

A chain and individual hotel owner can enter into a management contract. A management contract is one where the principal appoints professionals of the chain to run the hotel operations. Such professionals would include the General Manager, Food and Beverage Manager, Executive Chef, Executive Housekeeper, and Rooms Division Manager. Sub-staff are hired locally and trained by the chain's corporate trainer. The owner takes this option for the following reasons:

- 1. To get professional expertise not available locally.
- 2. To get international recognition.
- 3. To establish international standards to attract foreign travellers.

## Hotel Chain Associations

<!-- image -->

- 4. The owner becomes the dormant partner in operational matters and only intercedes when expenditures exceed budgets. All operational expenses are borne by the owner.

Under this association, the housekeeping professionals receive guidelines and instructions from the resident representative of the chain, usually the General Manager who is a full-time employee of the hotel seconded by the chain. Housekeepers get technical guidance and training from area housekeepers, regional housekeepers or corporate housekeepers .

## Organisation of a Hotel

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To help the reader understand and appreciate the role of various divisions  and  departments  of  a  hotel  and  their  demands  on housekeeping.

## INTRODUCTION

This  lesson  helps  housekeeping  professionals  appreciate  the  role  of  various  divisions  and departments of a hotel and their contributions to operations.  They will especially learn their needs from the Housekeeping Department. For example, most departments rely on the Public Area section of the Housekeeping Department for their cleaning requirements. First, let us see how a hotel is organisationally structured.

## LARGE HOTEL ORGANISATION STRUCTURE

First let us understand some terms:

- 1. Organisation Structure: A  framework  that  assigns  responsibilities  and  channels  of communications
- 2. Organisation Chart: A  schematic  depiction  of relationships between jobs
- 3. A Division: A grouping of related departments
- 4. Department: An independent activity that contributes to business

The Housekeeping Department is clubbed under the Accommodations Division.  There are essentially two major divisions: Accommodations and Food and Beverage , both supported by Staff Departments.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Accommodations Division

This division has a set of departments responsible for the sale of rooms. These departments are:

- Front Office

Includes reception, concierge, lobby services, transport, business centre, guest relations, and telecommunications

- Engineering

Includes  electrical,  civil,  carpentry,  mechanical,  electronic, plumbing and fire-prevention activities

- Housekeeping

Cleaning, maintenance and aesthetic upkeep, horticulture and florist

- Laundry

Guest and in-house laundry

- Health Club

Includes gymnasium, swimming pool, yoga, aerobics, saunas

- Recreation

Water sports, racket sports

- Business Centre

Equipped offices with support executive services

## Food and Beverage Division

The Food and Beverage Division has a set of departments responsible for the sale of food and beverage. These departments are:

- Restaurants

Coffee shop, specialty restaurant, grill room, night club, etc.

- Kitchens

Includes central and satellite kitchens

- Kitchen Stewarding

Kitchen cleaning, dish washing, pot washing

- Bars

Central bars and dispense bars

- Room Service

Food and beverage service to guest rooms and offices

- Banquets

Indoor and outdoor catering for functions and meetings

- Delicatessen

Shop that sells forced meats

- Pastry Shop

Sells confectionaries

- Bakery Shop

Sells assorted breads, pies and muffins

## Staff Departments

Staff departments are non-revenue departments that create and support sales.

- Human Resources

Recruitment, orientation, training, and compensation

- Sales and Marketing

Advertising, promotion, marketing and selling

- Finance and Accounting

Financial management, accounting, F&B controls, purchasing, receiving, storing, MIS and audit

- Information Technology

Installation of hardware, software, mainframe servers, cabling, networking and troubleshooting

- Security

Guest, employee and hotel security, fire prevention and fire fighting

The organisation structure then puts these divisions and departments into a relationship of communication and responsibility given in the management organisation chart overleaf in Fig. 3.1. It is representative only, and can be modified according to the objectives and policies of each hotel.

## SMALL HOTEL ORGANISATION STRUCTURE

Smaller hotels have similar functions as larger hotels, executed by fewer people with multiple skills. For example:

- 1. The General Manager takes on the roles of human resources manager and sales manager in addition to the operations responsibilities.
- 2. The Front Office Supervisor oversees the front desk operations as well as lobby activities.
- 3. The Dining Room Supervisor oversees the dining room operations and bar. Small operations would have limited restaurant options, possibly only a dining room that serves at all meal times. It is possible that the dining room has a dispensing bar to provide drinks eliminating the need for a formal bar.
- 4. The Housekeeper takes on the roles of the floor supervisors or the housekeeping control desk supervisor.
- 5. The Accountant takes over the income and payable responsibilities in addition to producing the statutory requirements such as Profit and Loss Statements and Balance Sheets.
- 6. The Purchase Clerk also performs the receiving and store functions. Though this is strictly not ideal in terms of food and beverage control, the operations are small enough for direct supervision and control of the General Manager.
- 7. The Food and Beverage Cost Clerk does all the costing functions.
- 8. The Engineering Supervisor is multiskilled to troubleshoot engineering problems. However, any operation requires specialists like air-conditioning and heating mechanics and plumbers.
- 9. Most other services such as laundry, horticulture, civil works, etc. are outsourced.

## Organisation of a Hotel

The management organisation chart in Fig. 3.2 shows how the structure of a small hotel is pruned to fit limited payroll budgets. We see that job positions are held by lower-titled positions to keep down the costs of payroll.

Now let us look at each division and department in detail.

## ACCOMMODATIONSDIVISION

## Front Office

The Front Office Department has the following functions:

- To reserve rooms
- To register guests into the hotel
- To provide information to guests during their stay
- To maintain their master bills

Their  prime  responsibility  is  to  sell  rooms achieving  budgeted revenue targets. The principal job positions are:

Front Office Manager: Oversees the front office and lobby. He translates company policies and procedures in practice in the department.

<!-- image -->

Front Office Supervisor: Oversees a shift in twenty-four hour front office operation.

Registration Agent: The person who registers guests into the hotel and allots rooms to them.

Reservation Agent: Makes room reservations and controls the supply of rooms for sale.

Front Office Cashier: Maintains the guest folios (bills) and receives payment when guests check out. He functionally comes under the Accounts Department, but administratively coordinates closely with the front office.

<!-- image -->

## Uniformed Services

The front office is supported by the uniformed services based in the lobby. Their main functions are:

- To provide porter services to handle guest baggage.
- To provide a lobby manager's desk for round-the-clock management contact.

## Types of Rooms

<!-- image -->

To help the reader learn the range of guest rooms that are available in hotels as he/she would be responsible for them as a housekeeping professional.

## INTRODUCTION

A housekeeping professional must be familiar with the rooms and should have knowledge of the rooms of the hotel available for sale. Housekeeping is responsible for cleaning and maintaining guest rooms and so this knowledge is essential for a housekeeping professional. The features in each room determine the  time  and  guest  supplies required to prepare a room for sale. Each hotel has a variety of rooms to meet the needs of guests. A single guest would like to stay in a single room which is  more  cost-effective  for  him,  while  a couple will find a double room more convenient.

<!-- image -->

A family may choose a suite to have more leg room for children to move around. A business executive may want a special suite to entertain privately or show off his financial status to his or her clients. Similarly, budget groups may be willing to share twin rooms, while upmarket groups may prefer single rooms. Guest needs are endless and their motives for booking a type of room may be varied.

## SIGNIFICANCE OF ROOMS

The sale of rooms contributes approximately 50 per cent or more to the total hotel revenue. In some lodging establishments, it could be the only source of revenue. A room 'sale' occurs when a

<!-- image -->

room is leased for occupation for 24 hours, at a predetermined cost. A room not sold on a particular day loses its opportunity to earn revenue for that day. Hence, rooms are referred to as 'perishable' commodities. The loss of sale can also result from the inefficiency of the housekeeping department to have a room ready when required.  What does a room mean to a guest?

- 1. It means comfort: Hotel investors translate comfort in the following manner:
- Quality beds and mattresses
- Temperature control
- T.V. Entertainment
- Hot and cold water
- Attached bathrooms
- Soft linen

It  is  the  responsibility  of  housekeeping  to  ensure  that  these  comforts  must  be  regularly maintained and in functioning order.

- 2. It means security: This need is translated in the following manner:
- A single door for entry and exit
- Double locks from inside
- Peep-holes
- Door chains
- Concealed electrical wires
- Secure connection of room equipment
- Fire detection system and sprinklers provide immediate response to a fire emergency
- Fire exit route plan behind the room door in case of an emergency
- Security personnel patrolling floors
- Entry into rooms by authorised personnel only

Housekeeping personnel should remain alert to unknown guests on a floor and contact the security in case of suspicion.

- 3. It means privacy: Privacy is provided by the following:
- Guest room windows are provided with curtains or blinds.
- Superior hotels have daylight sheer curtains and heavy curtains for the night.
- The Telephone Department and the Front Office are instructed to protect information of room numbers and guests staying in them from the external public.
- Authorised personnel that wish to enter a room have to announce themselves.

Housekeeping staff is trained to knock the door announcing themselves twice before entering the room.

- 4. It means convenience: A guest is provided with entertainment, food and beverage services, telephone services, etc. in the room. The housekeeping department provides the guest a house directory to access such conveniences.
- 5. It means cleanliness and hygiene: A room is the most personal area of a guest during his/ her stay. The room must be clean and the bathroom made hygienic for the guest's stay. This is a major factor that makes the guest to return. Housekeeping is responsible to clean and maintain all guest rooms.
- 6. A 'Home Away from Home': A hotel room provides a residence and address when a guest is travelling. They expect all the comfort and security of a home and are willing to pay for it.

## ORGANISATION OF HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Layout of the Housekeeping Department

<!-- image -->

To familiarise the reader with a typical layout of the Housekeeping of the department.

## INTRODUCTION

There is no ideal or universal model for the layout of a housekeeping department. The layout differs in hotels based upon the size and the limitations of physical space. However, the layouts must respond to certain considerations:

- The number of guest rooms determines the space required to maintain inventories of room linen and supplies.
- The number of function rooms determines the amount of linen to be maintained.
- The number of public area facilities and the anticipated volume of business determine the amount of restaurant linen to be maintained.
- Whether the hotel decided to outsource some services like landscaping, flower arrangements, tailoring, upholstery, laundry, etc. to be able to optimally utilise space.
- The number of total employees for the amount of uniform inventories that have to be maintained.

Hotel space is valuable and used mostly to generate revenue. An investor makes decisions whether to allot  space  to  revenue-generating  activities  or  to  non-revenue  activities  such  as housekeeping. The investor allocates unattractive  locations  in  the  building  for  non-revenue

Figure 5.1 gives the layout of a Housekeeping Department. It is representative only. It portrays the basic facilities required by the Housekeeping Department.

<!-- image -->

activities. It is for this reason that the housekeeping department is located in the basement termed as 'backhouse' areas.

## HOUSEKEEPING DESIGN FACTORS

There are a few considerations to be kept in mind when planning housekeeping facilities:

- (a) It  must  be  accessible  to  all  employees  of  the  hotel  as  they  visit  the  uniform  room  for exchanging uniforms. Food and beverage personnel and floor supervisors visit the linen room for exchanging linen.
- (b) The location must be away from guest view and traffic.
- (c) The floors must be strong for heavy equipment such as laundry machines.
- (d) The sound and vibration of equipment should not disturb guests.
- (e) Effective climate control is necessary. Extreme temperatures ruin textiles and equipment.
- (f) Housekeeping corridors must be spacious for mobile equipment and staff traffic, especially at exchange counters of the uniform and linen rooms.
- (g) Adequate storage to stock volumes of linen, uniforms, cleaning detergents, operational equipment, lost and found items, toxic chemicals, etc.
- (h) Utilities such as power, fuel, water and steam connections are required for housekeeping and laundry equipment. The utility connections should be easily accessible and concealed for safety.
- (i) The facility design must be so that it is easy to keep the facility safe and sanitised. Cleaning crews must have access to every corner of the facility especially under heavy equipment.
- (j) The layout should match the type of building construction. Skyscrapers, for instance, require efficient service elevators while chalet-type resort properties may require sturdy access roads to roll trolleys and carts.
- (k) Distribution points for linen may vary. Busy hotels may have floor pantries, while chalet-type resort properties may need service huts to serve a given number of chalets.
- (l) Physical fatigue is caused by too much movement, lack of climate control and carrying heavy loads. The physical layout should take productivity of staff into account while planning the facility.
- (m) Lighting must be bright in linen and uniform rooms so that stains and damages can be spotted.
- (n) Every government prescribes safety codes especially where people work. The codes prescribe adequate methods of waste disposal, recycling of materials like bottles, newspapers and cans, sanitation schedules, preventive maintenance schedule, etc.

## LAYOUT AND HOUSEKEEPING FACILITIES

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Housekeeping Layout

Let us look at each housekeeping layout component in detail:

## Housekeeper's Office

Its main features are:

- It is the main administration centre for the department.
- It must be an independent cabin for silence and privacy.
- It is glass-panelled so as to give the Housekeeper a view of what is happening outside her office.
- The office is preceded by a cabin for the secretary who would control movement into the Housekeeper's office.

## Control Desk Room

Its main features are:

- It is the main communication centre where relevant housekeeping information is sent and received.
- It  is  the  nerve centre for co-ordination with the front office, banquets, etc.
- The room has a desk and a chair, preferably more than one telephone, and a computer terminal for information storage and control.
- It should have a large notice board to display essential information for the staff.
- The Desk Control Room is the point where all staff report for duty and check out at the end of duty. It adjoins the Housekeeper's Office.

## Lost and Found Section

Its main features are:

- It is a cupboard in the Control Desk Room to store misplaced guest belongings that may be claimed later.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- It is away from thoroughfare.
- The area is secure, cool, and dry.

This is where current linen is stored for issue and receipt. Its main features are:

- The room is well lit, large and airy, and free from heat and humidity.
- It has adequate shelves to stack linen and secure it from pilferage.
- The linen room has a counter for the exchange of linen.
- The linen room must adjoin the in-house laundry for smooth and speedy exchange of fresh and soiled linen and uniforms.
- It is accessible only to authorised persons.
- It must have only one entry/exit door for security. (See Lesson 17, 'The Linen and the Uniform Rooms' for more details.)

This room stocks the uniforms in current circulation. It is possible that smaller hotels may choose to combine this room with the linen room as shown in Fig. 5.1. The volume of uniforms in circulation determines whether to have an independent uniform room or not. The features of a Uniform Room are:

- Hanging racks as most uniforms are best maintained when hung.
- Shelves for regular hardy uniforms like dungarees, chefs' jackets, etc.
- Cupboards for small accessories like gloves, ties, bows, caps, etc.
- Exchange counter for employees who come to collect and deposit their uniforms.
- Exchange counter with the in-house laundry.
- It has only one entry/exit door for security.

The store stocks materials for linen and uniforms. Ideally, the stock maintained should be enough to replenish once all over the whole hotel. However, due to budgetary constraints the hotel may stock less. Stocks in the store are only touched when the linen or uniforms in circulation fall short due to damage or loss.

The main features of the store are:

- The room should be cool and dry.
- It  is  provided  with  shelves  to  stock  the  linen  and  materials.  Larger  hotels  may  have  an independent store for linen and another for uniforms, based on the volume of materials in circulation and the hotel's policy to stock such large numbers.
- It has only one entry/exit door for security.

This is a store to stock bulky housekeeping equipment like vacuum cleaners, carpet shampoo machines, ladders for chandelier and window cleaning, etc. Its main features are:

- The room should be clean and dry.
- It  is  securely  locked  to  prevent  pilferage  or  theft,  as  they  constitute  substantial  capital investment.
- It has only one entry/exit door for security.

This room is for in-house full-time tailors who stitch and mend damaged linen and uniforms. Its features are:

- The room has sewing machines at machining stations based on the number of tailors employed.
- It has shelves and cupboards to store materials used for uniforms.
- It is accessible only to tailors and uniform room personnel.
- It is a clean and dry place.

Smaller hotels may outsource this function to reliable tailors in the city to save space and recurrent labour costs.

<!-- image -->

This is a space provided to store damaged upholstered furniture. Tailors specialised in re-upholstery work in this yard. Since furniture takes space, it requires adequate space to store them.

Each guest floor has a floor linen room to keep a supply of linen, guest supplies, and cleaning supplies to service the rooms on a floor. Its features are:

- It is the housekeeping nerve centre for the floor.
- It is away from guest view situated at the end of floors or off the foyers of service elevators.
- It maintains a complete turnover of fresh linen to service all rooms on the floor.

To help the reader understand

## INTRODUCTION

Housekeeping responsibilities embrace the entire hotel. Naturally, the largest workforce of the hotel belongs to the Housekeeping Department. Figures 6.1 and 6.2 give the housekeeping organisation charts of a large and small property.

## RESPONSIBILITIES OF HOUSEKEEPING

We observe from the charts that Housekeeping has responsibility of six broad areas.

- 1. The cleaning of guest rooms
- 2. The cleaning of public areas
- 3. The upkeep and exchange of linen and uniforms
- 4. The maintenance of external landscapes and gardens as well as internal flower arrangements
- 5. The management of the laundry
- 6. Communications through the Control Desk

These areas need human resources to carry out the work. Each area needs an expert to fulfil the responsibility of tasks involved. Let us see briefly the responsibilities of each one of them.

## Competencies of a Housekeeping Professional

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To  help  the  reader  understand  the  competencies required for housekeeping professionals so that he/she can incorporate and develop them in his/her personality before entering the hotel industry.

## INTRODUCTION

Competencies are a set of behavioural traits and technical abilities that are suitable for a job. While the new technical abilities are covered extensively in the section of 'Introduction' titled ' The New Housekeeping Professional ' (readers are urged to read it along with this lesson), we shall look at behavioural sets required. Preceding lessons have shown that the housekeeping professional has changed dramatically and is empowered with more responsibilities. To fulfil them, certain behaviour traits are essential to complement knowledge and skills. Recruiters give importance to competencies when hiring housekeeping professionals. Here are few competencies of which some are age old and some new in keeping with the times.

## COMPETENCIES

## Smile!

Many of us may have forgotten how we look when we smile. Many have even forgotten to smile! Yet it is the most enduring competency required of hotel professionals. As simple as it may seem, it is the most effective way of dealing with guests. A smile gets a smile in response. It immediately breaks down barriers of fatigue, low spirits, doubt, anxiety, etc. Recruiters look for this competency at

## Competencies of a Housekeeping Professional

the time of interview. It is recommended that housekeeping professionals smile in front of the mirror and assess their competency in it. Keeping a smile, while speaking on the telephone, is a powerful way to convey tone and intention to guests and colleagues who judge the caller by the voice. We must not forget that housekeeping personnel are in direct contact with guests in guest rooms, on the floor and in public areas. While care is taken to be as unobtrusive to guests as possible, contact with them is inevitable.

## Grooming and Hygiene

Grooming is an important feature of a hotel professional. The room attendant, floor supervisor, houseman, public area personnel and cloak room attendants have face-to-face contact with guests of the hotel. He, therefore, carries with himself the image of the property. A well-groomed housekeeping member represents qualities of hygiene, professionalism, management style, reliability, etc.

## Some Tips for a Male Housekeeping Professional

- 1. Hair should be cut close.
- 2. The uniform should be spotless and well ironed. A tight or oversized uniform should be avoided as it gives a sloppy appearance.
- 3. Nails should be well manicured and hands absolutely clean. This is important especially since housekeeping personnel deal with the most intimate part of the guest's stay-the room.
- 4. Staff must guard against body odours or cheap perfumes. The market has some wonderful anti-perspirants.
- 5. Shoes should always be polished, and of a conservative style.
- 6. A close shave is necessary before starting duty. Stubbles of a beard or moustache should be avoided as they could look uncomely.
- 7. Bad breath could be nauseating to a guest since a houseman could speak to the guest at close proximity.
- 8. Uniforms must be crisply ironed and clean.

## Some Tips for a Female Housekeeping Professional

- 1. The elastic hair band should always be clean.
- 2. High heels could be physically strenuous to the women as they have to be on their feet for a complete shift. Flat shoes with sturdy heels are advisable.
- 3. Stockings should be clean.
- 4. It  is  preferred  for  them  to  wear  a  light  make-up  to  project  a professional working image.
- 5. Excessive jewellery should be avoided.
- 6. A very strong perfume could leave its presence in a room. Some guests could feel nauseated. Fresh light cologne is preferable.
- 7. Uniforms must be crisply ironed and clean.

## Basic Etiquettes

The hotel business is a social business. All front/line personnel are required to have the ability to communicate effectively with certain manners and etiquettes associated to a good host.

The basic etiquettes that a housekeeping member should exhibit are to:

- 1. Smile and attend to guests as soon as they approach them. Acknowledge their presence by wishing them the time of the day.
- 2. Recognise guests-Recognition is a powerful tool to use for regular guests. The use of their name gives them importance and a feeling of belonging.
- 3. Be polite to guests by frequently using terms such as 'Thank you', 'Please', 'May I help you?', 'Excuse me', 'Pardon me', etc.
- 4. Avoid mannerisms such as touching the hair, scratching oneself, picking the nose, etc.
- 5. Stand erect at all times.
- 6. Listen carefully to guest needs. Note down their requests and room number.
- 7. Assist  guests  wherever  possible  especially  in  providing  them  information  about  hotel services. This requires thorough knowledge of hotel services. Take action on the request immediately.
- 8. Talk softly.
- 9. Avoid arguing with service staff and guests on the floors and public areas.
- 10. Carry pencils in the pockets and not behind ears or clipped in front of the uniform.
- 11. Desist from chewing gum or beetle nut.
- 12. Enter and leave the floor through the service door only.
- 13. Shut the doors quietly.

## Orderliness

Guests evaluate a property by how orderly the hotel personnel are. They observe whether the maid's carts are kept clean and in an orderly fashion. Corridors must be kept clean and free from litter.

- 1. Keep all linen and supplies in the maid's cart in an orderly manner.
- 2. Ensure that flower displays in rooms and floor foyers are fresh and properly arranged. Contact the florist if necessary.
- 3. Keep the access door to the service landings closed at all times. Most properties install a swing door with a peep window.
- 4. Floor foyer telephone tables must be kept clean at all times. A handy duster is helpful to keep the counter tops clean and polished.
- 5. Ensure that cigarette urns in the foyer are cleared of cigarette butts regularly.
- 6. Garbage hampers are essential features of maid's carts and garbage chutes are important in service landings.

## Teamwork

Teams have become the cornerstones of service operations. A poor team performance can severely damage the establishment's reputation, while superior team performance directly enhances it.  Teamwork is one of the essential competencies at the time of recruitment. Results are the responsibility of the entire team and not the team leader alone. Team dynamics have changed over the years. Let us understand the anatomy of teamwork.

## What is a Team?

A team is a small group of people, who rely on each other to achieve a common goal.

No one person can deliver any goals. It takes a team with complimentary skills to deliver results and hold themselves responsible for a success or failure.

## Why should we have Teams?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Teams can meet significant performance challenges. They have a common purpose and are able to assist when a team member is slow. They harness the complimentary skills of team members and have trust in their competency. They can be an influence on each other to be ethical, disciplined, and motivating.

## Who is the Team in a Housekeeping Operation?

The direct teams are the teams of the floor supervisors with their coterie of room attendants and housemen and the team of the Public Area Supervisor with her team of housemen; and the linen/ uniform supervisor with her team of attendants and helpers. The indirect teams are the teams of the head gardener comprising gardeners; maintenance personnel who rectify engineering problems; and the laundry who supplies fresh linen and uniforms; etc. The performance of indirect teams is crucial to the success of direct teams.

## What is the Team Leader's Role?

The team leader's role is to build commitment to the common purpose. He or she fills gaps in competencies; delegates leadership; is himself/herself a hands-on performer with the team; makes key decisions and manages external relationships including the management, guests, and suppliers.

## What are the Team Member's Qualities?

They are all performers who find excitement in their performance. They take ownership of the task and objectives and hold themselves accountable for success or failure. They have a sense of urgency with youthful enthusiasm and energy. They are result oriented and respect each other.

## Attitude

Attitude is a buzzword in modern operations. We wear an attitude. In other words, attitudes are something that we own and are responsible for. It comes from within and can be positive or negative, based on one's experiences. Let us take an inventory of key attitudes required in housekeeping operations:

- 1. The joy of serving people -The benefits of service are many. People are giving business to those who have better service. A good service gets better paychecks and tips. It ensures repeat customers. Service is the cutting edge.
- 2. A cheerful attitude -It is infectious and spreads cheer and goodwill to others. It fosters a pleasant and tension-free workplace.

- 3. Cooperation is vital in team performances. Unless you do not cooperate with others, they will not cooperate with you.
- 4. Pride in one's work -This brings excellence. There is a difference between doing routine work and doing work with an aim to make a difference. Service can be done with showmanship, sincerity and enthusiasm.
- 5. Initiative -This is a valued competency in today's world. The only way to beat competition is to innovate and bring in new ideas. Each housekeeping professional must always

<!-- image -->

- look for new ideas and introduce them. Some may have the benefit of directly introducing new ideas, while others will need to seek the approval of superiors.
- 6. Salesmanship -This is a vital job requirement to motivate the guest to spend that extra dollar.
- 7. Honesty -This is a precious attribute. There are many temptations in a service operation. There are opportunities for theft of property and guest belongings; misleading guests with information; giving secrets to competitors; etc. Organisations value and reward employees who are upright and truthful.

## Self-Discipline

Discipline is the hallmark of a good housekeeping professional. This is because the temptations in a hotel are many. Discipline is of two typesphysical , where grooming and physical conduct play a role; and mental , which demands sincerity, honesty and perseverance. Here are some tips for the housekeepers and supervisors to prevent indiscipline:

- 1. Update continuously with the house rules and regulations.
- 2. Make disciplined behaviour bring reputation, recognition, better rewards.
- 3. Act professionally at work by being businesslike in actions and conversation.
- 4. Amend mistakes immediately.
- 5. Always air grievances in privacy.
- 6. Be an example to others.
- 7. Improve skills by training to avoid mistakes that may be viewed as indiscipline.

Given below, on the left are the common reasons for indiscipline, while on the right side are the suggested positive ways to look at them:

- (a) Unavoidable Circumstances
- (b) Adventurism
- (c) System of Control
- (d) Ignorance of Rules

Sometimes there are sickness or pressing domestic demands-this is normally excused provided this is not too regular. Inform the superior in advance for her to make alternative arrangements. Remember your team needs you.

The desire to be different can be converted into challenges at the workplace. Ask the supervisor for additional tasks. Self-regulation is one of the empowerment tools given to modern professionals.

It  is  important  to  update  oneself  constantly  with  the current  rules  and  regulations.  Clarify  rules  during briefing. Ignorance of rules is a crime.

- (e) To Attract Attention

Get attention by excellent performance.

- (f) Does not Accept the System

Clarify problems and doubts openly with the superiors and if not satisfied seek alternate employment.

- (g) Rebel

Rebels are those who bring about change. Change can be instituted  through  dialogue  and  cooperation  with superiors and not by rebellion.

- (h) Affiliation with Negative Groups

Negative  groups  are  counter-productive  to  good performance. Associate with winners.

- (i) Bad Habits

Cultivate good habits.

- (j) Short Cuts

Distinguish between innovation and taking short cuts. Innovations do not harm the organisation, while short cuts do.

## Courtesy

- 1. It is the hallmark of a hotel professional. Courtesy must be shown not only towards guests, but also towards colleagues.
- 2. Courtesy should be inherent in one's nature and a sign of one's desire to please those with whom one comes in contact with. Courtesy should not be a 'technique' but a spontaneous and genuine manner.
- 3. Being courteous not only makes the operations smooth, but also ensures better relationships.

Examples of courtesy are:

- (a) Each approaching guest must be attended to with a smile and a cheery greeting.

<!-- image -->

- (b) If the staff member knows the guest's name, it is advisable to address him or her by the name as this gives the guest recognition. Do not mispronounce names or call them by somebody else's name!
- (c) If rooms are not ready when a resident guest arrives, ask them if you should return later. If they permit you to continue, complete the task quietly and quickly.
- (d) When a guest is seeking assistance on the floor use the word 'assist', e.g. 'May I assist you' or 'May I be of assistance'.
- (e) When listening to guest requests or complaints, show empathy and tell them what you will do to meet that need or resolve the complaint. Then do it. A guest must not need to remind housekeeping about the issue again.
- (f) After completing any transaction say, 'Thank you, have a pleasant day'. It should be said with utmost sincerity.

## Intrapreneurship

Intrapreneurship means 'internal entrepreneurship.' Housekeeping professionals must think like businesspersons by constantly evaluating one's performance and find ways to improve productivity and quality. They should also be resourceful to meet emergency situations. The housekeeping thinks dollars and how to give the owner a return on investment.

<!-- image -->

## Continuous Education

Housekeeping professionals will be required to upgrade themselves constantly. They should not wait for the organisation to improve their knowledge and skills, but take initiative for self-development. They can do this by reading relevant trade magazines, learning through websites, attending seminars, joining professional bodies that advance knowledge, go back to hotel schools to learn or read textbooks of hotel schools. Organisations expect the true professional to convert new ideas into business opportunities for the hotel and are willing to reward such enterprise. A follow-up on learning is certification. Professionals show physical proof of their learning. The effort of the future professional must be to get more technical qualifications.

## Customer Orientation

The customer is the king. Unless a hotel makes the customer as their main focus, the business is likely to decline. Customer focus means putting all thoughts and actions towards creating positive customer experiences. This is achieved through empathy and proverbially described as 'putting yourself in the guest's shoes'. It requires sensitivity to guest needs and responding to them in a timely manner. If a lady guest requires a hairdryer at the middle of the night, she must have it! Excuses for inaction are many, but going that extra mile to provide the guest needs makes the difference between one hotel and another.

## Physical Fitness

The television has rightly exposed the public to health and fitness. A housekeeping professional must be physically fit to manage rigorous hours on his/her feet. There is a saying that 'a healthy body makes a healthy mind'. It is very true. If a person is physically fit it translates into energy, enthusiasm, ability to cope, lightness, youth and joy. Housekeeping professionals must bring in physical fitness regimen into their personal lives. It may be just an hour's walk in one's neighbourhood or a workout in a gymnasium.

## Eye for Detail

Housekeepers worldwide have been known for their eye for detail. This term means that the person has a sharp eye to detect things that are not quite right. It is in view of this competency that women are selected as housekeepers, and it is presumed that women acquire a greater eye for detail from their roles at home. However, men have also come into housekeeping and have shown this competency over the years. This competency appears repeatedly in all housekeeping job descriptions.

## INTRODUCTION

The Executive Housekeeper is a very critical and vital position in the running of a hotel. She often has the largest team in the hotel, as her responsibilities are spread over the entire hotel, externally and internally. As mentioned earlier, she is accountable for the cleanliness, maintenance and aesthetic upkeep of the property. This requires the creativity of an artist and the efficiency of a scientist. Her department runs 24 hours and this requires sound management. To begin with, let us see how her job description looks like.

A job description is a written account of a job performed by a person. It specifies the parameters within which a job is to be performed. These parameters include the duties and responsibilities, reporting relationships, authority and control, coordination with other departments, status within a departmental hierarchy and the broad scope of function. A job description offers the following advantages to both the job holders and the organization:

- 1. The new recruit knows exactly what his or her job entails. This in itself is a vital part of induction when he or she joins the hotel.
- 2. A job description is a basis to set standards of performance.
- 3. It ensures a common perception of the job by both the superior and the subordinate.
- 4. It is a legal document for any disputes arising out of a lack of role clarification.
- 5. It protects an employee from an unreasonable superior who may like to overburden an employee through unnecessary role deviations.

In addition, a job description includes a job specification which describes the person in terms of education, experience, skills and competencies to perform a job. Some organisations may develop

70

job specifications separately, but the modern practice is to include them in the job description itself. Given below is a typical job description of an Executive Housekeeper:

## DUTIES OF AN EXECUTIVE HOUSEKEEPER

We have realised by now that the Executive Housekeeper is the Head of Department (HOD) and is a senior member of the management team and in many cases reports directly to the General Manager of the hotel. Having said this, there are organisations that may position their Executive Housekeeper either below or above the HOD level, as a member of the Executive Committee. Some organisations may position its Executive Housekeeper at the corporate level as a Corporate Housekeeper. The positioning is based on the housekeeper's experience and seniority. Whatever the case is, it is a management position requiring the traditional management functions of Planning,

Organising, Directing, Controlling and Staffing. These functions translate into housekeeping duties as follows.

## PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES

The Executive Housekeeper at the outset has to plan her activities for a year. While the cleaning of rooms and public areas is quite a routine activity, she has to plan her resources to achieve her tasks in terms of workforce, budgets, supplies, equipment and time. She would be actively involved in recruitment and training after determining how many people she would require in three shifts to achieve her goals.

## Workforce Planning

How does the Executive Housekeeper decide on how many people she requires? She depends on some norms or thumb rules gathered from years of experience and industry practice. Some of these yardsticks are given below:

One can see that the numbers will increase with the size of the property. The housekeeper would decide which positions are to be filled by full-time salaried employees, part-time employees, who earn hourly wages to fill in gaps; and outsourced contractors to do specialist jobs like carpet shampooing, chandelier cleaning, external window cleaning, and so on. These decisions are based on demand and supply of human resources.

While the above table deals with how many people are required to fulfil housekeeping services to customer satisfaction, the other aspect of workforce planning is the quality of staff required. The housekeeper would take the help of Human Resources Department to carry out job analysis (what

74

is required in a job); job evaluation (the value of the position in relation to others) to determine the level in the hierarchy in terms of responsibilities and compensation worth; job description (to formally describe the job position); and job specification (profile of the job the person is suitable to do).

Armed with the numbers and quality of people required, the housekeeper can go ahead and recruit the right person for the right job.

## PLANNING OF HOUSEKEEPING BUDGET

A budget is  the  forecast of expected revenues and expenditures at the beginning of a financial year. It is a planning function and later used as a means of controlling finances. A budget is a management tool and not an accounting tool. However, it uses the accounting process established for a business. A sound knowledge of accounting reports is essential for an Executive Housekeeper to prepare a budget. For instance, she must know the components of a profit and loss expected statement and how it is presented. It only differs from pure accounting by noting predictions while accounting records actual facts. The housekeeping budget must cover a period that is controllable. Most hotels prepare an annual budget as a reasonable period for control. An interesting feature of the housekeeping department is that while it prepares rooms for sale, the actual revenue reflects in the front-office budget. The Housekeeping Department remains an expense centre and, therefore, mentions costs of maintaining rooms. However, the Housekeeping Budget starts with the expected income and occupancy throughout the year. The expenses of maintaining guest rooms are a relation to the revenues received from these rooms. The accommodations budget, however, is a composite of the front-office revenues and the housekeeping expenses. However, the expenses of housekeeping must factor in anticipated occupancies and should be kept within the revenues generated.

There are two types of budgets: the capital budget , which is a statement of the expenses covering long-term assets like linen, equipment and furniture that will be used for more than a year and the operating budget , which lays down the anticipated expenses in daily consumables like guest supplies and cleaning supplies to do business on a daily basis. When preparing a budget, there are certain rules to be followed:

- The goals set by a budget must be attainable. Many investors have set unrealistic sales and expense goals that demoralise the performing teams affected by it.
- There should be wide participation in the budgeting process. An Executive Housekeeper who prepares the budget without involving the housekeeping team can set goals that the team is unable to attain. Participation of the team gets the team member's commitment to perform and achieve.
- All  members of the team must be informed of the approved budget. Many Executive Housekeepers believe that they are the only ones privileged to see the budget and try to steer the team towards it when the team itself is in the dark as to what they are expected to achieve.
- The budget must be completed before the performing period. Teams cannot be held accountable for the time that has elapsed.
- We have seen that the budget is a measure of performance. Employees must know exactly that their role is to attain the budget goals.

## The Executive Housekeeper

<!-- image -->

- Employees must have authority and control over their work process. They must be able to influence the amount that they are accountable for.
- Budgets must be flexible to permit revisions for unanticipated changes.
- Budgets must not compromise on quality and guest satisfaction. The table below gives an idea of the items that come under capital budgets and operating budgets:

| Capital Expenses                                                                                                                                       | Operating Expenses                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linen -For guest rooms, restaurants and  bars                                                                                                          | Salaries and Wages -Full-time, part-time  and daily wagers                                                                                           |
| Equipment -Such as vacuum cleaners,  scrubbers, maid's carts, trolleys, hampers, filing  cabinets, lawn movers, laundry equipment and  sewing machines | Employee Benefits -Usually, 1½ times the  basic salary Outsourced Contractors -External window  cleaners,  chandelier  cleaners  and  pest  control  |
| Furniture -Racks, folding tables,  desks,  chairs and cupboards  Fixtures -Guest room lamps and lamp  shades                                           | Operating  Supplies -Guest amenities,  cleaning supplies, dusters, mops, flower pots  and manure Stationery -Guest stationery and office  stationery |

## Capital Budget

Capital budget items are usually expensive like equipment or linen. The decision to purchase them has to be carefully thought out in terms of whether they are really necessary immediately. While purchasing capital items, one must keep the following factors in mind:

- Expected life of the asset and its durability
- Cost of asset, including taxes or custom duty
- Competitive alternatives available in the market
- Whether the item is purchased locally or abroad
- After-sales services
- Availability of spare parts (in terms of equipment)
- Lead time for purchase and replacement
- Whether the item is custom made or off the shelf
- Other hotels' feedback on the use of the assets and suppliers
- Whether to buy the item or hire it
- Cost of maintenance
- Cost of accessories (to equipment)

## Operating Budget

The expenses under operating budget usually recur daily or monthly for maintaining assets and providing guest services. Some of the operating expenses featuring in a Housekeeping Budget would be:

76

- 1. Salaries, wages and benefits: This would perhaps be the largest expense of the housekeeping department. It includes the compensation to full-time employees, part-timers, daily wagers and apprentices. We all know that hotels provide benefits to employees. These benefits will reflect under this head and include house rent or housing costs; uniforms for housekeeping staff; duty meals; health insurance; transportation; leave pay; and social welfare.
- 2. Cleaning supplies and detergents: This  could  well  be  the  next  highest  expense  as  the department is concerned with cleaning as its primary function. Cleaning supplies would include consumable items like buckets, mops, brushes and the like. Detergents include cleaning powders and solutions for various surfaces in the hotel. The laundry is the greatest consumer of detergents in view of the large volume of linen and uniforms that are laundered each day. Then there is the cost of laundering guest laundry, which is factored into the price to guests for laundering their clothes.
- 3. Guest amenities: This category includes all those items in guest rooms that are to be exclusively used by the guests. These include writing pens, soaps, vanity sets, drinking tumblers, guest hangers, bathrobes, bath slippers, and special supplies to VIPs like flowers and cakes. These costs may find their way to direct costs before gross profit.
- 4. Printing and Stationery Expenses: Stationery  may be divided into what is required for housekeeping use such as forms and formats; and those required for guests such as guest stationery, feedback forms, room service menus, tent cards used in rooms selling other facilities, and so on.
- 5. Other Supplies: These would include all items that are required to keep the housekeeping running like seeds and manure for the gardens; flowers for floral arrangements throughout the hotel; maintenance of the nursery and greenhouse and others.
- 6. Energy: This is an item that is growing in cost every day. The cost of power and steam is high. Apart from the electricity consumed by the housekeeping department like in the linen/uniform room, control desk room, housekeeper's office, etc., there is a huge cost of power to run the heavy equipment in laundry. The laundry also needs steam to operate the steam presses.
- 7. Water: There is a large requirement for water in housekeeping. The Housekeeping Department needs water to service the external gardens; terrace gardens; indoor plants, floor pantries, and so on. The largest consumer of water is the laundry for the cleaning of linen and uniforms.
- 8. Telecommunications: There is  an  expense  for  external  calls  to  suppliers  and  guests. Sometimes, the Information Technology Department may apportion costs of web-based communications to the Housekeeping Department.
- 9. Advertising and Promotion: These costs may be apportioned to all revenue departments as the cost to get business. Media costs are expensive and need considerable allocations.
- 10. Repair and Maintenance Costs: These are the expenses that the Housekeeping Department needs to keep the rooms fresh and serviceable. These may include costs of renovating a room.
- 11. Contracts: These are the expenses for hiring outsourced services like commercial laundries, interior designers, horticulturists, external window cleaners, chandelier cleaners and the like.

## Developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a written routine procedure for daily operations.  It is a tool to standardise the accomplishment of tasks. The benefit of an SOP is that everyone is trained into it to bring about consistency in (a) service performance; (b) quality standards; (c) productivity norms; (d) interdepartmental collaboration; (e) generation of reports for decision-making and cooperation; and (f) the correct use of equipment and materials. There is a tacit understanding in

77

professional housekeeping operations that SOPs are to be followed and no deviations should be tolerated. Revision of  SOP is done after an approval at the highest level. SOPs are documented and numbered in a manual that is available to everybody to refer to in case of doubt. SOPs start with statement of policy governing the procedure, followed by procedural directives, type of forms to be used and records to be generated. While there is an argument that SOPs stifle creativity, employees do have an opportunity to suggest better ways to do things and influence SOPs. SOPs are best for routine recurring items. An example of SOP is given below:

Department:

Housekeeping Department

SOP No:

SOP-001

Date Issued:

7/9/2011

Name of Hotel:

Hotel ABC

Procedure:

Lost and Found

Approved by: Ms. Jane Wood (Exec. HK)

## Background

Guests or employees in the hotel sometimes forget or misplace their personal belongings. The hotel holds and stores these items in safekeeping. If the guest or employee is known as the legitimate owner of the item, all efforts are made to contact the concerned person. Should the owner not be known, then the item is locked for a period of six months, during which period the guest or employee can lay a claim. After six months, the item is auctioned, given free to the person finding the item or sold at a discounted price.

Policy: (a) The Housekeeping Department shall be responsible for the safekeeping  and dispensation of Lost and Found items.

- (b) Lost and Found items will be stored for minimum six months.
- (c) The finder of the item has first claim on a Lost and Found item at no cost.

## Procedure

- 1. When a member of the staff finds an item, he or she is expected to immediately inform his or her immediate supervisor and hand over the item.
- 2. The supervisor will immediately call the Housekeeping Desk Attendant who will verify with the Front Office Cashier in case the guest is known whether he or she is still in the hotel clearing his or her bills. Simultaneously, the Lobby Manager is also notified. If the guest is present, the item is immediately handed over to the guest.
- 3. The Supervisor deposits it at the Housekeeping Control Desk for documentation and custody.
- 4. The Housekeeping Desk Attendant will enter the item into the serially numbered.  Lost and Found Slip in duplicate giving the date, time, room number (if a resident guest), location, guest's name and the name of the staff who found the item.
- 5. The original slip is attached to the article and stored in the Lost and Found safe cupboard. The duplicate slip is kept in the Lost and Found Register which records all the details of the slip, including the slip number.
- 6. The Executive Housekeeper will sign the Register to acknowledge the receipt of the same.
- 7. The Executive Housekeeper will write to the guest to claim the article getting the address from the Front Office in case of a known resident guest who has checked out.
- 8. If the guest is not known, the item is stored for a period of six months and disposed of as per the policy of the property.

## DIRECTING RESPONSIBILITIES

Briefing is that process at the beginning of a work shift which is initiated by management to facilitate two-way communication between the management and the staff. It takes place once at the beginning of a shift when the housekeeping staff assemble to share information and feelings before they disperse for work. This is after the employees have formally clocked into the hotel at the time office and have collected their fresh uniforms which they change in the locker rooms, provided separately for men and women. All employees are required to report for briefing properly attired and before the scheduled commencement of the shift.

In the Housekeeping Department, briefing is conducted at the Housekeeping Control Desk room. Ideally, the Executive Housekeeper must conduct the briefing. However, when she is busy she may delegate this responsibility to the Assistant Housekeeper. Given below are the issues covered in a briefing that takes about 15 minutes:

## Grooming

Each staff member is checked for whether his or her grooming meets standards (as discussed in detail in Lesson 7, 'Competencies of a Housekeeping Professional'). Physical presentation is vital in the hospitality industry as it provides the vital physical evidence of intangibles such as efficiency, cleanliness, professionalism, identity and hygiene.

## Allotment of Duties

Housekeeping personnel are allotted their duties. Some housekeepers rotate staff on floors and public areas while others may assign dedicated floors and public areas on the belief that this brings about ownership of their domain. Supervisors are assigned to floors. The Public Area Supervisor receives special instructions about public areas that need more attention in a given day. Her duties would also include periodic preventive maintenance schedules like chandelier cleaning, carpet shampooing, wall cleaning and other such tasks.

## Policies and Procedures

The briefing is the opportunity for re-emphasising existing policies and procedures of the property especially those that have an impact on housekeeping staff. It is the time to introduce new policies and give receive queries and clarifications about them.

## VIPs in the House

The Housekeeper gives the names and room numbers of VIPs in the house. Each room attendant will check those room numbers which are in his responsibility. VIP rooms will receive special attention and amenities. The VIP list is further displayed on the communications notice board of the Desk Control room.

## Feedback from Staff

Briefing time is the best opportunity to handle professional grievances that impact the productivity of the staff. (Personal grievances are handled in privacy on a one-to-one basis and not in a public forum

## The Executive Housekeeper

<!-- image -->

like a briefing.) It is beneficial for productivity and morale if grievances are resolved immediately and not allowed to fester. Feedback is valuable in the quest for continuous improvement. Frontline personnel know best how guest experiences can be enhanced by giving suggestions.

## Training

Briefing is the time to coach staff in minor tasks. Staff is trained in the standards of performance. Standards are re-emphasised daily. The Housekeeper gives feedback on supervisor's reports on standards and ascertains those that need training or disciplinary action.

## Recognition and Praise

The briefing time is the best opportunity to praise those who have performed well. It is considered to be a good management practice to praise in public and discipline in private.

## Guest Complaints

In spite of the best intentions, guest complaints continue to occur as each guest perceives service in his/her  own special way. Such complaints are logged by the guest with the (a) Control Desk Supervisor, (b) Guest Relations Executive, (c) Lobby Manager, (d) Guest Comment Forms, (e) General Manager, (f) Floor Supervisor and (g) Room Attendant. Complaints must be looked upon as gifts by the guest to improve services. A guest who does not voice a complaint is dangerous because he would not come again and definitely speak about the bad experience to others. It is best to tackle complaints immediately and encourage suggestions from the housekeeping staff on how to rectify the same.

## Other Information

It is important to give information of a general nature. The housekeeping staff must be integrated with the rest of the hotel so that they see 'the larger picture' of operations rather than being cocooned in their own small world. Some additional information that should be shared is:

- 1. Performance of the hotel
- 2. New projects and developments
- 3. New policies and practices
- 4. Functions in the house
- 5. New management and staff joined in other departments
- 6. Inspections by government authorities in the house
- 7. Special food promotions in restaurants
- 8. Groups and crews expected
- 9. Special requests by guests regarding amenities in the room
- 10. Assignment of babysitting services.

## Assigning Work

An important job of a housekeeper is to ensure that all the responsibilities of the Housekeeping Department are fulfilled to guest satisfaction and the management's quality standards. For this, she has to take into account several factors:

- 1. Creating three shifts: A normal shift (work period per law) is eight hours with an additional hour for lunch/dinner and tea breaks.  A busy hotel would have three shifts to cover 24 hours of the day while a remote resort property may operate with one general shift. Then there is the aspect of covering seven days a week. Employees will also need an off day. The US has a five-day week. This complicates scheduling further to find substitutes (relievers) during the off days. A simple rule of thumb for relievers is one reliever for every six employees (or five employees in the US). The housekeeper has the option of hiring daily wagers; scheduling on the basis on split shifts; creating teams for critical areas who will cover each other; or outsourcing Saturdays and Sundays to an outsourced housekeeping company.
- 2. Covering three shifts: A busy city hotel will need to have all three shifts manned as arrivals and departures are continuous. While the normal check-out time is 12 noon, people may check in at all different hours based on their flight arrivals, road and train schedules, and so on. The housekeeper has to balance the productivity norms, off days, relievers, and peak and trough times. The housekeeper always factors in the expected occupancy to determine the number of people required.

## CONTROLLINGRESPONSIBILITIES

Controlling responsibilities are again an important aspect that the Executive Housekeeper has to take care of. The functions are explained below.

## Taking Attendance

Attendance is taken in every shift as it affects salaries and wages. Some workers are paid hourly wages while others are paid a monthly salary. Salary is related to attendance or the person's presence at work.

The Executive Housekeeper must maintain three attendance registers:

- (a) One that has all the names of housekeeping personnel listed on a single page.
- (b) One that devotes a page to each housekeeping member, recording the number of hours each has worked, along with their off days, overtime statistics and special duties.
- (c) One register that records the hours put in by daily wagers or hourly based employees.

Modern technology has introduced the time card system that does away with tedious registers. The moment an employee is hired, the Human Resources Department issues a time card that is maintained at the time office located at the employee entrance at the back of the hotel. This is a single door through which all employees enter and exit the building. The time office (as the name suggests) is where employees register their time-in and time-out. The time office is manned 24 hours of the day by timekeepers in three shifts because the hotel operation is a 24-hour business with employees entering and exiting continuously. Often, the security personnel at the employeegate take over this role as the gate is manned 24 hours by them. The system consists of specially designed cards with columns for the dates, time-in and time-out and maintained in racks at the time office. The timekeeper punches the time through a time-punch machine each time an employee enters or exits the hotel. This is a foolproof method as machines do not lie. Modern technology has introduced electronic time-punch machines that send the data directly to terminals in the accounts, human resources and the housekeeping control desk. Each one of there departments can monitor when an employee has clocked in and out. To make it foolproof, modern timekeeping machines have introduced the thumbprint to record the attendance.

The registers or time cards are legal documents maintained as per the labour laws and are carefully controlled. While registers are used for a year, time cards are issued each month. The payroll section, located either in the Human Resources Department or the Accounts Department, as per the policy, calculate the salaries and wages given at the end of each month. Some establishments may pay salaries every fortnight to help their employees maintain their personal cash flows. Salary payment schedules are also determined by the labour laws. The Executive Housekeeper must ensure some norms while maintaining the attendance of staff:

- Staff coming late must be marked late because latecoming is taboo in the service industry. Service is provided by 'warm bodies' and latecoming can seriously jeopardise the quality of service. The Human Resources Department can incur legal penalties on the staff through wage deductions to emphasise the importance of attendance.
- The Executive Housekeeper must mark the attendance with a pen to prevent any malpractice. Any additions or deletions must be countersigned by the Housekeeper and employee in acknowledgement of amendments.
- The Executive Housekeeper must counsel habitual latecomers and absentees before taking action. Latecoming and absenteeism are punishable offences and can even lead to dismissal of the employee.
- The Executive Housekeeper and Supervisors must always emphasise the importance of attendance in all briefings.

## Managing Discipline

Discipline is the hallmark of a good hotelier. Discipline is required for many reasons:

- (a) Guests like to see staff in professional outfit doing their duties with clockwork precision.
- (b) Indiscipline reflects on the image of the property, which can be ruined through the word-of-mouth.
- (c) A lack of discipline severely affects the final quality of service - Imagine a room attendant who forgets to log a request for babysitting services by a guest or when a room attendant forgets to leave water tumblers in the room.
- (d) It reflects badly on the hygiene and sanitation standards of the property if employees are not well groomed and hygienically unclean-imagine room attendants with soiled uniforms.

<!-- image -->

- (e) There is discipline in the way employees communicate with guests. A lack of courtesy, etiquettes and manners can spoil the entire experience for a guest.
- (f) Following systems and procedures to avoid chaos during busy operations. Shortcuts to service invariably affect standards.
- (g) Co-ordination with other departments and fellow-members is necessary to get their cooperation. If the kitchen decides to slow down its service, the restaurant brigade will be faced with the wrath of the guests as they are in the frontline.
- (h) Discipline in the punctuality and attendance. If there are no 'warm bodies', the department cannot give the desired standards of service.

Indiscipline happens for several reasons as seen in the previous lesson. Table 8.1 gives the reasons for indiscipline, which are also listed in the previous lesson, and how they can be addressed by the Executive Housekeeper.

## Reasons for Indiscipline

Table 8.1

| Reasons for  Indiscipline         | Course of Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unavoidable Circumstances         | Pressing domestic situations like family sickness, parent-teacher meetings, etc.,  cannot be avoided. These should be excused provided the employee has excused  himself or herself before the operation starts. Any proof like a medical certificate  authenticates an absence, however, the housekeeper is guided by the track record  of the employee. |
| Adventurism                       | Young employees are hot blooded and like to beat the system. Don't kill adventurism  because it can be converted to enthusiasm. Give such staff challenging tasks and  additional responsibilities that will occupy their time and need for adventure.                                                                                                    |
| Lack of  Control  Systems         | Many acts may seem as indiscipline but actually they are caused by a lack of systems  and procedures. A Housekeeper must seal loopholes in the system. A written code of  conduct is also necessary to let employees know the rules. The Housekeeper can seek  the assistance of the Human Resources Department to draw-up a code of conduct.             |
| Ignorance of  Rules               | Ignorance of rules is a crime and therefore, employees can be penalised for this.  However, the Housekeeper must re-emphasise rules during briefings to keep such  things on the top of the mind daily.                                                                                                                                                   |
| To Attract  Attention             | The industrial age has brought isolation and anonymity when huge workforces  are employed. It is easy to be ignored and lonely. Many people deliberately cause  indiscipline to attract the attention of the supervisors. A housekeeper, in the first  instance,  must  know  and  have  a  dialogue  with  his/her  team  collectively  and              |
| Does not  Accept the  System      | The Housekeeper should counsel the employee and make him/her realise the  importance of the system and how it fits into the larger scheme of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Is Rebellious                     | Rebellious people are so because of perceived injustice. The Housekeeper can sit  with the 'rebel' and understand the injustice meted out to him/her. Well-defined  grievance procedures have helped in avoiding rebellious situations. It is important  for the Housekeeper to be fair and equitable in his or her dealings with the team.               |
| Affiliation with Negative  Groups | The Housekeeper should identify these negative groups and their leader. He/she  should try to understand the reasons behind negative behaviour. Win over the group  leader by giving him/her importance and a say in proceedings.                                                                                                                         |
| Bad Habits                        | Reinforce good habits during training sessions and briefings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Short Cuts                        | Penalise the employee after giving two warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Wilful Motives                    | People with wilful motives are dangerous. If counselling has failed, then dismiss  the person from the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

While the above are some reasons for indiscipline and how to deal with them, the following are some general guidelines to maintain a disciplined team:

## The Executive Housekeeper

- 1. Ensure that there are written house rules and code of conduct. These must be distributed to each employee and reinforced at briefings.
- 2. Motivate staff to follow rules and maintain discipline and how it can benefit them in terms of advancement, better tips and cooperation from team members.
- 3. A fault committed must be checked at once.
- 4. Always discipline in private.
- 5. Set an example by being self-disciplined. Staff must see their housekeeper or supervisor as their role model.
- 6. Check the labour laws regarding disciplinary proceedings. Normally two warnings are given in writing before formal charges can be made.
- 7. Take the help of the Human Resources Department who are trained and qualified to handle disciplinary proceedings within the law.

## Cost Control

A measure of increasing the profits of a housekeeping operation is by reducing costs. While this is the responsibility of the entire brigade, the accountability for cost control lies with the Executive Housekeeper. Here are some tips to reduce costs:

- 1. Check that quantity standards are strictly maintained. The guest amenities in a room must number those that are prescribed. The amount of detergents used must be in the correct quantities.
- 2. Staff must be trained to handle equipment correctly. Proper usage gives equipment a longer life.
- 3. Linen is expensive and constitutes a major investment by the owner. It should not be used for wiping tables or floors. Dusters are of cheaper material and used for cleaning purposes.
- 4. Expensive stationery must not be used as rough pads for dawdling.
- 5. Employees must be trained to meet productivity standards. Labour costs consume a large portion of the budget.
- 6. Inspections are important to ensure that correct procedures are followed.
- 7. Staff scheduling must ensure that there is the best utilisation of human resources in any given day.
- 8. Send timely maintenance orders to the maintenance staff. Items fixed on time will avoid higher costs when bigger breakdowns take place.
- 9. Recycle reusable items like flower arrangements, soaps, discarded linen, newspapers, bottles and cans.
- 10. The staff must be trained to complete their tasks correctly the first time round. Repeating a task takes valuable human resource time.
- 11. Florists must raise checks for flower arrangements ordered by guests. Similarly, babysitting services, special laundry charges must be meticulously accounted for.
- 12. The housekeeper must be hawk-eyed for pilferage by staff.
- 13. Ensure the daily cleaning of the premises to keep assets fresh.
- 14. Ensure that the staff strength is optimum to meet business demands. Excess staff is a cost.
- 15. Multi-skilling  is  a  new  method  of  reducing  human  resource  costs  as  people  are  easily exchangeable to perform various tasks.

- 16. Lacquer used on brass preserves brass fixtures longer, thus saving on consumables like Brasso.
- 17. Expensive flower arrangements can be kept longer by pruning decaying flowers only and not changing the whole arrangement.
- 18. Switching off air conditioners when the room is vacant is a good practice to conserve energy. Hotels have installed key holders inside the entrance to switch off lights once the occupant has removed the key.
- 19. Discarded shower curtains can be used as aprons for the butchery or kitchen stewarding.
- 20. Regular stocktaking ensures optimum inventories, loss due to spoilage, theft and wastage.
- 21. Proper storing procedures should be used.
- 22. Use sprinklers in gardens to conserve water.
- 23. Compost dried/dead leaves into manure.

## Inventory Management

The Executive Housekeeper is the custodian of several stores which account for major capital and operational costs. These stores are:

- Linen Store-for a cycle of new linen
- Uniform Room-for recycling fresh staff uniforms in operation for used ones
- Linen Room-for recycling fresh linen for used ones
- Housekeeping equipment store
- Chemical Store-for cleaning detergents and laundry
- Furniture Yard-for storing furniture under repair
- Housekeeping Store-for operational supplies
- Floor Pantries
- Nursery (for young plants) and Greenhouse (for exotic plants)
- Gardeners Shed (garden tools, fertilisers, flowerpots, hoses, and so on)

In order to keep strict control on these valuable assets, the Housekeeper has to follow some strict guidelines:

Market Surveys: The Housekeeper conducts periodic market surveys to ensure quality, price and supply. Surveys are done to determine what is available in the market in terms of housekeeping requirements; who the reliable suppliers are; the right competitive price for the right quality; volume discounts available for bulk purchase; and lead time of supply and financial strength of the supplier.

Establishing Par Levels: A par level is the minimum quantity in stores, required to supply an operation daily. These levels are established by experience and past history of consumption. Each store has a par stock of items to ensure that items do not run out, to service the customer.

Establishing the Lead Time: Lead time is the minimum period required by a supplier to replenish the stock level of a consumer. Each supplier has different time frames to provide items, based on whether the item is custom-made or off-the-shelf; whether it is imported rather than bought domestically; geographic distances of warehouses to the point of supply; and so on. The par stock = the existing quantity +  lead-time quantity. The lead-time quantity would be the amount of stocks consumed from the time of order to the time of supply.

Anticipated Consumption: The amount of anticipated consumption is based on historical data, occupancy levels and level of business. The storage space must match the realistic consumption levels to ensure supplies are in stock.

Monitoring Consumption: It is a key duty of the Executive Housekeeper to keep consumption within budgets. The best is to have a documented system of requisition. It starts with store requisitions which have to be monitored closely. It has to be ensured that the store issues exactly what has been approved by the housekeeper; the items used follow proper procedures of use; the maintenance requests are attended to immediately; there is a system of preventive maintenance for equipment; the staff are properly trained in the use of these assets; and reusable items are carefully stored as prescribed.

## Inspections

Daily property inspections are an inherent task of a Housekeeper, who becomes a good exponent of 'managing by walk-about'. She may or may not have a checklist of things to observe. A trained Housekeeper has an eye to seek out things not to standards. Her walk would cover guest floors, pantries and guest rooms; recreation areas like swimming pools, spas, tennis courts, etc.; restaurants, bars and lounges; banquets and meeting rooms; offices, locker rooms, stores, landscaped areas, etc. It is a strenuous task that takes hours. However, this is the only way she can ensure standards are kept consistently. During her rounds, she looks for quality standards, gives information, provides coaching tips, listens  to  personal  and  professional  grievances,  facilitates  coordination,  solves operational problems and disciplines staff.

## ORGANISING RESPONSIBILITIES

## Employee Scheduling

The scheduling of employees of the Housekeeping Department is very demanding and critical as it has a large workforce and the greatest proportion of employee hours to cover. Moreover, unlike the restaurant and bar, which generate revenues that cover employee costs, housekeeping is a cost centre. Revenue centres can afford to add employees as the potential for revenue increases. Housekeeping does not have this flexibility. Each employee added has to justify the cost of such addition. The Housekeeping Department is very visible to guests and any deficiency in standards of housekeeping is immediately noticed. The Executive Housekeeper is challenged to ensure the right mix of employees that uphold the tasks of keeping a clean house to the highest standards.

The housekeeping department has an elaborate employee structure depending on the size of hotel. (See Lesson 6, 'Organisation of the Housekeeping Department' for more details.) Employee scheduling ensures employee presence and satisfies the following requirements:

- 1. The type of hotel and guest, e.g. business people require quicker and closer attention than people on holiday.
- 2. The number of guests staying in the hotel. Fortunately, most people book ahead and the expected occupancy is known. Scheduling ensures that the demands during the business hours are met.
- 3. It provides a human face.

- 4. It takes into account employee leaves and the weekly off-day, without affecting service.
- 5. It rotates employees equitably through shifts and holidays. Hotel business is a 24 7 business and not all employees can get leave on the same day. Guests occupy rooms even on weekends and national holidays. Staff have to be on duty to give the guests their service.
- 6. It distributes off-days fairly as given in the schedule below.
- 7. It is planned in advance before it becomes effective to enable employees to plan their personal commitments.

Every schedule is authorised by the Executive Housekeeper and ensures optimal deployment to ensure that peak hours are fully serviced with competent employees. Busy hotels like downtown hotels, business hotels or airport hotels run a 24 7 operation and have morning, afternoon, and night shifts. The simplest way to schedule employees is given below:

|                | Mon       | Tue                 | Wed       | Thurs     | Fri       | Sat                           | Sun       |

One observes that each employee gets a day off in the week. A reliever position is created to substitute the employee on leave on a particular day.

## Considerations while Scheduling

Employee scheduling is not that simple in large busy hotels. The following considerations are shown when scheduling employees:

- 1. Occupancy of  the  hotel.  The  numbers  change  appreciably  during  peak  season  and  off season.
- 2. Productivity standards and whether the staff can meet them. For example, the guest room cleaning standard is 16 rooms to a room attendant in a shift.
- 3. Hotel's age. Scheduling for an existing hotel is easier as past records exist as a guide. New hotels rely on data from competing hotels.

- 4. Software makes scheduling easier. However, they are expensive.
- 5. Employee vacations have to be factored in. This is controlled by an annual leave plan.
- 6. Staff turnover affects scheduling. The responsibility of an employee who has left has to be distributed among others. Past records are a useful guideline.
- 7. Absenteeism, sickness, and holidays have to be considered based on historical data and known future holidays.
- 8. Training days of employees is essential to be built into a schedule as continuous education and training is now a way of life.
- 9. Work practice improvements affect productivity and the number of people required.
- 10. Job rotation to develop employees and reduce boredom through routine.
- (i) Polishing brassware
- (ii) Exchanging linen
- (iii) Collecting supplies from stores
- (iv) Preparing the Housekeeping Report
- (v) Checking fire prevention systems
- (vi) Providing babysitting services (after work hours)
- (vii) Manning the Control Desk
- (viii) Cleaning the floor pantry
- 11. Equitable workloads so that everyone gets exactly the right number of hours of work at the least cost to the hotel.
- 12. Assignment of duties must be fair and equitable. No employee must be overburdened to an extent that his or her productivity is affected.

## Performance Appraisal

It is the responsibility of the Executive Housekeeper to introduce, train and monitor the performance management programme in the housekeeping department. She may take the help of the Human Resources Department to train the staff into the scheme. Modern management practices are interested in results rather than activities. Each member of the staff has to think in terms of the positive contributions he or she makes towards the operations of the department. The Executive Housekeeper should identify Key Result Areas (KRAs) for each job position. KRAs make a difference to the operation. It could be in terms of cost savings; customer satisfaction; maintaining housekeeping standards; productivity; teamwork; new ideas to do things better; punctuality and attendance, and so on. Typically, the KRAs are discussed before a budget year and the performance towards them noted for review in every quarter of that year and finally at the end of the year. The KRA objectives must follow the SMART principle (i.e., S pecific, M easureable, A chievable, R ealistic, T ime). The end of the year rewards are linked to the achievement in terms of bonus, increment, and recognition. Normally, the appraisal system cascades down where immediate supervisors first fill the appraisal form after a discussion at an appraisal interview. The completed form is sent to the next higher authority (e.g. Assistant Housekeeper) for a second opinion and finally to the Executive Housekeeper who assesses the rewards to each employee based on her budgets and finally sends it to the HR Department for processing.

## STAFFING RESPONSIBILITIES

People are the greatest challenge to the hospitality industry and particularly to the Executive Housekeeper. Her workforce is the largest in the property and, therefore, she needs trained people in her team. The housekeeping team would consist of full-time workers, part-time workers and daily-wage workers. She is forced to look at innovative sources of supply of human resources to keep her work going, including housewives, college students, single mothers and the like. The Executive Housekeeper would have to acquire interviewing skills.

An Executive Housekeeper has internal and external sources of supply of human resources. Her ally is  the  Human Resources Department, which will assist her with the procurement of staff. The internal sources are internal promotions, the talent bank, transfers from other departments, transfers from other hotels of a chain; recommendations from employees of friends and relatives they know. The external sources would include applicants to job advertisements, recruitment agents, employment exchanges, hotel schools, headhunters, and so on.

## HOUSEKEEPING FLOOR PROCEDURES

<!-- image -->

## The Floor Pantry

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## INTRODUCTION

The floor pantry (also called the floor linen room ) is a store that stocks linen and supplies for a given floor. It is normally situated away from guest view, such as the elevator landing or the end of a floor. The room should be a cool and dry place away from steam pipes and dust.

## FURNITURE AND FIXTURES

The floor linen room has the following furniture and fixtures:

- 1. Cupboard for guest and cleaning supplies.
- 2. Racks with shelves for linen, blankets, pillows, newspapers, bottles, etc. These can be wooden or made of aluminium.
- 3. Janitors closet for cleaning equipment such as mops, vacuum cleaners, waste baskets, buckets, squeegees, etc.
- 4. Wooden or canvas lined hampers for soiled linen received from various maid's carts on the floor, before sending the linen to the laundry. The hampers can be fixed or mobile (as shown in the picture) for easy transportation to the laundry.
- 5. Space for maid's carts (pictures given on pg 94), baby cots and roll-away beds.
- 6. Sinks for flower arrangements and disinfecting tumblers.

## FLOOR LAYOUT AND BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE FLOOR PANTRY

The  pieces  of  equipment  mentioned  above  are positioned in the Floor Pantry as shown in Fig. 9.1.

## Layout Tips

- 1. The floor pantry must be out of the view of guests, preferably on service landings.
- 2. The room should be accessible from the service elevator, especially to transport soiled linen to the laundry and supply trolleys from stores.
- 3. The room must have one door only for security reasons.
- 4. The furniture is against the walls leaving space in the centre for movement.
- 5. The sink must have a water connection and a proper drainage.

## Storage Tips

While storing there are certain precautions taken for safe storage as given below:

- 1. Brushes must not rest on bristles.
- 2. Cleaning sprays must be away from hot areas.
- 3. Dusters must be dried before storing.
- 4. Buckets must be emptied of all water and dried before storing.
- 5. Polishes must be properly sealed to prevent drying.
- 6. At the end of the shift all used magazines, newspapers and empty bottles are sent to the garbage disposal area where independent bins for each are allocated. These items are recycled by agencies.
- 7. Used candles and soaps are deposited at the Control Desk for reuse in offices, staff locker rooms, etc.
- 8. Garbage must be examined by the Floor Supervisor for any 'lost and found' articles before sending it to the garbage disposal areas.
- 9. The Floor Supervisor is the only authorised person to open and close the floor linen room.

Floor Pantry layout

## Basic Principles

The floor pantry should be kept locked at all times as expensive assets like linen, guest supplies, etc. are stored here. The Floor Supervisor is the only one with the key and is the custodian of all the assets in the room. The room should be clean at all times especially when the staff go off duty.

## Maintaining Par Stocks

The floor pantry is expected to keep a par stock of linen, guest supplies, and operational supplies to service the guest rooms on a floor. Naturally, the size and storage capacity of the floor pantry will vary according to the number of rooms on that floor. The par stock is based on historical data of occupancy on the floor in various seasons. For example, the floor supervisor maintains a bed sheet turnover of four:

- 1. One set on the guest bed
- 2. One set in the Floor Pantry/maid's cart
- 3. One set in the Laundry
- 4. One set in the Linen Room
- 5. One set in the Housekeeping Store

The exact number of sets is based on the anticipated occupancy. Linen stocktaking is done monthly as it is an expensive asset. On the day of stocktaking, all floor supervisors are informed. A suitable time on that day (say, 3.00 pm) is frozen when no exchange of linen is undertaken, either with the laundry or with the linen room. The linen is physically counted at each location and filled in the 'Linen Stock Sheet'. A sample of Linen Stock Sheet is given in Fig. 9.2.

## REQUISITIONING PROCEDURES

## Procedure for Requisitioning Fresh Linen

- 1. Soiled linen is sorted by types, counted and recorded in three copies in the Room Linen Control Sheet (Fig. 9.3) by the floor supervisor at the pantry.
- 2. The houseman takes two copies with the soiled linen to the laundry.
- 3. The laundry supervisor recounts the items and tallies the numbers with the Room Linen Control Sheet.
- 4. The laundry supervisor retains one copy after signing the Room Linen Control Sheet
- 5. The houseman takes the second copy to the Linen Supervisor for fresh supplies of linen.

Room Linen Control Sheet

## Procedure for Requisitioning Guest Supplies and Cleaning Supplies

## Basic Principles

- (a) A floor pantry is given a par stock for each item of supplies.
- (b) When supplies at the floor pantry fall below the par stock, the Floor Supervisor prepares a Weekly Stores List (Fig. 9.4). The columns marked 'consumed' and 'required' are a control measure to ensure that the requisitions do not exceed consumption. The column 'received' gives quantities actually issued by the stores. This is particularly useful when items are short to claim in future.

## The Floor Pantry

- (c) Requisitioning must be done strictly against consumption.
- (d) Requisitioning is done on a weekly basis.
- (e) Weekly Stores List must be prepared and presented on the day allotted to the floor for requisitioning.

Weekly Stores List

Note: The list above is only a representative one. Each hotel will have its list of supplies.

## Procedure

- (a) The floor supervisor sends the completed Weekly Stores List to the Executive Housekeeper for approval.

## DATE:

98

- (b) The Executive Housekeeper thoroughly scrutinises the Weekly Stores List to see that no item is over-ordered. This is where she can exercise cost control as each item requisitioned costs and will be charged to the Housekeeping Department. She signs the Weekly Stores List in approval.
- (c) She hands the List to the Control Desk attendant who fills a Stores Requisition Form (Fig. 9.5) in duplicate. The original is meant for the store while the copy remains in the Requisition Forms Book for record.
- (d) The Executive Housekeeper signs the Store Requisition Forms.
- (e) The Floor Supervisor designates a room attendant or houseman for requisitioning duties from the General Store on the allotted day.
- (f) The floor representative and storekeeper confirm that the items tally with the Requisition Form and both sign in acknowledgement. Sometimes the General Store may not have items in stock and will mention it in the Requisition Form to claim when those items are available.
- (g) The supplies are brought to the floor pantry and the Floor Supervisor checks the items against the Weekly Stores List.
- (h) Weekly Stores Lists are presented at the end of each month to the Executive Housekeeper for control and future planning.

| Stores Requisition   | Stores Requisition   | Stores Requisition   |

## Preparing a Room Report

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To help the reader learn the importance of a Room Report and how it is prepared.

## INTRODUCTION

The Room Report (Fig. 10.1) is a document that confirms the occupancy of rooms in a given shift. The procedure to prepare a room report is followed in every shift as a check on unauthorised room occupancies or inadvertent mistakes in recording room occupancies by the front office. This is an essential task to ensure rooms are available for sale. The Floor Supervisor is the best person to physically confirm room occupancy as she has access to all the guest rooms on her allotted floor. She performs this task to enable the front office staff tally her findings with their room rack, which lists registered guests by room number. In case of a discrepancy, the receptionist sends a bell boy to make another physical verification to re-confirm the room status.

## THEROOMREPORT

The floor supervisor prepares the Room Report in triplicate. The original is meant for the front office, the duplicate for the auditor who calculates expected revenues, and the triplicate for the housekeeping records. The Floor Supervisor may delegate this task to a room attendant. She then sends the report to the Housekeeping Control Desk Supervisor who compiles a consolidated list of all floors.

The Room Report is basically a list of room numbers against which the floor supervisor indicates the occupancy status by prescribed occupancy codes (Fig. 10.2). The codes may vary in each hotel but the basic information and intention is the same. The Floor Supervisor physically enters each room on the floor with her master key following the entry procedure discussed later. Once in the

room she ascertains the number of guests by three methods: (1) by noticing the number of beds used; (2) by seeing the number of bath towels used; and (3) by observing the types of guest clothes hung in the wardrobe. The first check normally confirms occupancy. She will obviously not enter rooms with a 'Do-not-Disturb' sign.

## Room Report

Fig. 10.1

## OCCUPANCY CODES

An explanation of the codes (Fig. 10.2) will be useful here:

Occupied: This status shows that a guest has checked into the room and is staying in the hotel. The signs of occupancy are beds that have been used, baggage on the baggage rack, clothes in the wardrobe, room service trays that are not cleared, bath towels that have been used and personal effects in the room and bathroom.

Vacant: This room is empty and ready for sale.

DND: This is a sign displayed either by a door knob card or a lit DND light beside the door facing the corridor. Obviously the guest cannot be disturbed and therefore, one is not able to verify the occupancy status of the room.

Luggage in Room but not Used: This code may seem odd. There are guests who may lease a room but stay with friends and relatives in the city. The luggage is not opened and the bed is not used. The danger is that the guest may have skipped without paying the room bill and has left the baggage as a decoy.

Under Repair: Indicates that the room is declared unsuitable for occupancy till repairs in the room are set right. This is a temporary situation where the room can be released in a short time.

Occupied, but no Luggage: These rooms show that the beds and bath linen have been used in spite of no guest luggage. There are several possibilities in such rooms:

- 1. It is a departure room.
- 2. The night manager may have used the room to rest.
- 3. Staff may have used the room without permission.
- 4. A guest with light luggage may have checked out without paying the bill.

Scanty Baggage: A room with light luggage. This can be a potential skipper (a person who may depart without paying the bill).

Out-of-Order: A room on a long-term maintenance requirement and therefore, unsuitable for sale.

Double Lock: A double lock is a security feature that cannot be opened with a master key. The room certainly shows occupancy but not the number of people inside.

Not Cleared: A departure room unprepared for sale.

## IMMEDIATE REPORTABLE MATTERS

In addition to the routine report, the floor supervisor immediately reports certain unusual observations to her superiors who will alert the Lobby Manager, Security Officer or even the General Manager based on the seriousness. Such reportable matters are discussed below:

Pets: Hotels usually do not permit pets in guest rooms. They have arrangements with kennels for the safekeeping of pets of guests. But the situation becomes critical when there are unusual pets like a boa constrictor (a species of snake), crocodile or a monkey!

Drugs: Illegal items like drugs in rooms are a serious criminal matter. Tell-tale signs of drugs are syringes, odd smell in the room, small burners, pouches of white powder, and so on.

103

Arms: In a world engulfed with terrorism, the presence of arms, bombs and explosive materials is dangerous. Such matters need to be reported immediately.

Gambling: Generally, gambling is an illegal pursuit unless establishments like casinos have licences for such activities. Rooms showing evidence of gambling is a reportable matter and requires security interventions.

Theft: Housekeeping personnel are additional 'security eyes' of the property. Housekeeping personnel on floors come into contact with the private aspects of a guests stay. Floor supervisors and room attendants are trained to look out for missing hotel property in rooms. Normal things that go missing are wall pictures, bathrobes, towels, bathroom slippers and clothes hangers. Hotels permit guests often to take away vanity sets in bathrooms, soaps, stationery, matchboxes, and laundry bags. However, floor personnel should remain aware of missing items in a room and should report the matter to the control desk.

Damage: The above-mentioned principles would also apply to damaged hotel property. The hotel authority has the right to recover amounts for damages to hotel property.

Medical Emergency: Medical emergencies of guests are another serious issue which is to be attended. Guests can be threatened by medical conditions any time such as heart attack, allergic attacks, and so on.  The hotel personnel must take into consideration such things and provide aid when such medical emergencies arise.

Children: Kids left unattended in a guest room sometimes pose as a risk. A room attendant does not leave the room till the parent or guardian is located and brought back.

## INTRODUCTION

In addition to routine functions explained in the earlier lesson, the Floor Supervisor has other periodic duties to accomplish. This may be done weekly, monthly, or biannually.

## PERIODIC DUTIES OF A FLOOR SUPERVISOR

## Weekly Cleaning Procedure

The Floor Supervisor rotates room attendants and housemen to accomplish certain cleaning chores that are time-consuming and labour intensive. These tasks may not be daily routine tasks but are done at least once a week:

- 1. Polishing brassware in rooms
- 2. Scrubbing bathroom tiles that have stubborn stains
- 3. Pest control
- 4. Unhooking translucent day curtains that may gather dust over time and sending them for laundering. The curtains brought down will require a replacement to be hooked on
- 5. Polishing wooden furniture
- 6. Scrubbing shower curtains that have stubborn stains
- 7. Cleaning window panes and window sills. A special crew will clean window panes from outside on a biannual or annual basis
- 8. Scrubbing balconies and terraces

<!-- image -->

- 9. Vacuuming carpets under heavy furniture
- 10. Vacuuming upholstered furniture
- 11. Changing paper underliners in guest closets and drawers
- 12. Recycling potted plants with those in the nursery
- 13. Grouting bathroom tiles
- 14. Dusting ceiling vents and louvres

## Rooms Under Repair

The Executive Housekeeper has a preventive maintenance cycle for all rooms such as painting, masonry work, etc. executed by the Maintenance Department. The  Floor  Supervisor  follows  certain  procedures  as follows:

- 1. Inform the Housekeeping Control Desk to advise front office not to sell rooms taken under major repair.
- 2. Call the tailor from the linen room to dismantle the curtains and send them for storage at the linen room.
- 3. Send lampshades, bed covers, skirting, linen, guest supplies, etc. to the floor linen room for storage.
- 4. Cover the telephone instrument/s with polythene and disconnect it.
- 5. Close inlet valves of taps and water closets.
- 6. Call the audio-visual technician to disconnect the televisions/radios/ music systems and store them in the music room.
- 7. Send upholstered furniture to the upholstery yard for mending or shampoo.

<!-- image -->

- 8. Call the horticulturist to collect indoor plants for storage at the nursery.
- 9. Remove all dresser and wardrobe drawers and store them in the floor linen room.
- 10. Roll up carpets and send them to the upholstery yard for shampooing.
- 11. Cover remaining furniture and fixtures with polythene sheets or condemned bed sheets.

Note: All items must be labelled with the room number for identification when it is time to replace them.

## Guest Loan Items

The Floor Supervisor will periodically loan items to guests on request, as the extra service provided by the hotel. Some hotels may charge for these items. Such items are hand iron, hairdryer, ironing board, cribs, sewing kits, rollaway beds, voltage adaptors, hot water bottles, extra pillows, orthopaedic mattress, extra blankets, vanity sets, Qibla (compass for direction to Mecca for Muslim prayers), and so on.

These items need to be controlled carefully as they cost and the supervisor will be held accountable for them. Each Floor Supervisor is issued a stock of these items stored in the floor linen room. The par stock is based on historical demand for these items. The hazards associated with loaning these items are:

- Theft
- Damage
- Misplacement
- Misuse

The Floor Supervisor will maintain a Guest Loan Register (Fig. 11.1) as a control measure.

<!-- image -->

Guest Loan Register

The supervisor controls the movement of these items and ensures their recovery before she ends her shift. Should the guest wish to retain the item beyond the shift, the supervisor mentions this in the log book for the next shift supervisor to recover. The control features in the register has the date, guest name and the room number. The call and delivery times are there to ascertain how promptly the guest request was serviced. The persons receiving and recovering the items are held responsible for the safe return of the item to the floor linen room. The last column 'Comments' gives the status of the item. If damaged, the floor supervisor can advise the Control Desk who may charge the damage to the guest folio. For hotels who charge for this service, the period of usage delivery is informed to the front office cashier who will enter the charge in the guest folio. Some hotels charge by the hour and some levy a fixed charge. These services require close co-ordination with the Control Desk who advises the front office cashier of such charges.

## INVENTORY OF GUEST SUPPLIES

Another important concern for a floor supervisor is the control of guest supplies. Every guest room has a standard number of items and therefore, it is easy to calculate the demand for such items on a daily basis. Figure 11.2 gives the standard list of guest supplies in a luxury hotel:

| Room                                                                                   | Bathroom                                                                                                                      |

List of Guest Supplies

The variable element is occupancy. The supervisor will need to establish a par stock of each item based on historical occupancy in various seasons. Peak seasons will need higher par stocks while low seasons will need less. The supervisor may realise that some items like ashtrays, room service menus, do-not-disturb signs, directories, etc. have a longer room life than other consumables. She must maintain appropriate par stocks in the floor linen room and a par on each maid's cart. She would know exactly the consumption of each cart on a daily basis. She maintains these records in a Guest Supplies Consumption Register (Fig. 11.3).

Fig. 11.3

Guest Supplies Consumption Register

The Floor Supervisor requisitions supplies from the general stores.

## SPRING CLEANING PROCEDURE

Spring cleaning is a term used for the complete cleaning of a room not usually carried out as part of daily routine. It is done at a time when occupancies are low since it is time-consuming. The procedure is explained below.

- 1. The Front Office is notified to declare the rooms 'not for sale'. They negotiate a date for the release of the rooms which must be honoured by housekeeping as it involves revenue generation.

## Other Floor Procedures

- 2. The room is 'stripped' of linen, guest amenities and decorative items.
- 3. Curtains are unhooked and sent to the laundry for dry-cleaning.
- 4. The room service is directed to empty the mini-bar and tea stations.
- 5. Carpets are rolled or covered with dust sheet.
- 6. Broken or damaged furniture is sent to the furniture yard for re-upholstery, carpentry work, shampooing of upholstery or lacquering.
- 7. The room is handed to the maintenance department for tasks like painting, carpentry work, electrical work and any other engineering work.
- 8. Once the maintenance department completes the work and hands over the room to housekeeping, the first step is to air the room for any residual smells of paints and polishes.
- 9. The carpet is re-laid and shampooed.
- 10. Permanent fixtures are cleaned/polished.
- 11. Furniture is re-installed.
- 12. The bathroom is cleaned and the grouting is cleaned or steamed.
- 13. Curtains are fixed.
- 14. Beds are made with fresh sheets.
- 15. Accessories and guest amenities are put back.
- 16. The room service is called to restock the mini-bar, glassware and tea station.
- 17. The floor supervisor makes a final check before releasing the room to front office for sale.

## GUESTROOM INSPECTION

One of the key responsibilities of a floor supervisor is to conduct an inspection of each guest room cleaned by a room attendant. This task ensures the standards of quality in cleanliness, maintenance and presentation of the hotel. A room is ready for sale after it has been inspected by the supervisor. There are some scientific principles applied to ensure that the inspection is thorough:

- 1. The supervisor is aided by a checklist. (Figure 11.4 shows an Inspection Checklist.)
- 2. The supervisor starts in a clockwise direction (or anticlockwise as per the policy of the hotel).
- 3. She goes from ceiling to floor direction.

4.

She makes a final look around after the inspection.

- 5. She inspects the bedroom first and then the bathroom following the same principles of inspection for the bathroom as for the bedroom given above.

In addition, housekeepers over years of experience have certain pet areas that act as a 'litmus test' for the standard of cleanliness undertaken. Housekeeping has devised its own system of running white cloth in the difficult areas to capture dust tell-tales. These areas gather dust over time for a lack of cleaning. They are listed below:

## Bedrooms

- Top of clothes hangers
- Interiors of cupboards
- Interiors of drawers
- Top of picture frames
- Grills of air conditioners and radiators

<!-- image -->

- Corners of ceilings for cobwebs
- Carpet area behind free standing furniture
- Area between the bed and side-table
- Under table lamps
- Under beds
- Top of door frames
- Window sills hidden by curtains
- Balcony furniture and railing

## Bathrooms

- Behind the toilet bowl
- Under the sink
- Faucet filters
- Air vents
- Exhaust vents

VIP rooms are often inspected by the Assistant Housekeeper or the Executive Housekeeper.

<!-- image -->

## HANDLINGARRIVAL OF VIP GUESTS

The acronym VIP stands for 'Very Important Person'. Each hotel has its own list of VIPs, which can include Heads of State, Ambassadors, Ministers, Corporate CEOs and Presidents or Vice Presidents of Companies, famous sports personalities, film celebrities, frequent guests, travel agents, travel writers, tour leaders, travel or trade senior executive, senior executives of reputed companies, and so on. In case of arrival of a VIP, the following procedure should be followed:

- Front Office informs Housekeeping about VIP arrival and rooms allotted, which are displayed on the Housekeeping Control Desk Board. These rooms are mentioned at the shift briefing.
- The Executive Housekeeper or Assistant Housekeeper personally checks the VIP rooms.
- The room service installs a full or partial bar of alcoholic drinks and fruit juices.
- The room service also places fruit baskets and cookies, chocolates and petits fours.
- The flower shop arranges for a bouquet.
- Bathrooms are equipped with vanity sets (shampoos, body lotion, Eau de Toilette, disposable shaving razor, shaving cream, comb, bath salts, disposable toothbrush and toothpaste, herbal soaps, etc.); towelled bathrobes, bath slippers, extra pillows and blankets.
- Personalised stationery, notepads and matchboxes.
- Some hotels give a small gift as a memento.

## CLOSING DOWN THE SHIFT

The Floor Supervisor is responsible for closing the shift. For this, she has to ensure the following from the room attendants and housemen:

- Empty the garbage bags of the housekeeping carts into a garbage receptacle.
- Empty the bags of used linen of the housekeeping cart into the linen hamper and ensure that they are sent to the laundry (either by the laundry chute or shuttled by the mobile hamper).
- Remove the maid's carts and damp wipe it.
- Empty the vacuum cleaner bags and replace.
- Clean the machine using a damp cloth and remove residual fluff from the vacuum brushes.
- Wash toilet brushes weekly for ten minutes in hot water and flush daily in toilet flush.
- Rinse mops in hot water and neutral detergent and hang to dry.
- Cleanse mop buckets regularly.
- Remove mop threads from rollers and clean them.
- Tidy the pantry by stacking items in their appropriate places.
- Mop the floor.
- Lock the Floor Pantry and hand over the keys to the control desk for the next shift.
- Sign off the shift.

## GUEST ROOM CLEANING PROCEDURES

<!-- image -->

## Layout of a Guest Room

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To introduce the reader to a typical guest room and help him/her understand its layout, features, and supplies.

## INTRODUCTION

The purpose of a hotel, since the early inns, is  to provide accommodation to travellers, or as clichéd is 'a home away from home'. It is important that a future housekeeping professional is thoroughly familiar with the guest room as its maintenance and cleanliness is one of his/her  major  responsibilities.  Guest  rooms generate over 50 per cent revenue for the hotel, and in some cases, it is the only source of revenue for the hotel without food and beverage operations.

Investors, therefore, put in a great deal of money

<!-- image -->

into creating rooms. The common belief is that the more rooms are there in a hotel, the better it is for business economics. It is for this reason that we find some hotels that have over 6000 rooms. The future indicates either mega hotels with thousands of rooms or small boutique hotels with a maximum of 100 rooms.

## TYPES OF GUEST ROOM

We have seen the different types of rooms in hotels and available to the traveller in Part 1 of Lesson 4, 'Types of Rooms.' The most sensible type of rooms are the twin rooms (having two single beds), because the two rooms can be used as single, double or triple rooms with an additional rollaway bed. Luxury hotels prefer to provide two queen-sized double beds. It however, does not give the flexibility to be used as two single beds for two unrelated travellers in a group. Luxury hotels provide

two queen-sized beds to make each person's stay more comfortable (as shown in the picture alongside).

Another type of room is the suite which is a composite of two rooms, one room acting as a living-cum-dining room while the other as the bedroom. Residential suites also provide kitchenettes (as shown below).

The room attendant will possibly have a few suites in  his/her  charge  to  clean  along  with  twin  or  double rooms. This brings with it the complexities of cleaning and productivity.

## FEATURES IN A TYPICAL ROOM

## Beds

As shown in the schematic diagram below (not drawn to scale but representative only), a typical room will have a bed or beds that have two elements:

- (i) Separate 1  by 4  mattresses depending on the type of luxury the hotel wishes to provide.
- (ii) The cot which is the form on which mattresses are set.

This gives the room attendant flexibility to move the bed around especially when preparing it and cleaning beneath it. It is prudent to fix the headboard to the wall enabling the room attendant to reach the head side of

<!-- image -->

the bed as well as the headboard for cleaning purposes. The owner of the hotel can change the headboard during major renovations without having to change the bed.

## Layout of a Guest Room

## Bedside Table

The bedside table has a table lamp for reading; a bedside telephone; a shelf which has a copy of Bible, Koran or Gita; a bedstead lamp; directories; and other amenities like alarm clocks, etc. The bedside table often has a console atop it with electrical connections to control all the lights in a room and the power to the television set. Modern technology has provided electronic remote controls doing away with electrical connection to the console, leaving this piece of furniture as bedside tables only.

## Lighting System

It is important at this stage to be familiar with the lighting system in a typical room. The room will have an entrance light in the passage as one enters the room; table lamps on either side of the bed, (wall or headboard mounted behind the bed); one standing lamp at the corner of the room; mirror light for the dresser; wall mounted lights especially  in  large  rooms  and  suites;  and  floor  night lamps for those who do not like to sleep in the dark. The standard bulb power for bedside tables is 60 watts while the standard lamp and dresser light has a bulb of 100 watts. Bathrooms have a neon mirror light and a ceiling spot light with a normal bulb.

<!-- image -->

## Luggage Rack

The luggage rack comes in two types. The fixed wooden feature that has brass strips (see picture) so as not to damage the wood, and the foldable rack that can be stored in the wardrobe when not in use. The wooden rack is sturdier and preferred by hotels that have international travellers with heavy baggage. The housekeeping can keep a few foldable ones in the floor linen room in case a guest requires additional storage.

<!-- image -->

## Wardrobe

The wardrobe is usually found at the entrance passage way (see schematic layout). The wardrobe is the prime storage space in the room for guest belongings, and additional blankets and pillows. It has

a section to hang long clothes like dresses and gowns; shelves for extra pillows and blankets and drawers for  clothing  accessories.  Superior  hotels  provide room safety boxes that are installed in the wardrobe for additional security. The wardrobe normally has a full length mirror for guests to use just as they leave the room. The guest will find the following amenities inside  the  wardrobe:  laundry  lists;  bath  slippers, shoeshine tag; hangers; bathrobe; extra pillows and blankets. Some wardrobes have internal lighting so that the articles in the cupboard can be seen clearly.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Dresser

The dresser is a multipurpose piece of furniture. It has a base that acts as a dresser as well as the writing desk. Above it is mounted a mirror or a three-panelled one (in picture). The dresser has drawers where the guest will find guest stationery and sewing kits. On the top, the dresser will  display  menu  cards,  guest  comment  forms  and  other  internal advertisement material.

## Coffee Table and Chairs

The room is complete with a coffee table and two chairs. This is where magazines are displayed and where the guest can eat his/her meals ordered from the room service. It is the place where the guest can entertain his/her visitors.

## Garden Furniture

Many hotels have balconies, terrace gardens and patios. They provide garden furniture for these areas that can resist external temperatures and rain. A room attendant will have to maintain them as well. Chalet type of structures may provide verandas that will have seating appropriate for outdoor purposes. In hotels, with this feature, guests may want to  eat  their  room  service  meals  outdoors  and  enjoy  the  views  and ambience that is provided.

## BATHROOM

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The room attendant has to be familiar with the bathroom as it is an intimate part of a guest room. The bathroom will be normally found off the entrance passageway. A typical bathroom of a luxury hotel will have a bathtub with a shower curtain; counter where the sink is mounted that serves the place to display vanity sets, guest toiletries, merchandising material and perhaps a flower arrangement; a water closet; and rods for bath towels, face towels and hand towels.

Deluxe hotels may provide shower trays as well, while economy hotels will do away with bath tubs due to space restrictions and provide shower trays instead. Some budget hotels may just provide a shower with a shower curtain.

<!-- image -->

At this point it is important for the room attendant to know the difference between various terms used for bathing: a ' bath ' provides a bath tub to immerse the body, whereas a ' shower ' is

## Layout of a Guest Room

an alcove where a person bathes standing under a shower fountain. A ' shower tray ' is an enclosed cubicle with a shower fountain. Modern luxury hotels provide a 'Jacuzzi' which is a tub with water-massage jets.

This completes the guest room which is a composite of  a  bedroom  and  bathroom  with  perhaps  balconies, patios, terraces and verandas based on the design of the property. A shower tray is also the responsibility of the room attendant.

## GUIDELINES TO SELECT GUEST ROOM FURNITURE

## Ease of Maintenance

Furniture should be easy to clean and kept spotless. The attendant should be able to reach all the corners and gaps in furniture joints where dust and debris can accumulate. This factor becomes especially critical in a quick turnaround hotel.

## Lightweight

Most furniture must be easy to move around so that one can clean the surfaces below and around it. Some heavyweight furniture are unavoidable like cots or TV cabinets in which case it is better to buy them with castors for easy manoeuverability.

## Replaceability

Like everything else, furniture is bound to deplete with the passage of time. It is recommended to buy such furniture that can be easily substituted.

## Multipurpose

It is best to buy furniture that can have many uses like the writing table that can double up as a dresser. Hence, it can be positioned in front of the mirror. The wardrobe can have multi-sections and shelves to hang clothes or store folded clothes, place to store blankets and counterpanes, a shelf to house the safety deposit box and drawers for small items.

## Cost

This factor is paramount as furniture is bought in volume resulting in high capital cost to the investors. Furniture must be elegant yet cost efficient.

## Durability

Naturally we would like the furniture to last long since it is expensive. It should be able to withstand daily use. Durability depends on the type of wood used; the number of joints infused; the kind of adhesive used; long-lasting hinges, locks, handles, draw railings, etc.; protective varnishing; and cushions with washable covers.

## Guest Comfort

It is every hotelier's desire to provide his or her guest a safe and comfortable stay. Special care is taken in selecting mattresses, pillows, ergo-friendly furniture with rounded edges to prevent any kind of damage.

An executive housekeeper is usually trained in the sources from where to get good furniture. She is able to identify good construction and check the attributes from the point of her staff servicing them.

## Rules on a Guest Floor

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## INTRODUCTION

Room attendants must follow some floor rules that project professionalism and efficiency ensuring least inconvenience to guests. The floor and rooms are quite private and personal for guests and so they are concerned about the people who frequent these places. The guests trust the room attendants who are privy to their rooms and belongings. The room attendant is issued the master keys by the Desk Control Supervisor. He/She signs for this facility and therefore, becomes responsible for its safekeeping. The issuing of the master key to the room attendant also signifies the fact that trust has been placed on him/her by both the management and guest to access guest floors and rooms.

## RULES ON A GUEST FLOOR

To uphold this  trust,  the  following  rules  must  be  strictly observed on the floor:

- 1. Room Attendants must always be in uniform and should appear properly groomed when entering the floor as this reflects on the image of the property.
- 2. They should reach the floor by the service elevator and enter the floor through the service entrance. The guest elevators are meant for guests only.
- 3. Speech among the floor staff must be restricted to the minimum. In case communication is necessary, this must be done in low tones even when guests are not in sight. It is possible some guests are asleep and want no disturbance.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Unnecessary movements like running or jumping should be avoided. Such movements can disturb guests in the room.
- 5. The passageway must be kept free of equipment, trays or trolleys. Maid's carts are kept along the wall (as shown in the picture). Used room service trays are stored along the wall outside the door for pick-up by room service staff.
- 6. Room attendants may enter only those rooms that are allotted to them. They are not permitted to enter other rooms as a precaution towards security and accountability.
- 7. Guest room doors must be kept wide open when servicing a room. This notifies the supervisor as to which room is being cleaned and where to find the room attendant. It is also a protection of the room attendant from undesirable guests.
- 8. When speaking to a guest in the room for any reason, the room attendant should stand at the doorway and not inside the room, which is viewed as an infringement of the guest ' s privacy.
- 9. The floor telephone must be attended to promptly. Continuous ringing of a phone can be irksome to guests in the neighbouring rooms.
- 10. Room attendants must greet all guests with a smile, according to the time of the day. It is a professional courtesy and creates a friendly environment on the floor.
- 11. Staff must be helpful and should readily give information about hotel services, when requested. Misinformation can lead to dissatisfaction of the guests.
- 12. Housekeeping staff must be alert to guest movements and report anybody supicious on the floor, to the floor supervisor and ultimately the security.
- 13. The guest is always right. Arguing with a guest is prohibited. Unreasonable guests may be referred to the floor supervisor.
- 14. It is prohibited to enter rooms with a ' Do-not-Disturb ' (DND) sign. The DND feature is provided by the hotels worldwide to permit guests to choose to rest without disturbance. Guests may have checked in late or getting over jet lag. This particularly applies to airline crews who check in at odd hours especially when they have been on international flights.
- 15. If a DND sign is on for a long time, this may be reported to the floor supervisor who will take further decisions and actions. Long DND signs, especially those that span over two shifts, are unusual. A guest could be sick and in need of medical help. There have been many cases of death.
- 16. If the guest returns when the room is being cleaned, the room attendant may ask the guest if he/she could continue or come later.
- 17. In spite of following the room entry procedure, if the guest is found asleep or awake, one should apologise and quickly withdraw and shut the door softly. Sometimes the room attendant may hear the sound of the shower in the bathroom indicating the reason for the guest not attending to the door knock.
- 18. Attendants must always follow the procedure of entering a room even if the room is declared vacant. The procedure includes knocking the door and announcing 'Housekeeping' which is to be repeated after 15 seconds if there is no reply. This is required, especially in busy hotels that have frequent check-ins. The status of an arrival is known to the room attendant much later than the event.

- 19. Attendants must always accompany the room service staff when they are clearing trays, and maintenance staff when they are attending to repairs in the room. The room attendant is the custodian of the rooms allotted to him/her and that he/she will be held accountable for any property of the guest or hotel missing from the room.
- 20. Attendants should not open the room for any unauthorised personnel. Resident guests are expected to have their own keys. Other guests should not enter at any cost.
- 21. It is important to report any suspicious articles like arms and drugs to the floor supervisor who may call the security for further inspection.
- 22. Housekeeping personnel  cannot  make  external  calls  from  guest  rooms  or  the  floor telephone.
- 23. It is important for security reasons for the room attendants to try and familiarise themselves with the faces of resident guests as a control measure. While this may always not be possible, it is a good practice.
- 24. Garbage and soiled linen must be dumped in the designated hampers of the maid's cart. Such items must be away from the guest view.
- 25. Caution guests of wet floors in the corridors (if uncarpeted) or in the room. The correct practice is to put 'Wet Floor' signs as a precaution.
- 26. Guest belongings found in departure rooms should be immediately reported to the floor supervisor. He/she will check if the guests have checked out or are still paying their bills with the front office cashier. If the guests have checked out, then the floor supervisor will follow the Lost and Found procedure.
- 27. The room attendant must return the master key to the Desk Control Supervisor at the end of the shift.
- 28. Room attendants are generally not supposed to accept gifts or tips from guests. However, sometimes a guest may be offended with a refusal in which case the gift must be mentioned to the floor supervisor who will sign off a gate pass to permit an employee to take it out of the hotel.

## The Maid's Cart

<!-- image -->

To familiarise the reader with the maid's cart which is the single most

## INTRODUCTION

The maid's cart is a trolley meant to stock a given number of linen, supplies and equipment to service an allotted number of rooms. Each maid, after receiving her room assignment, should  check  her  supplies  against  a  standard  checklist to  avoid  needless  trips. The  maid  is  responsible  for  the condition, cleanliness and appearance of her cart.

## DESIGN OF A MAID'S CART

<!-- image -->

The lower shelf of the cart is used to carry heavier items like mattress protectors, bed sheets and night spreads. The middle and top shelves stock pillow slips and bath linen. Linen will include:

| Linen Items         | Stocking Standards          | Standard Dimensions   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Night spreads       | 1 each per bed              | 24"  108"             |
| Bed sheets          | 2 each per bed              | 24"  108"             |
| Pillow cases        | 2 each per bed              | 24"  32"              |

- Deodoriser
- Room Freshener
- Vim
- Sanifresh
- Liquid Soap
- Naphthalene Balls
- Anol

These supplies are procured by the room attendant from the floor linen room. After stocking the cart, the room attendant proceeds to the section of rooms on the floor that are assigned to her. Maid ' s carts are placed along the wall of the corridor on the side of the room to be serviced. The cart should be positioned so as to service a minimum of two rooms to minimise trips to the cart and thereby reduce the fatigue factor of room attendants.

Maid's carts come in different materials-wood, metal, plastic and rubber. When selecting maid ' s carts, consideration is given to it being lightweight to ensure easy mobility by the maid. Heavy carts also pucker corridor carpets. In fact, when purchasing the cart, due consideration is given to the built of the housekeeping staff in a country. The wheels of the cart must be of sturdy construction and should be oiled well periodically to ensure smooth movement. The average size of wheels for good manoeuverability is 8 inches. The carts can range in dimensions as given in Table 14.2.

## INTRODUCTION

Prior to reporting on a floor, the room attendant is allotted a list of rooms with the status of each given by the front-office receptionist. This is given to her at the time of briefing by the floor supervisor. The floor supervisor controls the output with the Daily Work Report as given in Fig. 15.1.

The room attendant checks the status of rooms allotted to her on a checklist. She prioritises the rooms to be attended to according to occupancy codes. First she should attend to checkout rooms to prepare them for sale. This would also apply to vacant rooms which are clean but need a quick top-up service to prepare for sale. She would next attend to those rooms with the tag 'Clean my Room' left by resident guests when they leave the room for the day. She would attend to the occupied rooms and stayover rooms last. She must avoid the rooms with a 'Do-not-Disturb' or 'Privacy Please' sign displayed.

## PROCEDURE FOR CHECKING A ROOM

Given below is a step-by-step procedure for checking a room:

## Entering the Room

- 1. Knock on the door with the knuckles and not with an object, announcing 'Housekeeping.'
- 2. If  there  is  no  answer,  after  ten  seconds  knock  the  door  the  second  time  announcing 'Housekeeping.'
- 3. If there is still no answer, use the master key to open the door announcing 'Housekeeping' and knocking the door when ajar. If someone is sleeping, quietly withdraw noting the room as DND on the checklist. If the guest is awake politely ask if she can clean the room or come later. When relatively sure that there is no occupant, open the door wide and hang the door sign 'Housekeeping Cleaning Room' on the door knob/handle.
- 4. Position the maid's cart along the corridor wall adjacent to the room being serviced to keep the passage free.
- 5. Switch off the room air conditioner or heating. Draw all curtains and open all windows to air the room.
- 6. Switch all the lights in the room to ascertain if any bulbs are fused.

## Guest Belonging Check

- 7. Check departure rooms for Guest Lost and Found items and report them immediately to the Control Desk.
- 8. Pick guest clothes and hang them in the wardrobe in occupied rooms.
- 9. Empty all ashtrays into a wastepaper basket in the room. Collect other loose trash on tables and floors and throw them in the wastepaper basket checking for guest belongings.
- 10. Check wastepaper baskets for guest's belongings before emptying them into the trash bag of the maid's cart.
- 11. Collect all loose papers and magazines and stack them neatly on the desk.
- 12. Contact the laundry for pick-up in case laundry bags with guest laundry are noticed.

## Maintenance Check

The room attendant has to check the room for maintenance requirements and report the same to the Control Desk. He will enter such maintenance requirements in the room checklist. The checks included in maintenance check are given in Fig. 15.2.

## MAKING THE BED

Bed making requires technical expertise in a hotel because of the sheer volume of beds to be made in a given shift. If a room attendant has to prepare 16-20 rooms, as per the prevalent standards, in a shift, he has potentially 32-40 beds to make. This is in addition to cleaning the rooms and bathrooms. It is here that his productivity is determined. Given below are the detailed steps for making a bed:

- 1. Pull the bed away from the headboard by tugging the bed from the foot of the bed. All the beds in hotels are mounted on wheels for easy manoeuverability. Check under the cot for trash or guest belongings.
- 2. Remove all soiled linen from the bed. Shake them out for any guest articles that may be misplaced in the folds.
- 3. Deposit the soiled linen in the linen hamper of the maid's cart.

- 4. Check the mattress protector  for  any  stains  or spoilage. If so, change with a fresh one. If not, invert mattresses over-side and end-to-end to ensure even use, every alternate day. Adjust the skirting so that they fall evenly on the floor.
- 5. Shake out the mattress protector and spread it again on the mattress. Change the protector if soiled or smelling.
- 6. Clean the headboard with a feather duster.

<!-- image -->

- 7. Open out a fresh lower sheet ensuring it is centred for  even  distribution  on  either  side  and  tuck  it securely at the head, sides and at the foot of the bed.
- 8. Mitre the corners following the sequence shown in the pictures below.

## Cleaning a Room

- 9. Open out the fresh top sheet wrong-side up and distribute it  evenly on the lower sheet. Ensure that the laundry crease is in the same line as the inner sheet for even distribution. The sheet hem must be evenly pulled up to the headboard. Tuck this sheet at the footboard.
- 10. Open out the blanket and distribute it 10 centimetres lower than the top sheet and distribute it evenly on the top sheet using the crease as described earlier for even distribution.  Ensure  that  the  blanket  labels  are  at  the foot of the bed. Pull the blanket eight inches from the headboard to position the pillows and create a fold for the guest to slide in.

<!-- image -->

- 11. Fold the top sheet at the head of the bed, over the blanket and fold the blanket and top sheet once again.
- 12. The blanket and the top sheet are tucked uniformly under the mattress on both sides and that the corners at the foot of the bed are mitered.

<!-- image -->

- 13. Fold the corner of the blanket and top sheet as shown in the picture for the guest to easily slide into the bed. (Some hotels will do this only during turndown service)

- 14. Cover the pillows with fresh pillow covers. Fluff the pillow and even out pillow covers to look full, neat and tidy. Since pillow slips are usually larger than the pillow, the excess slip should be neatly folded downward. The side of the pillow which has the fold should be away from guest view. In the turn-down service, a breakfast knob is placed on the pillow.
- 15. Cover the completed bed with a bed spread ensuring it is right side up and falling evenly all around the bed to

- 17. Push the bed back towards the headboard ensuring that it is aligned.
- 18. Put spare blankets (upon guest's request) in plastic covers and store in the top shelf or lower shelf of the wardrobe in the guest room. The blankets are folded in a manner where the hotel logo is at the top.

## The Dirty Dozen

Certain areas in a room or bathroom elude the room attendant's attention and dust tends to accumulate in these areas. Such areas are normally hidden from a guest's eye. However, the cleanliness of these areas shows the standard of cleaning of the hotel. Experience shows that the following areas are overlooked and appropriately called the 'The Dirty Dozen.' They are:

- 1. The top of door edges and the ceiling
- 2. Air-conditioning ducts and diffuser grills
- 3. Under bathroom counters and grab bar
- 4. Areas beneath the dresser table
- 5. Behind the WC bowl and the S-trap
- 6. In the toilet roll niche
- 7. Faucet nozzle filter
- 8. Toilet vents
- 9. Top of picture frames
- 10. Headboard
- 11. Rear surface of doors
- 12. Interior surfaces of drawers

## Turn-Down Service

Most of the room cleaning is done in the morning and afternoon shift, the exception being rooms with a 'Do-not-Disturb' sign. Such rooms are normally occupied by late night/early morning arrivals,

especially crews. All occupied rooms, however, require an evening turn-down service to prepare the room for the night.

The room attendant will follow the procedure given below:

- 1. Knock and enter the room as per the procedure given above.
- 2. Put  all  light  switches  on  to  check  that  they  are working.
- 3. Draw heavy curtains to give privacy to guests at night.
- 4. Hang loose guest clothes in the wardrobe.
- 5. Take off the bed cover, fold it neatly and store it in the wardrobe on the top or lower shelf.
- 6. Fold one corner of the blanket to enable a guest to slide into the bed easily (picture alongside).
- 7. Place a breakfast knob card along with a rosette/chocolate, as prescribed, on the pillow (picture alongside).
- 8. Remove soiled glasses and bottles, if any. Replenish glasses and fill the water flask with drinking water (where applicable).
- 9. Empty and clean ashtrays and waste bins.

## Housekeeping Control Desk

<!-- image -->

To help the reader learn the importance of the Control Desk-its systems and procedures.

## ROLE OF THE CONTROL DESK

The Housekeeping Control Desk is the nerve centre of the entire housekeeping department. Its efficiency determines  the  effectiveness  of  the  housekeeping function. It is a focal point for the dissemination of information and communication to various points in the Housekeeping Department as well as co-ordination with  other  departments  principally  the  front-office and engineering. The location of the Control Desk is normally adjacent to the Executive Housekeeper's office so that she knows the pulse of her department.

This desk is manned 24 hours, to keep the lifeline of

housekeeping communication open 24   7. To reduce workforce and the introduction of superior telecommunication equipment, modern hotels have created common communication services between departments.

The role of the Housekeeping Control Desk is to facilitate communication to various parts of the hotel. This role is exercised in many forms:

- A large display board provides the following information to housekeeping staff:
- 1. Room numbers of groups in the house.
- 2. Room numbers of crews in the house.

- 3. Night cleaning schedule.
- 4. VIPs in the house.
- 5. Weekly cleaning schedules.
- 6. Daily roster of supervisors and staff.
- 7. Banquet function lists.
- 8. New policy announcements by the management.
- 9. Declared national holidays.
- 10. Extra items given to guests e.g. blankets, orthopaedic mattresses, etc.
- 11. Any other significant information.
- The desk control attendant bleeps pagers of floor supervisors, room attendants and housekeeping public area personnel who are issued this communication equipment. The staff is trained to reach the nearest telephone available, for example, the floor telephone located at a mid-point of a corridor (usually the guest lift foyers).  With the passage of time, two-way walkie-talkies replaced pagers. Supervisors nowadays may be issued mobile phones for such communication. Recent developments have been palm computers.
- Networked computers with maintenance and front-office  have  facilitated  real-time communication on matters of room co-ordination and maintenance.

## The role of the room attendant is to:

- Receive departure room numbers from the front office and transmit them to the appropriate floor supervisor for cleaning. Likewise, the floor supervisor informs the desk attendant once rooms are cleaned and ready for sale. The desk attendant accordingly informs the front office receptionists. This coordination is extremely vital.
- Inform housekeeping floor staff about VIPs in the house. The front office alerts the Control Desk of such arrivals. Room attendants take extra care in VIP rooms as follows: (a) special cleaning of the room; (b) equipping the rooms with additional amenities as per the policy of the management such as bathrobes, bath slippers, extra soaps, hangers, and glass tumblers, vanity sets and flower arrangements.
- Inform floor staff of groups expected and those in the house. Groups arrive and depart together, which means that the rooms are cleaned at the same time and within strict time parameters. Sometimes, the arrival of a group in a busy hotel could overlap with the departure of another. Since check-in and check-out times are the same (i.e. noon), housekeeping staff are under pressure to speedily prepare the vacated departure rooms, to allocate volume rooms to a group.
- Inform floor staff of expected and existing crews in the house. Normally airline crews are allotted rooms on the same floor. Like groups, airline crews arrive and depart at the same time. Very often the arrival of a crew and the departure of another may overlap. In such circumstances, it is important for the allotted rooms to be cleared within a short period of time. Due to the variation in international timings, it is the crew rooms that display the 'Donot-Disturb' sign at the time when other guests are out.
- Co-ordinate with the front office for the handover of clean rooms for sale to guests. After inspection, floor supervisors hand over clean rooms to the control desk. It is imperative for the desk attendant to immediately hand over clean rooms to the front office who are always under pressure to make rooms available for occupation.

- Work as the main point of contact with the resident guests of the hotel. Hotel room directories provide an extension number to guests in case they require housekeeping services. This extension come to the Control Desk (or the common communications services provider). The Control Desk attendant receives the requests of guests such as demands for extra blankets, babysitting services, etc. The Control Desk attendant transmits these requests to the concerned floor supervisor for further action.
- Control keys, including master keys, are required which can open any set of doors on a floor or elsewhere. Following keys are of significance: (a) Room Attendants are issued a bunch of keys for an allotted section of guest rooms on a floor. (b) Floor Supervisors are issued floor keys to open any guest room door on a floor. (c) The Executive Housekeeper is issued a Grand Master Key which can open any lock in the hotel. This is a vital key and carefully guarded. (d)  Storeroom keys are issued to Assistant Housekeepers or the Executive Housekeeper only, as the stores usually contain valuable inventories. The department has several stores such as the linen store, uniform store, equipment store, guest supplies store, detergent store, furniture store, floor pantries and the general housekeeping store.  Keys, especially master keys, are critical and need to be controlled rigidly lest it fall into the wrong hands opening the possibility of theft. There are several instances where hotels have had to change their locks at great cost because the master key went missing. The keys are kept in a secure cupboard or vault. A Key Control Register (discussed later) is maintained. Modern hotels have replaced it with key cards with digital authorisation to access. To ensure safety, master keys are hung on a large key ring so that the key cannot be misplaced in a pocket. Others have waist belts which are tied around the waists of the supervisors. The issue of master keys is documented in a Master Key Register, which is discussed later.

## CO-ORDINATION WITH THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT

Another vital area of co-ordination for the desk control attendant is with the Engineering Department. All room attendants and public area housemen register maintenance requests with the control desk attendant. The maintenance procedure is as follows:

- 1. The desk attendant records the maintenance request in maintenance register (Fig. 16.1), mentioning the room number, nature of complaint, and the name of the person who lodged the complaint.
- 2. She then prepares a Maintenance Slip (Fig. 16.2) in duplicate. She retains the second copy in her book and forwards the first copy to the Engineering Department.
- 3. The Engineering Department prepares a Work Order Slip (Fig. 16.3) and sends the concerned technician directly to the floor.
- 4. The room attendant or floor supervisor opens the guest room door and oversees the work till completion.
- 5. When the work is completed satisfactorily, the room attendant or floor supervisor signs the Work Order Slip to acknowledge the successful completion of the task.
- 6. The technician hands over the signed Work Order Slip to the desk attendant who enters the same in the maintenance register against the appropriate complaint earlier registered.

## Housekeeping Control Desk

The Engineering or Maintenance Department of modern hotels assigns an all-purpose engineer to handle routine maintenance. He is known as the Ken-Fixit man. He moves on guest floors with a maintenance trolley equipped with essential tools to manage all routine maintenance failures. This system has ensured a speedy attention to maintenance requirements.

The Maintenance Department also employs a preventive maintenance schedule during the year. Preventive maintenance is  a  programme of equipment upkeep so that breakdowns do not occur. The maintenance will coordinate with housekeeping to withdraw equipment in service to check them and prolong their serviceability. Housekeeping must honour the preventive maintenance  schedule  for  their  good.  The  Maintenance Department maintains a preventive maintenance record of equipment in the hotel.

<!-- image -->

Modern hotels are hooked through computer networks with the engineering department, which may translate the forms above into digital format. The communication centre may also act as the mode of communication between guests, housekeeping and engineering.

## TYPES OF REGISTERS AND FILES MAINTAINED

- 1. Register for guest messages: The  guest  message  register  (Fig.  16.4)  keeps  all  special messages/requests of guests. Messages could be requests for second service, additional blankets, fresh towels, cribs, maintenance requirements, and orthopaedic mattresses. Modern hotels maintain computerised databases of maintenance history for analysis and decisionmaking. The efficiency of the department is measured by the response times to such requests. Most hotels have supplies in the floor pantry to give immediate service. Today hotels with long corridors have satellite floor pantries on a floor in addition to the main floor pantry. This is to reduce the walking time to and fro the main pantry and also to provide quick service to the guest.

- 2. Babysitting services: The Housekeeping Department normally provides babysitters to guests. Sometimes, the room attendants offer to do this service outside their shift, to earn some extra money or qualified babysitters are requisitioned from housekeeping workforce suppliers. Requests for such services are entered into this register (Fig. 16.5) and the appropriate action is taken.

## BABYSITTING REGISTER

Fig. 16.5

Babysitting Register

- 3. Master Key Register: This register controls the issue and receipt back of master keys issued to housekeeping supervisors. The register simply has the date and time of issue; the signature of the person issuing the key and the one receiving it. The recipient of the key has to return the key at the end of the shift as part of signing off procedure at which time it is acknowledged in the register by the signature of the control desk attendant.
- 4. Room Checklists file: A floor supervisor checks each room prepared by the room attendant before the room is handed to the front office for sale. He uses the room checklist (Fig. 16.6) to guide him to look at standards set by the management, during her inspection. He ticks the items found okay and makes comments on things not upto the standards. The deficiencies will have to be rectified by the room attendant immediately. The checklist reflects the performance of the room attendant as well as the supervisor. It is handy to be referred in the event of a complaint from the guest. All room checklists are deposited by the floor Supervisors at the Control Desk and filed for a month. If a complaint about cleaning standards in a room is received, the housekeeper would know exactly which attendant was responsible and whether he checked the particular aspect under complaint.
- 5. Carpet Shampoo Register: The register has the schedule of carpet shampooing and the data indicating whether the schedule is being followed or not.
- 6. Room Occupancy Reports File: All room occupancy reports are filed. The room occupancy reports  are  important  to  the  Executive  Housekeeper  to  determine  the  level  of  workload anticipated so as to provide the necessary staff to meet the exigencies each day.
- 7. Duty Roster File: The  duty  roster  is  filed  for  information  if  required  by  any  one  in  the department.
- 8. Log Book: It is the single most important register as it is here that the instructions given to the staff of the next shift are written. This log book is referred to by the supervisors at the beginning of any shift for instructions from the previous shift. The log book will also record room numbers of difficult guests, room numbers where rollaway beds have been provided, distribution of extra supplies, etc. The log book is a ruled register to write any information necessary.

## Fig. 16.10

It may be said that due to computerisation, most offices, including the Housekeeping Office, has gone paperless. Registers may be redundant in the near future, as most data is captured on computer databases.

## LOST AND FOUND

'Lost and Found' is a term used in hotels for the articles left or misplaced by guests in a hotel. Such articles can range from jewellery, costly electronic goods, travel documents to garments. The hotel is obliged to protect such items and return them to the guests. The lost and found procedure is:

## Procedure

- 1. When a guest article is found, the housekeeping staff, usually room attendants and public area housemen, must immediately report this to their supervisor.
- 2. The supervisor (the floor supervisor or public area supervisor) immediately informs the Control Desk attendant.
- 3. The Control Desk attendant will verify with the front office cashier whether a departing resident guest is still in the process of paying his or her bill or whether he/she has checked out. If the guest is still available, he/she is contacted to hand over the article/s.
- 4. The Lobby Manager is informed about guests who may be visitors to the hotel and not resident ones, in case they contact him or her to lodge a complaint.
- 5. If the guest is not available, the Control Desk attendant fills the Lost and Found Slip (Fig. 16.11) in duplicate giving the date, time, room number, location, guest's name, if found in the room and name of the finder.
- 6. The original of the slip is attached to the article while the duplicate copy is kept in a Lost and Found Register (Fig. 16.12) which again records details as given above, including the description of the article.
- 7. The Executive Housekeeper obtains the forwarding address of the guest from the front office who would have the information in the registration card. If the guest's name is not known, as in the case of items found in public areas, then housekeeping would have to wait for the guest to claim it.
- 8. The Executive Housekeeper will call or write to the guest to either claim it or give further instructions. It is preferable to write to the guest as a record. If there is no immediate response from the guest, the housekeeper will send a written reminder.

Lost and Found Slip

Lost and Found Register

- 9. If  the  guest  returns to claim it, he/she would have to furnish details of the article before it  is  handed  to  him  or  her. The  guest's  signature  is  taken  on  the  Lost  and  Found  Slip  in acknowledgement of having received the same.
- 10. If the article has to be mailed to the forwarding address (if instructed by the guest), the article should be sent under registered post or courier with the charges made known to the guest and claimed from him/her as cash on delivery.

<!-- image -->

- 11. If the guest does not claim the article in spite of reminders, the article is kept for a specific period as prescribed by the management (usually six months) and either gifted to the finder or auctioned to the housekeeping staff. In such circumstances, the housekeeper will issue a gate pass (Fig. 16.13) to the employee for the security, so that he can take the article out of the hotel. (Employees cannot take out of the hotel any guest or hotel property without a gate pass.)

## CO-ORDINATION WITH THE FRONT OFFICE

Co-ordination with the Front Office is perhaps most critical because the sale of rooms depends on it. We are aware that room space is perishable. This means that every day a room is vacant the hotel incurs a loss of revenue. The front office agent's challenge is to lease room space back-to-back to realise its full revenue potential. This is only possible if the room is available to the front office agent to sell. Departure rooms are required to be cleaned for sale at the earliest possible time. The productivity standard ranges from 20 minutes to 40 minutes based on the size of rooms.

Such co-ordination is in the following manner:

- 1. The Front Desk informs the housekeeping Control Desk the moment a departure takes place.
- 2. The desk attendant immediately informs the floor supervisor about such departures.
- 3. The floor supervisor informs the concerned room attendant who gives priority to departure rooms to prepare them immediately for sale.
- 4. Upon completion of cleaning, the room attendant informs the floor supervisor who checks it.
- 5. She immediately informs the Housekeeping Control Desk once the room is cleared for sale.
- 6. The desk attendant informs the Front Office about the room availability.

There is immediacy about this crucial communication on which room revenues are based.

<!-- image -->

There are other important communications:

- 1. The Front Desk also advises the Housekeeping Control Desk about group arrivals and crew arrivals. We have already read about the importance of such volume arrivals.
- 2. The Front Desk also relies on the housekeeping for the Housekeeping Room Report on each shift. This confirms the occupancy status of each room so that the Front Desk can cross-tally their room racks with this information.
- 3. The control desk attendant also co-ordinates room transfers upon requests from guests. A guest may ask for room transfer for many reasons, including a better view, noise from lifts, a non-smoking room, and so on. The front desk allots another room and informs the control desk. The desk attendant will inform the concerned floor supervisor who will direct the room attendant to assist the guest in packing and transfer of baggage and personal belongings to the new room. The old room will be treated as a departure room for attention by the room attendant.

## HOUSEKEEPING SUPPLY STORE

The Housekeeping Supply Store is a support to all supervisors. It is under the direct supervision of the Executive Housekeeper whose office is located in the precincts of the Control Desk. It stores expensive power-driven equipment like floor scrubbing machines, carpet shampooing machines, floor polishing machines, vacuum cleaners and their accessories. The room has emergency supplies also such as guest and cleaning supplies in the event of a need before the allotted issue day given by the General Stores. It, therefore, stores one week's supply of cleaning supplies such as soaps, detergents, polishes, etc.; guest supplies and hand cleaning tools such as mops, brooms, brushes, etc. The store is replenished on a weekly basis from the General Stores using the requisition procedure.

## HOUSEKEEPING FURNITURE STORE

Each hotel possesses relatively large quantities of furniture not in immediate use such as banquet tables and chairs, upholstered chairs and sofas, dressers, desks, cribs, etc. Such items are kept with housekeeping for safekeeping. Housekeeping observes a few simple rules with regard to such storage:

- 1. The store should be protected from weather though it should be well ventilated.
- 2. Furniture requiring repair should not be stored here but in the furniture yard.
- 3. Furniture must be thoroughly cleaned before being stored.
- 4. Furniture must be wrapped in cloth before they are stored.
- 5. If space limitations require stacking, this should be done with care and with provision of adequate padding or other surface guards to prevent damage to furniture items.
- 6. Furniture that requires repair or renovation should have a Work Order Slip completed prior to sending it to the furniture yard.
- 7. No furniture should be stored in stairwells or service landings.
- 8. Decisions must be made promptly as to whether damaged furniture is repairable or beyond repair. If obsolete, they should be disposed of as soon as possible for two reasons: (a) they occupy valuable space; and (b) they will further depreciate in storage.

## STORES REQUISITION

Store requisitions are generated in a Stores Requisition Form (Fig. 9.4 in Lesson 9, 'The Floor Pantry'), in triplicate by the following housekeeping personnel:

- The Floor Supervisor to supplement supplies in her floor linen room.
- The Public Area Supervisor for her needs.
- The Desk Control Attendant for the housekeeping store as emergency stocks.

The procedure for store requisition is as follows:

- 1. Each person prepares the requisition in triplicate:
- The original copy is retained in the book for follow-up and record.
- The second copy is sent to the Housekeeper for the storekeeper to keep after issuing the supplies.
- The third copy is also sent to the Housekeeper but returned by the storekeeper in case of any balance due for recovery later.
- 2. The control desk attendant consolidates all requisitions and forwards the requisitions to the Executive Housekeeper for approval.
- 3. The Executive Housekeeper examines the requisitions and approves them or call the concerned supervisor for explanations if she is in doubt. The Housekeeper has to control costs of supplies and keep them within budget.
- 4. Once approved the concerned supervisor is ready to withdraw the supplies from the general store.
- 5. The General Store stocks items of daily consumption for the whole hotel. It is manned by a qualified storekeeper, assisted by a helper to draw items from various shelves. Due to the heavy demand on the store, they allot days to each department for their respective withdrawals. On the allotted day, the housekeeping control desk attendant will inform the concerned supervisor to come personally or send a representative to withdraw their supplies.
- 6. The storekeeper verifies the Executive Housekeeper's approval on each requisition form before issuing the items. He mentions items that are out of stock on the requisition form to claim on the next issue day. The storekeeper retains the second copy of the requisition form after receiving the signature of the person withdrawing items and returns the third copy with his signature to the withdrawer.

## THE LINEN AND THE UNIFORM ROOMS

<!-- image -->

## The Linen and the Uniform Rooms

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To help the reader learn the importance of the Linen and the Uniform

## THE LINEN ROOM

The Linen Room usually serves as the base of all operations for most of the housekeeping departments. It is usually under the control of a Supervisor, who has the responsibilities to issue fresh linen and receive soiled ones. A linen room could also have a dedicated linen store which keeps a stock of new linen to replenish those which are in circulation when they are lost or damaged. The amount of linen maintained is based on the size of the property. For example, linen investment is going to be enormous when one considers the volume of linen to be used in a hotel. The amount of linen is based on the total number of linen required to equip all rooms and restaurants in one time. This is considered as linen in circulation. This par is multiplied keeping in mind the time required to launder the soiled linen. An in-house laundry should take about 24 hours to launder a set of linen while outsourced laundries may take upto 48 hours. Keeping this in mind large hotels will have to

maintain a turnaround par stock of five:

1 round in use (circulation in guest rooms)

1 round in the floor linen room and maid's cart

1 round in the laundry

1 round in the linen room

1 round in the linen store (optional)

It is quite normal for a small hotel to have a round of four. Anything less may pose a challenge for the housekeeper.

Every hotel has its own policy regarding the change of bed linen. Deluxe properties may want to change used bed linen everyday. Economy properties may change linen every alternate day or every

three days. Eco-hotels encourage guests to use linen longer to conserve energy and resources. In any case a room cleared for sale to a new guest will always have fresh linen. The Floor Supervisor will ensure that the hotel policy is carefully implemented.

The typical linen requirement for a twin room would translate as 4 single bed sheets, 2 night spreads, 4 pillow covers, 2 blankets, 2 bed covers, 2 bath towels, 2 face towels, 2 hand towels and 1 bath mat.

The challenge for the linen supervisor increases if the property uses different coloured restaurant linen for each restaurant outlet. Each colour will need its own par stocks. While it is prudent for all hotels to use white linen, interior design concepts may insist on coloured linen, especially in specialty restaurants.

Linen rooms are of two types: (i) centralised ones where all linen is controlled at a central point. Such linen rooms are found at resorts which may have a few rooms only to justify centralisation; (ii) decentralised ones where the main linen room feeds floor pantries which maintain linen par stocks to service a set of rooms. This system is ideal for large buildings, especially high rise ones, which have several floors or such buildings which are too spread out for a centralised linen room e.g. resorts with chalets spread over large acreages that require feeder linen rooms to reach the remote points. These floor pantries are controlled by Floor Supervisors.

Figure 17.1 gives a typical layout of a linen room. It should be observed that the linen room has only one entrance for security reasons and it adjoins the in-house laundry.

## STORAGE CONDITIONS

As the Linen and Uniform Room and Stores carry valuable capital investment of the owner, the Stores must follow strict conditions of storage to prolong the life of these assets. The storage conditions are:

- 1. The floors must be cemented with special grouting along the walls and corners to prevent insects and rodents from creeping in. The walls and ceilings must be easy to keep clean and maintain.
- 2. The room must be well ventilated, cool and dry. Damp conditions cause mildew-a bacterial growth that damages cloth.

- 3. Hot water or steam pipes should not run through the linen and uniform rooms. The rooms should also be protected against dampness, sunlight and chemical fumes.
- 4. Properly designed racks should be used so that rust and white ants do not get to the material. Wood or aluminium racks are sturdy and non-corrosive. The last shelf of the rack should be at least six inches above the floor to prevent dust, water or insects from reaching the material.
- 5. The room must have only one entry or exit point for security reasons. The door must be large enough to permit the hampers and trolleys to and from the laundry.
- 6. The room should be accessible to linen/uniform room personnel only.
- 7. The room should be so located as to be easily accessible to all employees as well as the laundry. The basement or ground floor is preferred to the staff entrance and laundry where heavy noisy equipment is installed.
- 8. The room should have a counter for the exchange of linen/uniforms.
- 9. The room must be subject to periodic schedules of pest control.
- 10. The size of the room is in relation to the size of the property in terms of guest rooms, restaurants and bars. The linen/uniform room must be spacious enough to move around.
- 11. It should be well lit to read sizes of uniforms and record items.

## Storage Tips for Linen

- 1. Restaurant and floor linen should be arranged by size and neatly stacked in shelves.
- 2. Heavier linen must be stacked in lower shelves while lighter ones on higher shelves.
- 3. Cotton items like sheets, pillow cases, table cloths, etc. should not be stored for a long time unless they are washed to remove starch. Starch or finishing chemicals attract insects and make fabric dry and brittle which may result in their getting torn quickly.
- 4. For long-term storage, wrap all linen items in plastic foils or pack in paper-lined cartons after washing. Dark paper is preferred to preserve colour. Wrap loosely to permit air to circulate.

## Storage Tips for Uniforms

- 1. Uniforms of better quality materials should preferably be hung.
- 2. Uniforms made of cheaper materials (used by back house personnel) should be separated size-wise and stacked in racks.
- 3. Small items like gloves, caps, ties, bows, etc. should be kept in closed cupboards.
- 4. Soiled uniforms must be dumped into hampers.
- 5. Coloured or embroidered materials or those with indelible ink should be laundered before storing to prevent discolourisation.
- 6. For long-term storage wrap items in plastic foils or pack them in paper-lined cartons after washing. Dark paper is preferred for preserving colour. Wrap loosely to permit air to circulate.

## EXCHANGE OF LINEN

The exchange process is very critical to the Linen Supervisor as it is here that linen counts can go wrong. Even one piece of linen lost or misplaced a day adds to quite a number in the month. It is for this reason that the Linen Supervisor must maintain a strict exchange process. He coordinates closely with the Laundry Manager or Supervisor. He must keep a track of movement of linen loads from floors and from the linen room. He must follow the exchange norm of one fresh item for the one soiled meticulously.

Given below is the exchange processes followed by the floor supervisor:

## Room Linen

- 1. Send soiled room linen to the laundry either directly from floors by shutes or by the Room boy who trundles a hamper full of soiled linen to the laundry.
- 2. Physically count each soiled item on the floor and enter the figures into the Room Linen Control Sheet (Fig. 17.2) in triplicate and one copy is retained by the floor supervisor.
- 3. Send the second and third copies of the Room Linen Control Sheet with the floor houseman along with the hamper of soiled linen, to the laundry or linen room.

- 4. Alternatively, send the linen through a linen shute which lands at the laundry floor at specific times given by the laundry staff to avoid mix-ups with the linen of other floors. Send the floor houseman to the laundry floor before dispatching the linen from the shute.
- 5. The Laundry or Linen Supervisor, where applicable, recounts the soiled linen in the presence of the houseman, and verifies the quantities in the Room Linen Control Sheet. The concerned supervisor then stamps 'Received' after the tally and returns the second copy while the third copy is retained by him/her. If the laundry supervisor is directly receiving the laundry, s/he sends the second copy to the Linen Supervisor while retaining one copy.
- 6. The Linen Supervisor issues fresh linen on a one-to-one basis. In case the linen room is short of fresh linen at that point of time, then he/she enters the balance due on the Room Linen Control Sheet (Fig. 17.2) and issues the shortfall in the next exchange.

Room Linen Control Sheet

## Restaurant Linen

Each restaurant is given a specific time by the linen room to exchange linen. The Linen Supervisor makes sure that the restaurant representative comes at the stipulated time. The Linen Supervisor observes the following procedure:

- 1. Check the soiled linen received for damages.
- 2. Count every item and tally it with the Food and Beverage Linen Exchange Form (Fig. 17.3) filled by the Restaurant Supervisor.
- 3. Enter the figures into the Linen Exchange Register (Fig. 17.4) especially maintained for food and beverage outlets.

## The Linen and the Uniform Rooms

- 4. Issue the same number of fresh linen on a one-to-one basis and enter the figures in the Linen Exchange Register.
- 5. Forward the soiled linen to laundry for washing after physically counting each item in front of the Laundry Supervisor.
- 6. Tally fresh restaurant linen from the laundry against the Linen Exchange Register.

## LINEN EXCHANGE REGISTER

## DISCARDED LINEN

An important part of linen keeping is the use of discarded linen. Discarded linen are the ones that cannot be used in operations anymore. Discards occur due to irretrievable stains, tears, discolouration, etc.  The Linen Room maintains a discard bin where such items are collected. After the Executive Housekeeper or Deputy Housekeeper ascertains that they are irretrievable, they are to be shown to the inventory ledger accountant who has to declare the item as discards and delete it from his inventory register. The linen keeper also maintains a Discard Register which gives the date, description and numbers of all such discards, which have to be replaced through purchase or from the Housekeeping

Store. All condemned items are stamped as condemned.

The Linen Supervisor has many uses for discards:

- As cleaning cloths for the cleaning crew.
- For covering furniture stored in the furniture yard.
- To wrap carpets kept in storage.
- To cover carpets in rooms when other maintenances are in progress.
- Torn into rags for polishing purposes.
- To wrap long-stored linen and uniforms.

## HIRING OF LINEN

Outsourcing has become a common practice, especially in housekeeping. Most medium to small hotels in Europe and the US outsource the housekeeping function. This means that another agency, specialised in housekeeping services, provides the workforce and expertise to hotels. Hotels then pay a consulting fee and do away with maintaining a Housekeeping Department. The same goes for linen supply. Since linen is expensive, hotels are moving towards hiring of linen from specialised housekeeping companies.  The benefits from such a strategy are:

- 1. The owner does not have to invest in expensive linen.
- 2. The owner can demand good linen quality.
- 3. Laundry services are not required resulting in cost savings.
- 4. It involves lower housekeeping inventory costs.
- 5. Less space is required in linen rooms and stores.
- 6. Cost-effective during off season as linen inventories do not have to be maintained.
- 7. The wear and tear costs of the linen are not the owner's responsibility.

The greatest disadvantage is that the owner and housekeeper do not have total control of linen quality and the supply of fresh linen at the right time.

## THEUNIFORM ROOM

Large properties may have an independent uniform room that is because of the sheer volume of uniforms, rendering this investment in space as unavoidable. Medium to small hotels will combine the Linen and Uniform Room to be space efficient. The conditions for storage of Uniform Rooms are similar to those in Linen Rooms mentioned earlier. Figure 17.5 gives a typical Uniform Room layout.

## The Linen and the Uniform Rooms

We will note that the Uniform Room also has separate exchange counters for employees and the laundry. The Uniform Room must be located where all employees can have access to it. The corridor in front of the room must be wide enough, for several employees who may be able to form a queue during morning rush hours, in order to avoid congestion.

## UNIFORMEXCHANGE PROCEDURE

New employees are issued uniforms authorised by the Personnel Department. Employees are measured for sizes and either given standard uniforms like dungarees, stewarding trousers, etc. or tailor-made for specific styles, e.g. Front Office Receptionists, Lobby Managers, Concierge, etc. Once issued, the employee keeps his/her uniform in locker rooms provided by the hotel separately for men and women, with showers and toilets. Employees of various departments are given specific times to exchange their uniforms. When the employee returns for exchange of a new set, the Uniform

## Room Supervisor will:

- 1. Ensure that the staff has arrived at the stipulated time.
- 2. Check the uniforms for damages.
- 3. Issue fresh uniforms strictly on a one-to-one basis ensuring that the uniform is of correct size. Tailor-made uniforms will have name tags sewn inside the collar or trouser flap in indelible ink. The Supervisor will make sure that the uniform with the correct name is issued to the right person.

Note: If  the  soiled  uniform is damaged and can be mended, the Supervisor will warn the employee. If the uniform cannot be mended, she should report the matter to the Human Resources Department who will deduct the cost from the employee's salary based on the circumstances of damage.

## EXCHANGE PROCEDURE WITH THE LAUNDRY

## Handing Over Procedure for Linen and Uniforms to the Laundry

- 1. Sort uniform/linen as per size, department, quality, and type.
- 2. Count physically the uniforms in the presence of the laundry supervisor before handing them over to him.
- 3. Submit uniforms for dry cleaning along with a Daily Delivery of Uniforms Form (Fig. 17.6).
- 4. Submit room linen against the Room Linen Control Sheet (Fig. 17.2).
- 5. The Restaurant submits linen against the Food and Beverage Exchange Form.
- 6. In all cases, take the Laundry Supervisor's signature in acknowledgement.

## Receiving Fresh Linen and Uniforms

- 1. Receive guest room linen from the laundry against figures shown in the copy of the Room Linen Control Sheet received and stamped by the Laundry Supervisor.
- 2. Receive restaurant linen against figures in the Linen Exchange Register earlier filled in when exchanging linen with the restaurant staff.
- 3. Receive uniforms for dry-cleaning against figures shown in the Daily Delivery of Uniforms Forms filled in earlier when submitting uniforms to the laundry for dry-cleaning.
- 4. Receive linen from the laundry in lots as and when it is ready.

## The Linen and the Uniform Rooms

- 5. Total each type of linen and fill in the Inventory of Room Linen Form.
- 6. Establish the difference in items due from the laundry by comparing the total of the above from the total in the second copy of the Linen Control Sheet (for room linen). These two figures (i.e. Soiled delivered to the laundry and the Fresh received from the laundry) are noted down in a register for every item everyday.
- 7. Calculate the total shortage from the laundry at the end of the month.
- 8. Segregate and storethe linen and uniforms in the respective places.

Fig. 17.6

Daily Delivery of Uniforms Form

Note: The list above is only representative. The list of uniforms is much larger.

## PAR STOCKS

Par stock is the minimum level of supplies required to meet daily demands to ensure smooth operations.

<!-- image -->

## Importance of Par Stocks

- 1. To make correct and efficient investment of capital. The investor does not want to put in extra money than what is necessary for smooth operations.
- 2. To prevent overstocking and thereby avoid chances of spoilage during storage. Oversupply is not only a cost but also idle utilisation leading to deterioration, misuse, theft and loss.
- 3. To make optimum use of space. Excess linen would have to be stored when not in use, thus increasing storage space costs. The owner could gainfully use that space for other activities.
- 4. To ensure proper supply at all times. Rooms can only be ready for sale if there is adequate supply of fresh linen to replace soiled ones. Similarly, employees cannot report on duty if they do not have uniforms.
- 5. To help in effective budgeting. The  Executive  Housekeeper can budget annual capital investments in linen and uniforms, based on par stock standards. He can also calculate par stock deficiencies due to discards.
- 6. To simplify inventory taking. Audits are conducted periodically to safeguard the owner's investment in this capital item. It becomes easy for auditors to tally the par stock because the standards are known.
- 7. To bring about control. Par  stocks  enable  the  linen  keeper  to  maintain  control  on  the numbers needed each day. He can chase the laundry for additional washing cycles in case of deficiencies.

## How to Establish Par Stock

The sections below give a simple way to establish par stock figures.

## Linen

Determine the requirement of each guest room and restaurant per shift. This is established by the linen per bed in a guest room and table in a restaurant. This is multiplied five times as per the following cycle:

One change in circulation

One change in the floor linen rooms

One change in the laundry

One change in the linen room

One change in the housekeeping store (optional)

## Uniforms

The par stock of uniforms is determined on the basis of (a) cloth material, (b) job positions, and (c) the nature of jobs. Four changes are kept for uniforms which are changed daily, such as, waiter coats, utility worker uniforms, etc. The cycle of par stock is as follows:

One change in the laundry

One change in the Uniform room

One change in the housekeeping store

One change in use

More specialised uniforms like ethnic dresses and suits may have a turnover of three times only, in view of cost-in use, in the laundry and store. Items like aprons, dungarees, Chef scarves and caps may have unspecified number to keep the supply constant.

## INVENTORY CONTROL

Since uniforms and linen are heavy investments, it is necessary to keep a close control on this very important asset. Effective control is possible through the following practices:

- (a) Control on misuse, shortages, and mix-ups
- (b) Proper storage
- (c) Regular stock-taking
- (d) Spot checks
- (e) Proper supervision

To prevent damage to linen and uniforms, the following tips need to be kept in mind.

- 1. Check for faulty linen chutes, carts, baskets, washers, etc. which might tear cloth.
- 2. Keep mesh bags at strategic points to prevent loss of small items.
- 3. Inspect employee locker rooms for theft and fine for misuse of linen.
- 4. Laundry should be careful not to put excessive amount of bleach powder. The usual amount is 1% bleach per 100 lbs of linen. Also bleach powder could be damaging at washing temperatures higher than 150° F.
- 5. Linen should be exchanged strictly on a one-to-one basis.
- 6. Damp white linen or uniforms should not lie on concrete or iron. Concrete stains are almost impossible to remove while iron rust causes holes after washing.
- 7. Employees must not wipe spilt food, medicines or chemicals with linen but use dusters instead.
- 8. Laundry should load washing machines properly. Under loading could 'beat up' the linen.
- 9. Hydro-extractors on high speed operations could tear fabrics; their speed should hence be monitored.
- 10. Laundry tumblers should be checked regularly for pins, paper clips, etc. that could prick holes into the fabric.
- 11. Put proper pressure and heat on all irons to prevent burn stains.

## STOCK-TAKING

Stock-taking is the physical verification of all linen and uniforms in the cycle at periodic intervals or when accounting books are closed at the end of the year. Overages or shortages can be determined by variances in physical counts and the balances in the inventory ledger.

## Principles of Stock-taking

- 1. Segregate and group all items (including discards).
- 2. Count items physically every three months known as quarterly inventory.
- 3. Count items in circulation and in store separately and total.

- 4. Stamp discards 'Condemned' and keep aside.
- 5. Tally totals counted with the last inventory figures plus new issues.
- 6. Be present when the inventory clerk and auditor are counting.
- 7. Conduct stock-taking on three separate days, each for
- (a) Uniforms
- (b) Room linen
- (c) Restaurant linen

Room Linen Inventory Form

## Procedure of Stock-taking

- 1. Identify all locations of linen. These locations will be:
- Beds in the guest rooms
- Floor linen pantries
- End of chutes receiving soiled linen from floors at the laundry stop
- Linen in the laundry-in wash, in hampers, at the presses, in storage shelves and in trolleys laden with laundered linen ready for delivery to the linen room
- Linen room
- Linen stores
- 2. Conduce linen stock-taking at the end of the morning shift when guest rooms have been made for the day.
- 3. Seal all floor linen rooms and shutes.
- 4. Freeze laundry delivery carts for dispatch.
- 5. Seal the linen room.

## PUBLIC AREA CLEANING

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Introduction to Public Areas

<!-- image -->

To help the readers understand the meaning of Public Areas in hotel terms and the cleaning and maintenance challenge it poses to housekeeping.

## WHAT IS A PUBLIC AREA?

A public area, in hotel parlance, is a common space and facility accessible to resident guests and the local populace to meet, transact business and socialise. Broadly speaking, the public areas would include (a) ' front of the house ' areas such as porches, lobbies, front offices, management offices, and public washrooms; (b) ' revenue areas ' such as restaurants, health club, banquets, beauty salon, shopping arcade, business centre, cyber café, bars, lounges, gymnasium and guest rooms; (c) ' recreation areas ' such as swimming pools, sports courts, beaches, landscaped gardens, etc.; and (d) ' convenience areas ' such as bank, post office, convenience store, travel desk, guest relations,

foyers,  elevators,  corridors,  car  parks  (open air  and  basements),  fire-escapes,  public  stair wells. All these areas must be well maintained, cleaned and kept in order at all times as they are open to guest view. Such activity has to be done discretely and safely with minimum disturbance and exposure to guests. It is for this reason that most public area cleaning is done at night when there is least public traffic in the hotel.

There are certain considerations, at the outset, by the investor when creating public areas:

- 1. The financial outlay available.
- 2. The investor's  vision  of  the  number  of facilities s/he wishes to provide.

<!-- image -->

- 3. The stature of the property in terms of its quality, the market positioning of the product and service (whether budget, mid-priced, luxury or super luxury).
- 4. Best utilisation of space for revenue.
- 5. The number of rooms and the proportion of guest traffic expected.
- 6. The public areas offered by the competition.
- 7. The volume of arrivals and departures each day.
- 8. Type and expanse of external  areas, e.g.  beaches,  landscapes,  car  parks, driveways, porches, etc.
- 9. Basement areas
- 10. Utility areas required for airconditioning plants, electrical switchboards, boilers, firefighting plants, etc.

<!-- image -->

- 11. Staff facilities, e.g. employee staff quarters, canteens, sports areas, etc.

The local building authorities also insist on a minimum ratio of empty space outside in relation to building space.

The complexity of hotel public areas increases if the hotel has its own private beach or independent chalets spread over large acreages. All surfaces have their own unique properties that need technical understanding to maintain. For example, driveways and car parks are made of tar; beaches of sand; pathways of stones; landscapes with gardens, golf courses and tennis courts with lawn; swimming pools, waterfalls, rockeries and fountains that have their own cleaning challenges with water; and hotel facades that get more difficult as the architecture is complex.

## SCOPE OF ACTIVITY

The diagram below gives the scope of activity involved for the public area crew in a typical large downtown hotel.

<!-- image -->

Basement: The basement consists of the following:

- car parks,
- support offices as human resources, housekeeping, purchasing and training rooms
- staff cafeteria,
- linen and uniform rooms,
- stores
- laundry
- engineering plants (engineering and heating, firefighting, generators, etc).

Ground level: The ground level provides easy access to the public and therefore ideal for certain revenue areas. The hotel could have a lower lobby that accesses the revenues areas. Typical facilities at the ground level include:

- health club or spa
- discotheque or night club
- speciality restaurants.
- indoor recreation like squash courts, gymnasiums and swimming pools.
- lower level shopping arcade

Externally, the hotel would have the main landscapes with walkways leading to beaches and water sports.

Lobby Level: The entrance to the hotel is a floor up. Typical facilities at this

level are:

- Main reception and lobby
- Lobby lounge
- Main restaurants (especially the coffee shop and bar)
- The back office of the front office
- Left luggage room

<!-- image -->

- Telecommunications
- The shopping arcade including the travel agency; beauty salons; barber shops; money exchange; bank; post office; drug store; emporiums and shops, etc
- Function rooms and meeting rooms with foyers, independent driveways and car parks, independent entrances and exits for the large volume of guests that attend banquets

## Mezzanine Floor: This has the following facilities:

- Executive offices of the general manager, sales and marketing, accounts, food and beverage manager, etc.

<!-- image -->

- Business centre.

Guest  Floors: The  guest  floors  rise  above  the mezzanine floor and relates to the number of rooms

<!-- image -->

the  hotel  has.  Public  areas  are  not  found  on  floors  except  perhaps  for  the business lounge which is exclusively for the resident guests who stay on the executive floors.

<!-- image -->

Rooftop: This obviously offers a panoramic view. The investor would like to have the exclusive night club and cocktail lounge located here. Hotels with limited external space may locate the swimming pool on the rooftop.

The public areas of small hotels like resorts, motels and hostels may be limited to an all-purpose dining room and at the most a bar. These properties may however have large external areas.

By now the reader will realise the enormity of the public area responsibility. The public area will naturally require considerable technical expertise in cleaning and man management to complete the challenges ahead of them.

Cleaning schedules-Each shift, Daily, Weekly and Monthly

## TYPES OF SOILAGE

The public area crew will encounter several challenges in cleaning. The types of soil vary as follows:

Dust refers to general particles of loose sand which float in the air and at many times not visible. It is easily cleaned by dusting with dry cloth, feather duster or brush and dust pan.

Dirt refers to clumps of dust caused by moisture, grease or tar. Dirt also includes organic substances like dead foliage, excreta, etc. The feature of dirt is that it sticks to the surface and therefore requires an abrasive movement to dislodge it along with a cleaning agent.

Litter refers to loose rubbish things found in areas where there is human activity, e.g. waste paper in  offices,  discarded  vegetable  and  meat  trimmings  in  kitchens,  empty  bottles  and  cellophane packets in public areas, etc.

Stains on a surface are caused by an external element such as acids, dyes, paints, chemicals, alkali, etc. Fresh stains can be absorbed with powder, or dissolved by the use of apt chemicals such as alkaline cleaners to neutralise stains caused by acids.

Discolouration is caused by exposure to moist air. Metals are prone to this phenomenon, e.g. iron gets rusted, silver and brass darkens and copper gets green. All metals have their respective polishes to bring them to their original sheen.

## CLEANING METHODS

## Choice of Cleaning Methods

The choice of cleaning method depends on various factors as listed below:

- 1. The nature of soil
- 2. The nature of the surface that is soiled
- 3. The properties of cleaning agents suitable for the surface
- 4. The best way to clean without dispersing dust to other areas
- 5. Cost effectiveness in terms of materials and labour time

The method should restore the surface to its original sheen and colour. While the methods used have to be viewed individually, depending upon the surface, there are some general principles that can be applied to all cleaning:

- 1. Remove loose dust and litter before starting cleaning procedures, especially for stubborn stains and grime.
- 2. Use lighter cleaning methods first before attempting stronger methods.
- 3. Use clean and dry duster cloths and linen.
- 4. Choose the simplest methods when in doubt.
- 5. Use abrasives as a last resort as they can damage the surface.
- 6. Use an agent that is the least offensive in smell, if alternatives are available.
- 7. Be cautious of spoiling the surrounding areas while cleaning a surface, e.g. fingerprints on walls, grazing other articles.
- 8. Use methods that pose least inconvenience to guests. Guests can be disturbed by noise, smell or cleaning materials lying loosely in public areas.
- 9. Be sure that during the process of cleaning, areas do not become accident prone, e.g. wet floors, greasy surfaces, obstacles in the way, etc.
- 10. Plan cleaning schedules carefully to ensure the least time.
- 11. Clean regularly to ensure a sparkling house.
- 12. Train staff to take safety precautions in cleaning methods and the use of cleaning agents, e.g. using of gloves, masks, etc.

One of the crucial items in any cleaning is water. The role of water is:

- 1. To hold the dirt and remove it away as in rinsing.
- 2. To react with the dirt and grease, break it down and hold it in suspension. This is done with the aid of detergents.

- 3. Two emulsify and hold grease in suspension together with the dirt so that it can be removed. The use of alkalis helps in the process.

With these principles in mind, a public area cleaner is ready to tackle the cleaning of various surfaces.

## Methods of Cleaning

There are several methods employed by the public area crew to clean various surfaces, e.g. tar, cement, ceramic tiles, granite, marble, terrazzo, stone, wood, carpet, vinyl, asphalt, rubber and linoleum. This is in addition to furniture, artefacts, landscapes, etc. that they have to clean and maintain.

Dusting: A basic dry method, manually using a feather duster or soft lint cloth. A variant is dustmopping, using a dry mop.

Damp-dusting: A wet method, manually using a cloth and neutral solution for dirt.

Sweeping: A dry method for removing dust from floors with brooms. Carpeted areas requiring spot cleaning will need a brush and dust pan.

Spot mopping: It is to remove wet spills of liquid of any type at a local spot as well as to avoid stains developing on the floor surface. A variant is spot cleaning which is a manual method to remove isolated stains with an appropriate stain-removal agent. This is used especially removing stains on upholstery, drapery, carpets and other flooring.

Wet mopping: A wet method, using a damp mop on a floor surface done only after the surface has been dry dusted.

Vacuum cleaning: A dry method, especially on carpeted surfaces, using a vacuum cleaner that employs an electro-mechanical suction to remove dust.

Wet vacuum cleaning: A wet method of cleaning large wet surfaces, using the same electromechanical suction processes.

Buffing: It  is  a  wet  electro-mechanical  method  where  a  buffer  machine  with  pads  or  brushes restores dull floors like granite or marble to its original sheen with friction facilitated by a spray of an appropriate detergent.

Floor polishing: It is a dry electro-mechanical method, using a floor machine with a speed of 175-1500 rpm to floors which are first dusted and applied with the appropriate polish to restore the floor to its original sheen.

Scrubbing: It is a wet method using light or heavy scrubbing machine (based on the floor soilage) that uses pads or brushes to scuff deeply embedded dirt in floors. The machine sprays detergent according to pH potency required to make the process of scrubbing efficient. A variant is manual scrubbing for smaller surface areas like mirrors or glass using a detergent spray and a cloth. The surface is dried with a squeegee.

Burnishing: A dry mechanical method, using a high speed burnishing floor machine which uses friction and heat to restore gloss to surfaces like marble, granite and slate.

<!-- image -->

Stripping: A method of removing old floor finishes like tiles or wood and the seal that binds it to the floor, to reveal the raw floor for refinishing.

## Cleaning Supplies

A typical housekeeping department will maintain an inventory of the following cleaning supplies which are consumable and need replenishing. These are:

All-purpose cleaners, disinfectants, germicides, toilet bowl cleaners, window glass cleaners, metal polishes, furniture polishes, and stain removers.

## Cleaning Equipment

Public area crew will require small equipment for daily cleaning chores. These are:

- Brooms
- Brushes-hard, soft, scrubbing, upholstery, cobwebs, toothbrush, drain brush, carpet brush, leather brush, fabric brush, bottle brush, toilet bowl brush
- Mops-dry and wet
- Mop wringer buckets
- Buckets
- Feather dusters
- Squeegees
- Spray bottles
- Rubber gloves
- Protective eye goggles
- Cloth-cleaning dusters, swabs, chamois leather, lint cloth

Some examples of such equipment are given below.

Flex Neck Broom Yard Brooms are used for sweeping external surfaces like the driveways, walkways, porch, car parks, employee' entrance, receiving apron, rooftops and all other tarred and cemented floor areas. Public area cleaners use these brooms for removing dead foliage, mud and cigarette butts from these areas.

Sweeping Brooms are  used  for  cleaning  internal  floors  prior  to subjecting them to water cleaning. The typical surfaces would be found in uncarpeted corridors like in the basements or public corridors found in shopping arcades and lobbies. The brooms remove the grime and mud from the surfaces that are swept into dustpans and deposited to common garbage areas.

<!-- image -->

Mops are  meant to be moistened in pails of water before being applied on the floors. Public floors with tiles, marble, granite, terrazzo and linoleum are best cleaned with this method.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Floor Dusters are used to wipe out dust only. It may not remove difficult stains and spots.

Magnet Mop

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Squeegees are  used  when  floors  are  washed down with water and not mopped. Public cloak rooms, service landings and stairwells are subject to this treatment. Squeegees have rubber endings that collect water with the sweep and diverted to drains.

Cotton Mops are used when adequate drainage is not provided. These mops absorb the water and are then squeezed out into pails.

Floor Scrubbers are used for wiping difficult stains and spots on floors.

Feather Dusters are  useful  tools  for  cleaning public area tables, lamp shades, sofas and artefacts that are at floor level or on walls. Feather dusters are light and do not scratch surfaces of delicate materials.

<!-- image -->

Hand Brush and Dustpan is the common tool that all public cleaners will like to have to remove dirt from table tops, carpets or hard floors.

<!-- image -->

Buckets or pails are essential to any wet cleaning of surfaces.

Sponges are handy for all surfaces to clean and scrub difficult stains and spots. They work well with special detergent spray bottles.

Floor Polishers are expensive equipment used to polish floors especially those with stone finishes (granite, marble, terrazzo, etc.). Polishing is done on a weekly basis and sometimes on monthly basis, depending upon the floors and frequency of use.

Heavy Duty Vacuum Cleaners are used for extensive carpet areas as those found in banquet halls, carpeted corridors, lobbies, executive offices, etc.

Carpet Shampoo Machines are  used  to  shampoo  carpets  on  a weekly or monthly basis depending on use. The machine has a simultaneous process to feed and suck water on the carpet surface. The supervisor has a special schedule for carpet shampooing to maintain them in pristine condition.

Drapery Cleaners are  automated  to  clean extensive upholstery and curtains found in banquets, lobbies and restaurants.

Portable Steamers are used to wrinkle out draperies and upholstery found in public areas.

Trash cans are  essential  to  public  area  cleaning  because  it  is  here  that  all garbage is deposited to be later emptied into large garbage dumps cleared by the municipality garbage removal crews. Trash cans are kept at strategic points in exteriors to serve given areas.

Litter Bins of chrome are placed at all internal places in the hotel, especially outside elevators for guests to stub there  cigarettes;  lobbies  and  foyers;  shopping  arcade corridors; public bathrooms; and any other place where people are likely to congregate. They come in all shapes and sizes and can be used based on the density of traffic and purpose of use. Many have cigarette disposal facility.

Bulb extractors are handy tools to remove and replace fused bulbs. Though this may be strictly a function of the maintenance department, it has been handed over to the public area cleaners and room attendants because it is a  simple  task  that  saves  the  time  of  long  procedures  if  the  maintenance department were involved.

Though the chart above may appear simple, the numbers involved are quite large. Each public area cleaner would have the responsibility of 2500 sq. ft. at a minimum. If the hotel has large spaces or public traffic increases, the count increases with each 2500 sq. ft. The public area supervisor and cleaners challenge is to execute cleaning schedules with least disturbance to guests and employees. This means that most internal cleaning is at night when most services shut down. Let us see the areas that come in the night cleaning schedule:

## NIGHT CLEANING SCHEDULE

Restaurants and Bars - While most shut by 12 midnight, night clubs and discotheques can stay open till 3.00 am. The coffee shop, though open at night, is less occupied after the dinner service which completes at 12 midnight.

Executive Offices - They close after 6.00 pm. However few like the General Manager's office, reception back-office, accounts, etc. may stay open till late at night for work exigencies.

Business Centre - It is open for 24 hours.

<!-- image -->

Shopping Arcade - May stay open till eight at night. Some states keep their shopping facilities open till 11.00 pm.

Meeting Rooms - Meetings normally observe business hours and usually close at 6.00 pm.

Banquet Halls - They can keep open till late hours. Award nights may extend till 12 midnight while wedding receptions till past midnight. The banquet halls are left in a mess with such a large traffic of people. If the hall/s is required the next morning, the night crew has a challenge.

Lobbies - All lobbies have to be cleaned at night after 12 midnight. Though there may be a few guests, cleaning has to proceed to be ready for early morning peak traffic.

Elevators/Escalators - These can be shut down one by one for cleaning at night, as guest traffic is less.

Basements - These include car parks, corridors, training rooms, staff locker rooms and support offices like purchasing, housekeeping, laundry, time-office and human resources. The linen/uniform rooms and stores are not accessible to the public area staff at night for security reasons.

Public Cloak rooms - They are relatively free after the restaurants close.

## DAY CLEANING SCHEDULE

Day cleaning schedules include driveways, walkways, porch, external car parks, swimming pool areas, beach fronts, gardens (though the gardeners take that responsibility also) patios and terraces, rooftop areas, night club, discotheque and cocktail lounges (because they open at night only), banquet halls, linen rooms and stores when they are under the supervision of the respective keepers.

## SUPERVISORY TASKS

The Public Area Supervisor reports to the Assistant Housekeeper/Executive Housekeeper. She has to carry out the objectives set by them in her area of activity. She has to protect the company's valuable assets; she must motivate her crew to give a good guest experience; she must ensure that the equipment are properly handled and preventive maintenance schedules are arranged on time to give a long life to valuable equipment assets; she must control expenses of consumables by ensuring adoption of correct cleaning procedures; she must ensure that key revenue areas are clean and ready to receive guests at their respective allotted time; she must train her staff to high productivity, safety and quality standards; she must monitor the lost and found procedures; and above all she should take efforts to bring pride to the establishment.

The public area supervisor attends the departmental briefing by the executive housekeeper at the start of the day. She is particularly interested to know the special events in the hotel which will need attention. These events can include corporate training programmes, board meetings, food festivals, outdoor galas, weddings, concerts and recitals, supper theatre, fashion shows, corporate promotions, frat parties, etc. These events will indicate her the expected work load in banquet halls, gardens, lobbies, restaurants, etc. She then proceeds to check the log book for any special messages left by the night supervisor before she proceeds to brief her staff.

While the principles of briefing as discussed earlier remain the same, she will particularly do the following:

- Take the attendance of her crew and ascertain the resources available to her. 1.
- She will check their turnout and confirm that they are to the standards of the hotel. 2.
- Allot cleaning areas and what has to be accomplished in each. 3.
- Inform the crew about special events in the hotel that will need additional attention. 4.

The public area supervisor will equip the crew with the tools required to do their tasks. She opens the housekeeping equipment store to distribute the tools. The equipment (please also see Part 8 Lesson 18 and Part 9 Lesson 22 'Cleaning Equipment' for details).

The prime responsibilities of a Public Area Supervisor are to:

- Take rounds of the entire hotel to ensure that the standards of cleanliness. 1.
- Ensure that cleaning methods used are the right ones. 2.
- Note all maintenance requirements which she will report to the control desk attendant to raise 3. maintenance orders.
- Follow-up on maintenance requests till they are complete. 4.
- Coordinate with the horticulturist and the florist for flower arrangements, internal gardens and 5. potted plants.
- Clean function rooms for the next event. Often banquet halls need cleaning during an event. 6. She will ensure that this is done as discretely as possible.
- Meet with her team members individually to resolve their grievances, if any. 7.
- Provide encouragement and motivation to give their best productivity. 8.
- Coach team members who require special training. 9.

One of the duties of the public area supervisor is to appraise her team members. She will set productivity standards and objectives against which she will evaluate them. She will give her recommendations to the executive housekeeper for recognition and rewards for good performers. Alongside the appraisals she will identify training needs. She will decide if those needs are fulfilled by coaching by her or will need the training department involved. Some of the training inputs she will seek from external sources are:

- Use of firefighting equipment by the local fire brigade 1.
- Use of cleaning equipment by suppliers 2.
- First-aid and CPR by St John's Ambulance or similar experts 3.
- Team-building by the training department 4.
- Customer service skills by the training department 5.

## PUBLIC AREAS

There are certain set procedures of cleaning different components of a hotel public area. In this chapter, we shall discuss these procedures for specific areas one by one.

In hotels which do not have filtration and water treatment equipment, pools are emptied once a week. Pool cleaning includes:

- Scrubbing of pool walls and floors using wire brushes.
- Hand-scrubbing tiles and overflow gutters at the edges of the pool every four days.
- Sweep and wet mop daily the outside terraces including those surrounding swimming pools.
- Scrub serrated tiles which have a tendency to accumulate oily films from bathers' feet using strong detergent periodically to retain the original tile colours.
- Apply rock salt periodically in terrace areas to prevent fungus growth between tiles.
- Inspect diving boards, diving platforms and pool stairs daily to ensure that they are clean and safe.
- Dust pool side furniture including chairs, lounge tables, sun mats and garden umbrellas.

## Basements

Basements are broomed daily and periodically washed clean. Engineering staff may prefer to keep their areas clean and will know how to deal with oil spills, tar stains, etc. If not, then such care has to be provided by housekeeping cleaners.

## External Areas

External areas start from the gate apron; driveways to the porch; the porch itself; car-parks; gardens; walkways; fountains; beaches; etc. Yard brooms are handy equipment for cleaning of these areas. The dirt and dust accumulated is gathered in mobile trash cans and deposited at the municipal dump located in the precincts. Beaches are kept clean with sand rakes. Gardens are normally maintained by the gardeners themselves but take help of housekeeping at times.

To familiarise the reader with the range of cleaning equipment used by housekeeping

## EQUIPMENT SELECTION

Cleaning tools are essential for housekeeping professionals. They help improve productivity and efficiency. As equipment is expensive, their selection is of utmost importance. The correct choice and quality of equipment could save the costs of breakdowns, labour and time. During the purchase of equipment, the following need to be kept in mind:

- Quality-based on the usage history in other organisations. 1.
- Performance-it should be tried and tested. 2.
- Reliability-of the supplier to meet time supply deadlines. 3.
- Transportation time-to replenish stocks. 4.
- User friendly-equipment should be light, well balanced and easy to manipulate. 5.
- Availability-of parts and accessories. 6.
- Sturdiness-in terms of usage and durability. 7.
- Inexpensive-cost-effectiveness compared to other alternatives. 8.
- Easy maintenance-spare parts must be easily available and inexpensive. 9.
- Warranties-to cover faulty performance during a certain period after purchase. 10.
- Productivity-in terms of square feet it cleans in one hour. 11.
- Washing efficiency-of extractors and wet vacuum cleaners in terms of the pressure when 12. injecting fluid. They come with pressures from 11 to 1000 PSI. Similarly, the solution recovery is equally important in terms of time taken to lift solution.
- Appearance-as the equipment will be in guest view. 13.
- Ease of handling-it should not physically overload the operators. 14.

## STORAGE OF EQUIPMENT

To give equipment a longer life, they have to be stored properly after each use. Given below are some storage tips:

- 1. Dry and ventilate store- as dampness causes rust and mildew that degenerates equipment.
- 2. Provide space-to access shelves and to facilitate cleaning.
- 3. Secure locking-to prevent pilferage.
- 4. Keep stores accessible-to all cleaning personnel during operations to avoid any hold-up in cleaning schedules.
- 5. Clean and dry wringer trolleys-before storing them.
- 6. Overturn brushes-do not rest on their bristles.
- 7. Seal all detergents and polishes-to prevent evaporation and drying.
- 8. Wring mops and dry them before storage.
- 9. Label racks and cupboards for easy identification.
- 10. Clean equipment thoroughly prior to storing them.
- 11. Label equipment accessories and keep preferably in locked cupboards.
- 12. Maintain stock records showing the following:
- (a) Date of purchase
- (b) Kind of stock and quality
- (c) Name of supplier
- (d) Cost per unit
- (e) Date of issue into service
- (f) Remarks on suitability and durability.
- 13. Follow correct rules before issuing equipment as follows:
- (a) Issue equipment at definite times.
- (b) Issue new equipment strictly against worn-out equipment.
- (c) Label or code equipment to identify from where it has been issued, e.g. floor, public area, etc.
- 14. Subject the store to regular inspections and audit.
- 15. Wrap expensive equipment in polythene to protect them from dust during storage.

## TYPES OF CLEANING EQUIPMENT

Cleaning equipment can be put into six broad categories:

## Electro-Mechanical Equipment

## Vacuum cleaners

Vacuum cleaners are the greatest friends of housekeeping cleaning staff.  They  come  with  nozzles  and  attachments  for  all  types  of surfaces. They are used for large carpeted areas. They are quick, less laborious and prevent dust from spreading elsewhere in the room. There are many types of vacuum cleaners:

- (a) Upright models work on a combined suction and beating process. There are many kinds of upright vacuum cleaners:

<!-- image -->

- Beater-bar vacuum cleaners agitate carpet piles and loosen dirt;
- Brush vacuums agitate carpets glued to the floor;
- Pile lifter vacuums have strong suction capacity and a separate brush motor that restores crushed carpet piles. There are canister models with tanks that are mounted on castors and some that are held on the operator's back to reach difficult corners and edges.
- (b) Floor models - Cylindrical or spherical vacuum cleaners that operate solely on suction.

A vacuum cleaner must be checked that it is functioning, before use. Here are some tips in the use of vacuum cleaners.

- 1. It  should move crossways over carpets to ensure that suction draws out the dust. A good suction can be judged by the pull against the carpet.
- 2. Straighten the wire connecting to the power socket as coiled wire leads to unmanageable knots that trip the vacuum cleaner or operator.
- 3. Pick small sharp objects like pins and needles by hand to prevent damage to the nozzle or suction tube resulting in ineffective suction.
- 4. Clean the dust bags of the vacuum cleaner frequently as an empty bag provides greater suction. The bag may be emptied into a newspaper or paper sack and disposed with the rubbish.
- 5. Keep all brush attachments free from dust, bits of cotton and hair, picked up in the course of cleaning.
- 6. Never use conventional vacuum cleaners to clean wet floors.

A dustette is a small, light vacuum cleaner used for cleaning curtains, upholstery and mattresses. It cleans by brush and suction and is very easy to handle.

Wet Vacuums: This vacuum sucks water from floors or can both suck and spray water to rinse the soiled area. Squeegee attachments on wet vacuums can make floor clean-up, stripping and scrubbing more efficient. Wet vacuums come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some canister models can be dragged on castors while others can be strapped on the back of the cleaner. These vacuums have collection tanks that store the water that has been sucked up from the floors. This equipment can be used on wet carpets as well. Some wet vacuums

<!-- image -->

may be pushed like a cart and are heavier for large water suction needs off floors.

Wet Extractors: While wet vacuum cleaners have a suction feature, wet extractors have suction and water injection features. With this, they simultaneously rinse and suck water from the surface.

They are best for both carpets and floors. The basic principle of operation is that the extractor sprays water and detergent onto the surface and then uses suction to extract the water into tanks built into the wet extractor. Some machines have agitators before spraying to loosen the dirt from the carpet. They have other attachments for draperies and upholstery as well. Wet extractors come in various shapes and sizes. They come in lighter portable tank versions, as well as the heavy duty push-cart variety. They can be used for both floors and carpets. Some extractors can also have a feature for dry pick-up like normal vacuum cleaners.

## Rotary Floor Machines

Rotary machines have several applications: shampoo, polish and scrub. They are versatile for both carpets and floors just by the change of an attachment e.g. the bonnet (cover) block can be changed to brush carpets; pads for spin pad cleaning, mist pad cleaning, bonnet pad shampoos, buffing, burnishing, scrubbing, stripping and refinishing floors (see lesson 22); or brushes to perform dry foam cleaning, or brush shampoos. Manufacturers provide a variety of accessories for specific purposes:

- Pads for stripping, scrubbing, polishing, burnishing and spray cleaning.
- Mechanical scrubbers for large uncarpeted floors after they are washed with water and detergent.
- Scrubbers to clean any sticky grit on floors.
- Mechanical polishers for large polished wood or vinyl floors. The floor must be swept clear of dust and mud marks. Polish is lightly rubbed into the floor surface for the best results.

The machine has a feed-in tray for detergent solutions and tanks for water supply and water extraction. Rotary machines come at different speeds ranging from less than 175 rpm for carpets to 1500 rpm for burnishing and buffing of other surfaces.

## Use and maintenance

All machines especially rotary machines must be handled by trained and experienced people only. Improper use of the machines can damage carpets such as seam separation, de-lamination of backing material, buckling, shrinking, premature face fibre wear. Such equipment comes with accessories and attachments like hoses and electrical cords. Here are some tips for their care:

- Check hoses for perforation and leaks. They must be rinsed properly after use.
- Check electrical cords for frayed insulation and naked wire.
- Plugs must fit the sockets well.
- Never insert bare wire into sockets as they pose hazards of electrocution and short circuits.
- Remove small objects like pins and needles with a brush and dustpan first, before vacuum cleaning the carpet, as these items tend to puncture the dust bag of the vacuum cleaner.
- Remove large objects from the floor as they could damage the suction process.
- Suction nozzles should face downwards along the face of the carpet when vacuuming as other articles like jewellery, fine garments can be sucked in.

## Containers

Containers are required in cleaning operations to carry liquid or dust, to mix detergents and to carry cleaning items. The types of containers include:

- a. Buckets or pails for carrying water primarily. They come in plastic or galvanized metal.
- b. Basins and bowls that are used for removing spots and stains. They usually come in plastic.
- c. Dust pans used for collecting dust by hand brushes. They come in plastic or galvanized metals.
- d. 'Housemaid box' or 'hand caddy' is a plastic deep carry tray with a handle for various cleaning solutions, brushes and dusters.
- e. Public refuse bins that come in chrome for internal use and galvanized metal for external use. Smaller sani-bins with lids operated with foot pedals are available for toilets.

- f. Waste bins are used in guest rooms and bathrooms, offices and restaurants. They come in plastic. They must be lined with garbage bags to size to easily dispose trash.
- g. Spray bottles with fine nozzles to spray mist on surfaces like mirrors and glass.
- h. Polish applicator trays for mixing floor polishes. They come with an applicator mop.
- i. Mixing buckets for carrying detergent solutions.
- j. Tanks for wet extractors and wet vacuum cleaners that collect water sucked up from floors by the machines.
- k. Vacuum cleaner bags that collect the dust from floors and carpets.

## Use and Maintenance

Most containers  are  made  of  plastic  these  days  for  aesthetic  appeal,  lightness  and  easy maintenance.

- Containers must be cleaned everyday by gently rinsing them inside out. They must be dried before stacking.
- Buckets may be piled upside down.
- Tanks of galvanized metal must be cleaned thoroughly before and after use.
- Vacuum cleaner bags must be allowed to fill to 2/3 rd capacity. They should be cleaned out at this point. Vacuum bags must be empty before storage.
- Wheels (or casters) must be well oiled for easy carriage and free of dust, tangled strings and hair, etc. Broken wheels must be replaced immediately to give the equipment manoeuvrability.

## Brushes

Brushes are manufactured to fulfil a number of objectives.

- 1. Brushes with soft fibre or nylon bristles that are designed to brush carpets, cane, etc. without damaging the surfaces.
- 2. Scrub brushes that have short coarse bristles designed for use on surfaces ingrained with dirt and stains.
- 3. Toilet brush for cleaning WC and bidet bowls.
- 4. Sink brush that comes in wire for unclogging sink outlets.
- 5. Bottle brushes with short coarse bristles to reach difficult nooks like overflow channels of sinks and tubs.
- 6. Scrub brush for cleaning hard grime from floors.
- 7. Carpet hand brush for cleaning carpets as an alternative to vacuum cleaners.
- 8. Tapestry brush for cleaning delicate draperies.
- 9. Cane chair brush which is a soft nylon brush that prevents damage to cane surfaces.
- 10. Soft hand brush for gathering dust from various surfaces. It goes with a dustpan.
- 11. Wall brush has long handles to reach the upper reaches of walls. They are soft so as to not damage wall finishes.
- 12. Feather duster that is soft as a feather to clean delicate surfaces like lampshades, televisions, etc.
- 13. Nylon nap brush used to restore carpet pile after cleaning.
- 14. Hand shampoo brush used on stairs and edges.
- 15. Hearth brush for removing ash from fireplaces. Hearths are found in old palace hotels or colonial style structures.

## Use and Maintenance

Brushes must be free of fluff, hair and dust each day. Periodic washing is also recommended. Natural bristles tend to lose some of their stiffness if washed frequently but by giving the brushes a final

rinse in salted cold water, the bristles regain their natural stiffness. Nylon brushes wash more easily and dry quickly. In general, brushes must be washed by working the bristles up and down in warm water and soap lather and rinsed clean with cold water and sunned. Brushes must be replaced that are worn less than 1/8th of an inch. They must be dry when stored and not placed on their bristles.

## Mops and Brooms

Mops and brooms are basic tools for cleaning floors. The types are:

- a. Yard brooms with coarse bristles to clean rough floors and garden areas. They come with long handles to reduce fatigue over large areas and hand held shorter ones for small areas.
- b. Wall brooms have long cane handles with soft bristles to clean tall ceilings, ledges and cornices and to remove cobwebs in corners.
- c. Mops are used for dusting floors as well as cleaning the floors with water. They come in various sizes for different purposes.
- d. Soft sweeping broom for internal areas to remove dust from floors and carpets.
- e. Squeegee a tool with a rubber blade, like a windshield wiper used for gathering and channelizing water. There are small hand held ones for window glazes and large ones for floors.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Use and maintenance

In principle, soft bristled brooms are used on smooth floors while coarse-bristled ones are used on coarse surfaces especially outside. Brooms are maintained in the same manner as brushes. Mops must be washed in hot soapy water or detergent (never both together). The use of soapless detergent will prevent the formation of scum. The mop should be tightly squeezed out by hand, shaken well in the open air and left to dry. Coarse cotton mops are used for large stone or cement floors. It takes less time to clean than hand washing bit cannot ensure a good standard of cleanliness. New mops must be soaked in clean water for 30 minutes to allow for shrinkage.

## Cleaning Cloths and Sponges

Cleaning cloths are also very basic to any cleaning activity. The types of cleaning cloths used are:

- f. Cloth dusters
- g. Rags for applying polish
- h. Flannelette cloth for polishing
- i. Chamois leather
- j. Glass cloth
- k. Floor dusters
- l. Faucet duster
- m. Sponges

## Trolleys

The housekeeping department has at its use several types of trolleys to transport large quantities of material that cannot be easily carried by hand. Some examples of these trolleys are:

- a. The maid's cart, which has been discussed in detail earlier in Part V Lesson 14.
- b. Janitor's trolley is a mobile work station for the public area cleaners to carry different mops, brooms and detergents to tackle various surfaces and cleaning changes.
- c. Mop wringer trolley on casters with one or two buckets with a wringer attached. It can have a deep shelf for detergents and a trash bag.
- d. Linen trolleys for the transfer of fresh linen from the laundry to the linen room and floor pantries.

## Sundry Equipment and Protective Cloth

Cleaning schedules also use other  tools  and  accessories  for efficient work, such as:

- a. Step ladders or stool steps.
- b. Cleaning rubber gloves.
- c. Racks for holding brushes, dustpans, etc.
- d. Airing rack for dry cleaning cloths.
- e. Discarded line for covering furniture and storing materials.
- f. Adjustable ladders for public areas.
- g. Chandelier shampoo tent.
- h. Waterproof tarp used for mixing cleaning solutions.

All-Purpose Gloves

## Cleaning Methods

<!-- image -->

To familiarise readers with different surfaces found in a hotel and the methods to clean them.

## IntroductIon

One of the main functions of housekeeping is to clean various surfaces in a hotel. The chart below shows the number of surfaces that are used in hotel interiors. Housekeepers have tried and tested various methods of cleaning them over the years. The methods given below are the traditional ones that use items commonly available. These gives housekeepers greater freedom when certain modern brands of detergent are not in stock. With the advancement of science and technology, there are now ready-made solutions for cleaning available in the local supermarket. A housekeeper must assess the brands available for her use on a regular basis.

The choice of cleaning method depends on various factors as listed below:

- 1.  The nature of soil.
- 2.  The nature of the surface that is soiled.
- 3.  The properties of cleaning agents suitable for the surface.
- 4.  The best way to clean without dispersing dust to other areas.
- 5.  Cost effectiveness in terms of materials and labour time.
- 6.  The method should restore the surface to its original sheen and colour.

While the methods used have to be viewed individually, depending upon the surface, there are some general principles that can be applied to all cleaning:

- 1.  Remove loose dust and litter before the start of cleaning procedures.
- 2.  Use lighter cleaning methods first before stronger methods.
- 3.  Use clean and dry duster cloths and linen before using them.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Choose the simplest methods when in doubt.
- 5. Use abrasives as a last resort as they can damage the surface.
- 6. Use an agent that is the least offensive in smell if alternatives are available.
- 7. Be cautious of spoiling the surrounding areas when cleaning a surface, e.g. fingerprints on walls, grazing other articles.
- 8. Use methods that pose least inconvenience to guests. Guests are disturbed by noise, smell or cleaning materials lying loosely in public areas.
- 9. Be sure that during the process of cleaning, areas do not create accident hazards, e.g. wet floors, greasy surfaces, obstacles in the way, etc.
- 10. Plan cleaning to ensure the least time.
- 11. Clean periodically to ensure a sparkling house.
- 12. Train staff in cleaning methods and cleaning agents, e.g. using of gloves, masks, etc.

One of the crucial items in any cleaning is water. The role of water is:

- 1. To hold and remove dirt as in rinsing.
- 2. To break down dirt and grease and hold it in suspension, as done with detergents.
- 3. To emulsify grease and hold in suspension as done alkalis.

With these principles in mind, we are ready to tackle the cleaning of various surfaces given below.

## CLEANING METHODS

With these principles in mind, let's discuss them one by one to tackle the cleaning of various surfaces.

## Floors

Floors in this section refer to uncarpeted floors like concrete, linoleum,  tiles,  etc.  which  have  their  advantages  and disadvantages over carpets.

## Advantages of Non-carpeted Floors:

They are:

- More durable
- Sanitary
- Immune to static electricity
- Ideal for heavy traffic of people, equipment and vehicles
- Less vulnerable to moisture
- Do not breed micro-organisms
- Preferred in moisture prone areas like bathrooms, kitchens and laundries

## Disadvantages of Non-carpeted Floors:

They are:

- Noisier and unsuitable for guest rooms or meeting rooms
- Slippery especially when wet and therefore pose a hazard
- Require constant mopping, sweeping and occasionally buffing and waxing

## Types of Floors

Basically, there are three types of floors:

Hard Floors

Wood Floors

## Resilient Floors

Hard floors are made from stone or clay. They include  concrete,  marble,  granite,  terrazzo, ceramic tiles and natural stone. They are the most durable of all  floors.  Hotels  will  use  concrete in  driveways,  porches,  car  parks,  stewarding, laundry, etc. where heavy traffic is expected.

<!-- image -->

- Marble, terrazzo and granite come in many colours and give a grand finish to surfaces. They are therefore preferred for counter tops, decorative walls, and select lobby floors. They come in glossy finish or mat finish to suit the décor style. They need less care to retain their gloss. They are however expensive as they have to be quarried and finished in size and face for commercial use.
- Terrazzo is made from small chips of marble and bound together to give an attractive look. They come in tiles.
- Ceramic tile is made from a combination of marble, clay, slate, glass or flint. It is very durable and easy to maintain. Slate comprises the natural stone and comes in slices. It is used for roofing and heavy flooring.

Wood floors are differentiated between hardwoods and softwoods.

- Hardwoods are teak, ebony, and maple and are expensive. They are used for furniture mostly and for exclusive floors. Oak wood is cheaper and therefore chosen for wooden flooring.
- Softwoods such as pine and cork give a springy tread but they create dents and scratches.
- Other variants of wood flooring are
- (a) Parquet  floors  that  are  wood  tiles  of maple and oak usually.
- (b) Wood blocks resemble butcher cutting blocks but come in tiles. They are used where heavy wear and tear is expected.
- (c) Wooden planks come in varying sizes and can be used for flooring.

<!-- image -->

The chopping of wood is controlled in many states because of fears of deforestation and therefore difficult to get for large-scale use. Purchases should be legitimate sources. Wood flooring is therefore used only for decorative purposes as in bars, corporate meeting rooms and lounges.

Resilient floors are  springy  and  therefore  used  extensively. They  include vinyl, asphalt, rubber and linoleum.

- Vinyl surfaces can be protected with wax for heavy use and therefore used extensively. Since they are non-porous and sound absorbent, they are preferred for flooring. They come in many colours.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- Asphalt is resistant to decay and mildew and fire. They are used on driveways and rooftops.
- Rubber flooring is used in areas that require sound absorption. They act as good underlay to conference halls and restaurants. Rubber is however expensive and since it is inflammable, is least used.
- Linoleum is the most popular in this category. They are cheap in cost and come in many colours. Linoleum is made from linseed oil, ground cork or wood, mineral fillers and resins. They may have a felt backing for extra spring. While linoleum is easy to maintain, it cannot take heavy traffic and wear easily. They are not used in luxury settings.

## Metals

Metals are alloys of different types of metals.

- Hard metals like  iron  and  steel  are  used  as  building  materials  to  give  construction strength.

## Cleaning Methods

<!-- image -->

- White metals are more decorative and malleable for special shapes required for hotel use. For example, stainless steel requires the combination of steel, nickel and chromium. Kitchens use stainless steel for table tops and utensils. Their cleaning is under kitchen stewarding and not under the housekeeping.
- Brassware is used for decorative purposes like lamps and flowerpots.
- Chrome is used for interiors of elevators.
- Cast iron is used for banister railings, etc.

Given below are the different types of metals commonly used in hotel interiors that are cleaned by the housekeeping department:

## Furniture

Furniture consists of beds, tables, chairs, cabinets, etc. It has the following uses and benefits:

- It is necessary for living comforts and convenience.
- It is a means of beautifying rooms and is an integral part of themes of restaurants, lobbies and rooms.
- It  is  expensive  because  they  are  mostly  made  of wood and therefore used to enhance decor. There are  alternatives  nowadays in glass, metal, plastic and other materials shown in the chart below.

<!-- image -->

- It has a longer life than any other type.

The choice of furniture is made by the interior designer at the inception of the hotel. Furniture can range from the classical Louis XIV furniture to the practical Scandinavian assembled types. Once bought, they have to be maintained so as to prolong the use of this asset. The chart below gives the type of wood and how they are maintained. Lesson 12 'Layout of a Guest Room and Amenities' details the furniture found in a room.

## Ceilings & Walls

Nowadays there is a variety of ceiling and wall surface finishes. They include wood, carpet, wall paper, fabric, stone, marble, granite, ceramic tiles and the most common - paint.

- Wood comes in the form of plyboard for partitions and wood panels. This is used for offices, function rooms and wood specific log chalets. Wood gives a cosy and exclusive ambience. Their upkeep is done by polishing the wood; applying varnish when stains arise; or by just plain dusting with a cloth or feather duster.
- Stone, granite and marble wall finishes are used by luxury hotels for exterior surfaces and lobbies. They are more durable and give a rich look to a property. They can be washed, mopped and scrubbed to maintain the freshness.
- Ceramic tiles are extensively used in bathrooms, kitchens, receiving areas, laundries and pool sides. They are most effective where surfaces are exposed to water. Tiles can be washed with soap solutions and mopped dry.
- Wallpaper is used in smaller traditional properties especially the bed and breakfast variety. They come in many designs and colours. Wall paper can be dusted daily with a feather duster. They have the danger of staining or guests leaving soil imprints. Rooms with wallpaper in busy hotels will require constant changing. The challenge is whether the particular design is available all the time.

- Paint by far is the most popular surface finish. With the advance of technology, there are paints to suit every kind of environment and budget. There is the plastic emulsion paint that can be washed easily and is resistant to wind, air and dust. Most guest rooms and public areas are painted as the cheapest and most durable surface finish. Painted surfaces can be touched up or re-painted whenever the need arises.
- Vinyl manufacturers have introduced revolutionary ceiling and wall finishes. They come in attractive colours and designs. They are a viable alternative to paint. The product is made by laminating vinyl to a cotton or polycotton backing. Polycotton backing is less flammable

<!-- image -->

and more durable than cotton is therefore most preferred. Vinyl  comes  in  rolls and pasted onto the wall with a special adhesive. It is mounted on ceilings and

<!-- image -->

walls by specialists. The challenge to housekeepers is the growth of mildew in wet climates. Mildew loosens the vinyl from the adhesive creating ripples in the vinyl. Vinyl can be scrubbed with brushes and soap solutions and even stronger detergents. The manufacturers are the best to suggest the appropriate cleaning agent for the particular vinyl chosen.

- Fabric surfaces naturally are the most luxurious looking but they are difficult to install, hard to maintain, and easily damaged. They are also very expensive. Fabric surface finishes come in cotton, wool and silks. Sometimes two or more materials are combined to give it a unique appearance. Fabric wall coverings may be paper or acrylic backed. Acrylic backed fabric backing is preferred as it wrinkles less and easier to install. Fabric surfaces are vacuumed regularly and stains and spots removed by conventional methods used on fabrics.

Basic principles of cleaning ceilings and walls are:

- 1. Check with the manufacturer for the best cleaning solution for the surface.
- 2. Check cleaning solutions that are multipurpose for a wide variety of surfaces.
- 3. Choose nontoxic, biodegradable and odourless chemicals that are safe for guests.
- 4. Choose safe equipment like ladders and scaffolds. It is preferable that they do not have to use them by having mops and sprays with long handles to reach vents and corners.
- 5. Furniture, carpets and fixtures must be covered with discarded linen before cleaning ceilings and walls.
- 6. It is preferable to use suction equipment than scrubbing ones  to  prevent  any  damage  and  scrapes  to  the surfaces.

## Windows

Windows are essential features of hotel construction. They come in all shapes and sizes from the small windows of bathrooms to bay-windows in guest rooms. Today there are reliable glass-cleaning detergents found in the supermarket that can be sprayed and cleaned with hand held squeegees.

<!-- image -->

## Cleaning Methods

Exterior  cleaning  of  glaze  windows  is  a  specialist  job  often  given  to contractors. It involves suspending carriages from the roof by cables for cleaners to access the windows from the outside. It is a hazardous job and the specialists know the precautions required for a safe operation.

Windows are incomplete without the shades to give privacy and protect interiors from sunlight. Window shades come in different materials:

- Vinyl blinds must be dusted daily with a feather duster. They can be also washed with soap solutions. Vinyl blinds are used in offices and low cost guest rooms.
- Drapes (fabric curtains) are preferred in hotels because they are sound absorbent and give a luxurious look. Drapes can be cleaned with special drape vacuum cleaners.

<!-- image -->

All curtains in the hotel must be sent for periodic dry-cleaning and washing. They pose a challenge for the housekeeper as she has to block those areas from use. If the area is revenue generating, like guest rooms, food outlets and function rooms, the task gets more critical. The housekeeper will either

have a spare set of curtains to hang or choose those lean times in a week or year to close down those areas for spring cleaning. The housekeeper must make sure at the time of purchase that the window fabrics can be maintained easily and inexpensively. Some fabrics do not respond well to washing, spotting or vacuuming. These need to be tested before they are subject to such treatment. Drapes can fade, bleed of colour, or shrink. The best fabrics chosen for hotels are those that can be washed. Nowadays windows are lined with cotton fabric to save them from exposure to sunlight resulting in the fabric becoming brittle or losing colour. Linings must be pre-shrunk before they are sewn onto curtains. In case it is prudent to dry-clean such curtains to prevent further shrinkage.

The manner in which window curtains are hung or opened poses a problem to housekeepers. They are either hung on curtain rings  along  curtain  rods  or  by  curtain  hooks  that  move  along channels. Daily cleaners need to check these are secure and send maintenance request for defective ones. A window shade that cannot open prevents daily guest room cleaning that requires the room attendant to open it for airing the room.

Upmarket hotels also provide sheer curtains as a back-up to heavy curtains. These curtains are meant to let the sunlight in during the day, while heavy drapery is drawn for the night, mainly to give privacy to the room occupants.

## Carpets

Carpets are expensive assets to hotels. They feature in capital budgets as owners treat them as investments that will serve the hotel for long periods. Care is taken in the selection and the laying of carpets in guest rooms and public areas. The decision to purchase carpets is made by a senior committee which includes the general manager, investor, interior decorator and the executive

<!-- image -->

housekeeper. Decisions on carpets have a longstanding impact; hence it is important that such decisions are correct ones. The main considerations are durability, appearance and ease of maintenance. Since floor coverings, cleaning agents and maintenance equipment keep improving each year, those responsible for their purchase, primarily the executive housekeeper, has to survey the market frequently. For example, they may select equipment that has dual use on carpets and floors. Being valuable assets their care and maintenance have to be regular and follow the correct procedure.

## Types of Carpets

Carpets serve many purposes:

- (a) They give the area a plush look;
- (b) They are sound absorbent, ideal for guest rooms, meeting rooms and offices;
- (c) They keep rooms warm and are valuable in cold climates; and
- (d) They prevent slipping and therefore are preferred in corridors and stairs apart from rooms.

- 3. They are water responsive therefore suitable for wet cleaning.
- 4. They are not highly inflammable.
- 5. They absorb sound well.
- 6. They are ideal for guest rooms and luxury hotels in general.

## Disadvantages

<!-- image -->

- 1. They are expensive.

- They are different varieties of synthetic carpets:
- (a) Synthetic category of carpets include nylon which cleans easily and less expensive;
- (b) Acrylic looks like wool but less easy to clean and less resilient;
- (c) Polypropylene is more sturdy and resistant to strong cleaning solutions, however they wear easily;
- (d) Polyesters look like wool and are durable and clean easily. They come in endless rolls and therefore have the advantage of fitting them to any room size. However, they wear easily;
- (e) Acetate is a cost-effective silky fibre that is fast in colour and resistant to mildew, but wear easily and can get damaged with strong detergents;
- (f) Rayon , which has poor resistance to soil and abrasion but has colour retention and resistance to mildew.

- 2. They do not last long.
- 3. They have less resistance as the thickness is smaller than those of woollen carpets.

## Carpet Cleaning

The main objective of carpet cleaning is to give carpets a long life. Since this one item is so expensive, it is treated as an asset that deserves a special care. Housekeepers are advised to have an annual carpet maintenance programme. Such a programme will have the following elements:

- 1. Daily inspection and cleaning: All carpets are vacuumed or brushed daily especially where there is heavy traffic locating spots and stains that have occurred in the last 24 hours that is attended to immediately so that they do not become permanent.
- 2. Weekly cleaning schedules go beyond just vacuuming. It could include carpet shampooing; spot cleaning and stain removal.
- 3. Preventive maintenance: The  best  way  to  give  carpets  a  longer  life  is  by  a  preventive maintenance programme. It is better to forestall damage than respond to it. Carpets are shampooed periodically; aired to keep them dry to avoid mildew; furniture moved so that they do not create permanent indents; underlay provided to protect carpets from surface water seepage and pests; pest control programmes; using runner and mats in heavy traffic areas; and regular vacuuming of carpets.

Carpet cleaning is done by several methods:

Dry Vacuuming Method: The vacuum cleaner is the principle machine for cleaning carpets as it lifts piles, levels them in one movement, and sucks dust completely. Some modern vacuum cleaners have a 'combination floor nozzle' that cleans floors as well as carpets at the drop of a switch. Whenever one uses the nozzle for carpets, move against the pile first and then along with the pile to remove hidden soil lodged inside the carpet piles. Use smooth brisk movements with downward pressure for smoothening and positioning the piles. Take care to empty out the vacuum cleaner dust bag often, avoid dust congestion in the bag. Congestion stops the suction.

Hot Water Extraction: Hot water extraction is sometimes referred to as 'steam cleaning'. Actually this is a misnomer as real steam on carpets is too dry and hot to clean the carpet properly. In this method, spray hot cleaning solution under pressure onto the carpet and immediately extract with a vacuum source. Flush the dirty solution, collected in a recovery tank, into the waste water system of the hotel. The advantage of this method is that it has the ability to flush out large amounts of contaminants in the carpet. It is the most preferred method and has the deepest cleaning action most suited to carpets with thick piles.

Shampooing: This method involves wetting the carpet and shampooing it. The equipment used is a motorised circular brush that injects cleaning solution at pressure into carpets that loosen and

## Cleaning Methods

<!-- image -->

seek the dirt out. The resultant dirt solution is sucked from the surface with another equipment. This method relies on vacuuming after the shampoo dries. The method is quick but does not clean all the dirt lodged deep inside piles. It is therefore not recommended for thick piled carpets. It has very good agitation and is best suited for low commercial carpets or low cut pile carpets that are highly soiled.

## Carpet Shampooing Procedure

- 1. Remove carpet from the room and spread it upside down on an open concrete surface.
- 2. Beat out dust with a carpet beater covering all areas of the carpet at least three times.
- 3. Roll the carpet and remove loose dust from the surface underneath with a soft broom.
- 4. Roll out carpet with the correct side up.
- 5. Apply shampoo with the shampoo machine using slow circular motions. A carpet specialist will prescribe the correct brands suited for the carpet. Readymade shampoos are available in the market.
- 6. Extra shampoo foam is removed with the carpet brush.
- 7. The carpet is left in the sun to dry.

Bonnet Method (Dry-Cleaning): This method is another wet cleaning method with a difference. It injects the cleaning solution mist into the carpet in the form of a spray and allowed to soak for a short while. It is then buffed with a rotary machine with absorbent pad that agitates the surface of the pile. Pads are made of synthetic or natural fibres and can be laundered and re-used. The method has the advantage of drying very quickly because of less moisture used. It generally cleans well the top one-third of the carpet visible to the naked eye. But it does very little to the grit and sand lodged deep in the pile that damage the carpet over time. Because there is no flushing action or extraction, there is very little deep cleaning involved. This method may be considered as an interim cleaning between more effective methods.

Dry Foam Method: This method is similar to shampooing where the brushing action is aggressive, with counter rotating cylindrical brushes. The method uses a high foam shampoo detergent with less liquid. It is applied by a rotary machine with a brush that suspends soils and emulsifies oils. The resultant liquid on the carpet is sucked out by a wet vacuum cleaner. Like shampooing it is not a suitable method for thick pile carpets.

Manual Method: This is a method using the carpet brush and dustpan. It is recommended to brush against the piles to make them stand. This gives a springy feeling when one treads on them. Use brisk movements between piles to scoop out dust. Collect the dust in dustpans and empty it in garbage bags after every room. Carpet brushing is preferred to noisy vacuum cleaners to avoid disturbance to sleeping guests especially in the night and early mornings.

<!-- image -->

Dry Powder Cleaning Method: In this method dry powder or crystals are sprinkled on the carpet and worked into the pile with a hand brush. The powder absorbs soils which are later removed by vacuuming the carpet surface. This method is ideal for high traffic areas that cannot be obstructed for long.

## Special Points for Carpet Cleaning

Carpets can be a housekeeper's nightmare. Firstly, owners expect them to last from 7 to 10 years being expensive assets. Secondly, they are highly visible and therefore have to be as fresh and clean as possible over the years. Thirdly, carpet cleaning requires shutting down those areas for business,

leading to a loss of revenue. The task of keeping them clean is challenging by the amount of traffic on them and then the stains,  drips  and  spills  that  occur  daily  wherever  there  is traffic. Then, in wet weathers carpets especially those with natural fibres are breeding grounds for microorganisms like germs, bacteria, moulds, spores, mildew and dust mites. This challenge can be met with some simple tips when cleaning carpets:

<!-- image -->

- 1. Pay attention to corners and under edges as dust normally collects there.
- 2. Install mats at entrances for guests to clear shoes of external dirt before entering carpeted areas.
- 3. Vacuum daily using the special features of various vacuum machines to serve their range of purposes.
- 4. Prepare a weekly and monthly preventive maintenance programme for the upkeep of carpets.

## Storage of Carpets

It is recommended that carpets should not be stored. However, due to room renovations; closing a resort facility during off season, etc., the housekeeper has to store carpets. Following procedure may be followed when storing carpets:

- 1. Pest control the storage area every third day.
- 2. The storage area should be a dry place.
- 3. Open out carpets preferably on a flat concrete surface to prevent pests cutting through it.
- 4. If carpets have to be rolled due to space restrictions, preferably open them every second day for air and to permit the piles to retain their natural flow.
- 5. Rolled up carpets must be wrapped with discarded linen or polythene sheets.

## Carpet Problems

A professional housekeeper has to know the problems she will face while maintaining the several square yards of carpets in the hotel. These problems may be classified as follows:

## Pile crushing

Piles which are the visible face of the fibres on the surface can twist, pill, crush, flare or mat, with heavy footfall or equipment. Piles can distort with aggressive cleaning methods. To avoid this, use runners (strips of heavy duty cloth) along the carpet; vacuum regularly; use pile lifters and carpet rakes; to prevent crushing.

## Shading

Shading occurs when carpet piles are brushed in two different directions giving the carpet separate colours. Some housekeepers reverse the pile to give the carpet a different colour. However, if at any point of time, it is desired to have a common colour, carpet piles may be vacuumed or brushed in one direction only.

<!-- image -->

## Fading

Colour fades through natural aging; regular exposure to sunlight; or by improper cleaning. Carpets in heavy traffic areas are bound to fade reduced by regular cleaning. To avoid fading, ensure the following:

- 1. Have regular cleaning schedules.
- 2. Keep carpets away from direct sunlight.
- 3. Avoid strong solutions for removing spots and stains.
- 4. Pre-test them for reactions to cleaning solutions before using them. This is achieved by testing solutions on one corner of the carpet or on cut samples retained for just this purpose.

However, if fading does take place there are professional dyers who refresh the carpet.

## Browning

Browning (or wicking) occurs when wet jute backing colour is absorbed by the carpet fibre bringing brown patches to the surface. Browning can be resolved by adding vinegar or synthetic citric acid to cleaning solutions. Check with the manufacturer when using new chemicals and pre-test them.

## Mildew

Mildew is a micro-organism that grows in natural fibres exposed to wet and humid conditions. Mildew causes staining, odour and rotting. Carpets must always be kept dry especially after wet treatment like shampooing.

## Pilling

Pilling is caused when pieces of face fibre are trapped in the carpet at the time of manufacturing. These pieces surface when the carpet is trod upon. It seems that the carpet is shedding its fibres when in fact it is only residual fibres caught in the pile giving the carpet an unkempt look. Frequent initial vacuuming sucks out these pieces out of the pile. A painstaking method is to pick and cut these loose fibres with a scissors.

they are applied.

## INTRODUCTION

Cleaning agents are critical aids to keep a sparkling house. Basically, the cleaning process is to remove dust and dirt. While normal dusting with a cloth or vacuum cleaner removes loose dust; cleaning agents are used for stubborn grit stains and tarnish. The cleaning agent basically holds the dirt or breaks it down to wash away in the rinsing process. Other agents dissolve grease or emulsify it to extract it  easily  from  a  surface.  Some  of  the  common  cleaning  agents  used  are discussed below.

## COMMONCLEANING AGENTS

## Water

Water is the most common agent used, as it is freely available. It is useful in rinsing and finishing cleaning processes. Water is of two types, hard water and soft water. Soft water is best for cleaning. Hardness in water is caused by the presence of mineral salts-calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), and also iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) that does not work well with detergents for effective cleaning.

Here are some tips when using water:

- 1. Replenish dirty water with fresh water because it could leave a film of dirt instead of removing it.
- 2. Use warm water preferably as it dissolves soap more readily than cold water.

## Liquid Cleaning Agents

While water is the king among liquid cleaning agents, we discuss here a few other traditional liquid cleaning agents that are either diluted in a little water or used directly with a dry cloth.

Ammonia is an alkali made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen. It is highly soluble and forms a solution called ammonium hydroxide (liquid ammonia). It is not too active when dry, but reacts with many chemicals in liquid form. It softens hard water and emulsifies grease.

Acetone is a volatile and inflammable liquid. It can damage most plastics. It is effective in removing paint stains, dyes and cosmetic smudges. It is recommended to do spot testing before full use to ascertain whether the surface will get damaged.

Benzene is a distillate of coal tar. It dissolves grease as well as paint and tar stains. It exudes powerful fumes and, therefore, is harmful for use. Protective masks are necessary.

Methylated spirits are derived from methanol-a type of alcohol used for industrial purposes. It is also called methyl alcohol or wood alcohol. It is flammable and highly poisonous. It has to be handled with extreme care. It reacts with various substances and is effective against grease stains.

Methalene chloride is a volatile liquid with a strong odour. It requires protective clothes and masks when in use. It is ideal for stripping sealants and paints as it possesses a strong solvent.

Paraffin is a white, partly clear, waxy solid that has no odour or taste. Paraffin forms a moisture proof film on surfaces. It is also grease solvent.

Turpentine is a colourless liquid with a strong odour. It is highly inflammable. It is used as a thinner for paints and varnishes. As a cleaning agent it is a grease and paint solvent ideal for removing paint and grease stains.

Vinegar is a sour liquid derived from wine-making. The French call it sour wine. While vinegar's use in food preservation and salads is well known, its commercial use has found its way to housekeeping cleaning chores. It acts as a mild acid unaffected by hard water and useful in removing light stains in baths.

White Spirit and Tetrachloroethylene are volatile liquids with the former being inflammable, used for spot cleaning to remove stains of wax, oils, fats, tar and rubber and resins. It cannot be used on PVC, rubber, plastic, thermoplastics and asphalt.

## Acids

Hydrochloric acid is useful in removing stubborn stains in bathrooms. Care must be taken in its use as it can burn the skin and destroy fabrics and light bathroom fittings. It is, therefore, diluted to avoid hazards. In any case, the houseman should wear protective clothing like aprons, gloves, goggles and face masks. It is also useful in cleaning metallic based stains like tarnish on silver and copper. It dissolves hard water deposits in drains and gutters.

Phosphoric acid and Oxalic acid are powerful mediums that require protective clothing. They are useful in removing rust and lime scale deposits.

Carbon tetrachloride is also excellent grease solvent. Care must be exercised there too as the fumes are harmful.

Acetic acid and Citric acid are milder acids for milder stains, especially in ornamental pieces like expensive branded sinks, baths and Jacuzzis.

## Washing Soda

This agent is vastly outdated due to the advent of innovative detergents like vim, etc. However, it is particularly useful for emulsifying grease on drain pipes, gutters or stone surfaces. In a strong concentration, it could be injurious to skin, fabrics, brushes, wood and paint. Washing soda is useful as a water softener.

## Soaps, Powders, Flakes

Detergents are found in the form of soaps, powders, flakes or liquid. A detergent is a compound or a combination of compounds that is used for cleaning. Detergents need water as an essential requirement to be effective. They are, therefore, made to be soluble in water. To remove challenging stains, certain other cleaning aids may be used in conjunction with detergents and water such as:

- 1. Surfactants to remove grease.
- 2. Abrasives to rub dirt off the surface.
- 3. The pH substances to stabilise other harder substances used in a compound detergent structure.
- 4. Caustics to break up dirt particles.
- 5. Softeners to deal with the harshness of other components being used.
- 6. Oxidisers for bleaching.
- 7. Enzymes, a relatively new component, added to destroy any accumulation of proteins, fats or carbohydrates in the form of dirt, especially in fabrics. Manufacturers are enhancing the cleaning experience with softeners, fragrances and foaming agents.

Soaps are used for washing and bathing and come in convenient palm sizes. They have greater lather and aroma and come in different colours for attractiveness.

Flakes are used for delicate fabrics as they dissolve quicker than soaps. They are also perfumed.

Powders also dissolve easily in water but are used mainly for washing machine-based cleaning. Bleach (sodium hypochloride) is commonly used for whitening sinks, tubs, W.C. bowls and fabrics.

Powders and flakes are useful in getting instant lather, but are expensive. When used, care should be taken that they are thoroughly dissolved. Being expensive, one should know exactly how much powder or flake is dissolved to get an optimum benefit as also how long the resultant solution is  effective.  Good bar soaps are still most economical, but much more strenuous than modern methodologies. They should be stored on open shelves in a dry store.

## Synthetic Detergents

Today soaps, powders and flakes are replaced by excellent synthetic soap-less detergents which are unaffected by hard water. They suspend dirt and grit most effectively without leaving a smear. They come with both acidic and alkaline bases for hard and light cleaning. They include glass cleaners

(with ethylene glycol); general purpose cleaners for hard surfaces; aerosol sprays to freeze solid items like gum; deodorants that lend an aroma to stale surroundings; disinfectants that kill microorganisms; and antiseptics to clean bodily features.

## Non-chemical Cleaning Methods

Sunlight kills surface bacteria. It is a good sanitiser.

Sterilisation kills  bacteria  by  heat.  It  is  ideal  for  sanitising  equipment  that  comes  in  human contact.

Freezing stunts growth of bacteria.

Filtration removes bacteria like air filters or vacuum filters.

## Abrasives

Abrasives are substances used to grind, smoothen, sharpen, and polish various materials. They come in the form of cream, pastes, powders, clay, nylon and steel wool. Common abrasives include alumina, emery, pumice, sand and silicon carbide. They are used in cases of very stubborn stains on various surfaces. Silver, sand, steel wool, glass paper may be used for removing stains on plain wood, stone or cement floors. Emery powder or paper is suitable for removing rust from steel. Pumice powder is used for removing stains from sinks and bath tubs. Whiting is a mild abrasive for cleaning white paint. Nylon scourers are made to have an abrasive effect and yet prove less damaging to surfaces. Primarily, the abrasive used is based on the type of surface and the stubbornness of the dirt or stain. Fine abrasives like jewellers rouge are used for delicate artefacts and equipment; medium abrasives are used for ceramics or china-based items; while stronger hard abrasives like steel wool, emerypaper and sandpaper are used on surfaces that have a higher resistance to getting scratched like stainless steel sinks, metal drainpipes, etc. Abrasives are normally used manually.

## Polishes

Polishes are used to bring shine to a surface. They also provide a protective layer to a surface like wood. Polishes fall into three types - liquid polishes, pastes and creams. These fall primarily into three broad categories spirit based , oil based and water based . Spirit based polishes are used for metal mirrors, window panes and Bakelite. Oil-based polishes are used for stains on wax polish or painted wood, linoleum and synthetic floorings with an oil or resinous base, cork or wood waste, leather and leather substitutes, tiles enamelled and lacquered metals. Water based polishes are used on sealed floors, thermoplastic floors and rubber flooring.

There are some basic principles applied in using polishes. They are:

- 1. Used only after dirt and dust on surfaces are thoroughly removed.
- 2. Used in small quantities as excessive polish could smear surfaces.
- 3. Used as a last resort only.
- 4. Rubbed off thoroughly as surfaces could then become sticky or greasy and thus show finger marks when touched.
- 5. Surfaces provided with permanent or semi-permanent polish sheens must be polished very carefully as the original sheen could be destroyed, e.g.
- (a) Avoid using wax polish on French polished surfaces.
- (b) Avoid wax polish on a floor treated with a shellac dressing (which is a semi-permanent polish).

## Cleaning Agents

- (c) Avoid metal polishes on chromium-plated or lacquered metals.
- (d) Store correctly and control use of polishes as they are expensive.
- (e) Use polish machines on large floor surfaces as they are more economical and quicker than hand polish.

## Seals

Seals are meant to provide a flush finish to porous surfaces like wooden floors or concrete. They can either be water or resin based. The resin based ones oleo-resin, one pot plastic or two pot plastic are ideal for wooden surfaces. Pigmented seal are used on concrete.

## SELECTION OF CLEANING AGENTS - GENERAL PRINCIPLES

- 1. Use agents that do not damage the surface. For this, spot testing of a surface is recommended before full-scale use, especially in the case of volatile detergents. Often, the manufacturer gives directions to the type of surface the detergent is best for.
- 2. Use mild rather than strong agents as they are less injurious to surfaces.
- 3. Issue protective clothing when using volatile agents.
- 4. Use pure agents. There are cheap substitutes that might show immediate results but on a long run may damage surfaces as they are likely to contain strong chemicals and abrasives.
- 5. Buy polishes in manageable containers as bulk purchases could cause congestion in stores. The containers must have reliable lids, corks, etc. as defective ones could result in wastage due to evaporation and drying.
- 6. Use multi-purpose polishes as managing too many polishes requires more supervision.
- 7. Avoid strong smelling agents (e.g. paraffin) due to the offensive smells they lend to the environment.
- 8. Purchase cost-effective brands.
- 9. Follow manufacturer's directions when using a cleaning agent.

## INTRODUCTION

Pest control is a programme of eradicating pests using pesticides. Some of the common pests seen in hotel operations are cockroaches, flies, spiders, moths, termites, bedbugs, mites, ants and rodents. Most pests are attracted to food or water. Termites are attracted to cellulose found in wood and paper, while bedbugs feed on human blood. However, a comprehensive list is given below with solutions to manage them. A pesticide is, therefore, a chemical used to eliminate pests. Insects are probably the major pests that transmit diseases, such as malaria and typhus. Some insects destroy or cause heavy damage to valuable vegetation. Other common pests include bacteria, fungi, and weeds such as poison ivy and ragweed. Manufacturers use various chemicals in making pesticides.

## TYPES OF PESTICIDES

Pesticides are classified according to the pests they control. The four most widely used types of pesticides are:

- Insecticides
- Herbicides
- Fungicides
- Rodenticides

<!-- image -->

## Insecticides

Hotel gardeners use insecticides to protect their plants from insect damage. Public health officials use these chemicals to fight mosquitoes and other insects. Insecticides are used in hotels to control such pests as ants, flies, spiders, moths, cockroaches and termites.

## Herbicides

These chemicals are used to control weeds or other unwanted plants. Herbicides are used by hotel gardeners to reduce weeds, crab grass and dandelions among their plants. Herbicides are also used in recreational areas like gardens, ponds and lakes.

## Fungicides

<!-- image -->

Certain fungus are pathogenic (disease causing) and may infect plants, animals and human beings. Fungicides are sprayed or dusted to kill fungal growths like rusts, mildew, smuts and moulds. Fabrics are treated with fungicides to prevent rotting. Most disinfectants used in hotels use fungicides.

## Rodenticides

Rodenticides are chemicals used in areas infested with rats and other rodents which are health hazards. Rats carry diseases such as rabies, rat bite fever, tularemia and typhus. Rats also destroy food and grain in hotel dry stores. Rodenticides help in eliminating such pets in prone areas of the hotel like kitchens and stores.

## About Pesticides

Pesticides differ according to their effects on various organisms. Selective pesticides are toxic only to the target pests. These are largely preferred in  hotels. They cause little  or  no  harm  to  other  organisms.  However, non-selective pesticides can harm or even kill organisms that are not considered pests. Non-selective pesticides should be used only when no other method of control is available.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Over time certain pests like rats and mosquitoes have developed a resistance to pesticides. Manufacturers are producing new chemicals and methods to control them. For example, cockroach eradicators know the exact crevices and cracks where cockroaches breed and are able to inject a smart gel with a syringe in those areas. Smart gel is an odourless cockroach control treatment that does not require vacation of the premises as done in messy fumigation. Cockroaches get attracted to the gel, eat it and die. Similarly, termi-freeze is a chemical (Imidacloprid) treatment for termites. Contractors bore holes in the junctions of walls and pillars and inject this chemical. Termites which can travel upwards to several floors are trapped by these chemicals.

## PEST CONTROL PROGRAMME

The most effective and safe method of executing a pest control programme is by employing wellqualified professional exterminators on a contract basis. The contract is based on the layout of the property, the area to be covered and complexity of the problem. For example, project sites will have greater challenges as large areas are exposed to the elements. The housekeeping department is reposed with the responsibility of ensuring the pest control programme. Pest control schedules have to be carefully planned as those areas are cordoned of for hours to have the desired effect. For

example, guest rooms are fumigated every month while food and beverage areas have their own convenient schedules. Areas that need special attention are floor pantries, non-food stores, linen rooms, locker rooms, cafeteria and garbage areas. The engineering department is co-opted to access drains and gutters. Modern pest control methods include non-pervasive items that do not require the closing down of facilities. Professional pest-control contractors know the habits of various pests and are able to isolate breeding grounds and capture them there.

However, pest control contractors cannot be expected to maintain the premises absolutely insectfree without the supplemental support and assistance of hotel personnel. One of the methods of a pest control programme is prevention . By studying the habits of targeted pests, one can ensure adequate measure to avoid attracting them. For example, ants, cockroaches and mice look for food. If food areas are sanitised properly after operations, it is unlikely to attract the pests. Similarly, termites attack wood. Therefore, furniture needs to be treated with anti-termite chemicals to prevent termites from damaging the woodwork.

The residual insecticides necessary for a successful campaign against these insects are relatively toxic and must be handled with great care. It is recommended that they be used only by professional exterminators unless the hotel has in its employment an individual who is trained in their use. They must also be stored in special areas away from human contact and food.

Cleanliness and constant vigilance, particularly in handling food, refuse and garbage is the best defence against rodents. All containers of these items should be clean and tightly covered and should be in metal. Wire enclosures should be used for dry food stuffs in cartons and bags. This procedure plus periodic campaigns by the contract exterminators should keep the hotel free of rats and mice.

Outdoor areas are more susceptible to pests than indoor areas. Therefore, one has to determine the acceptable level pests in outdoor locations. A programme of suppression of pests limits the pests as they cannot be completely eradicated.

For this reason, it is recommended that all maids carry insecticide sprays on their carts and use them routinely when cleaning guest rooms and terraces. Recommended insecticides are harmless to human beings and animals, but it should be kept away from food stuffs. These insecticides do not have a residual life and are, therefore, effective against a great many crawling insects, cockroaches in particular, on direct contact.

## PEST CONTROL EQUIPMENT

Food Operations areas like kitchens use pest control equipment like insectocutors in kitchens to attract and eliminate, through electrocution, mosquitoes, moths, wasps, beetles, flies and other photopositive flying insects.

<!-- image -->

Rodents are  snared  by  mechanical traps, slow poison traps and glue traps (using Bromodioline).

<!-- image -->

## Pest Control

Modern techniques use rat  ultrasonic  machines ,  which  use vibrations to keep rats and mice away. These units are very compact, safe, noiseless, environmental friendly and non-irritating pest repellers.

Air Curtains at doorways help keep flying insects from entering indoor areas like kitchens, pantries, food receiving areas  and  cafeterias. They  also  help maintain temperatures indoors from harsh outside temperatures.

## Control of Odours

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To  help  the  readers  learn  how  to  control  odours  in  a  cleaning

## INTRODUCTION

Odours are a great challenge to housekeepers who are responsible to give the hotel a fresh environment. While the term 'odour' refers to both pleasant and foul smells, one uses terms such as scent, fragrance and aroma to pleasant odour; and the terms like stink and, stench are used for foul odours. This lesson deals with the control of foul odours. While dirt offends the eye, odours offend the nose. Sometimes the source of odours is far removed from the odour as it is invisible and permeated the air easily. Odour control depends on cleanliness, which is the housekeeping function, and on ventilation which is a maintenance department function.

It has been proposed that there are seven primary odours:

- 1. Musky-perfumes/aftershave
- 2. Putrid-rotten eggs
- 3. Pungent-vinegar
- 4. Camphoraceous-mothballs
- 5. Ethereal-dry cleaning fluid
- 6. Floral-roses
- 7. Pepperminty-mint gum

## CONCEPTOF FOULODOUR

Odour is the manipulation of receptors in our nose, by the reactive gaseous molecules present in the air.

An odour becomes foul when a smell is out of context to a situation. Reactions to a foul odour range from a simple irritation to severe sickness and vomiting. Therefore, foul odour is a psychosocial matter. For example, an odour can be accepted as a 'pleasant' in a certain situation whereas the

same odour can be perceived as a 'foul' in another situation. Some remarkable examples can be explained as follows:

Many non-cheese enthusiasts explain the smell of some kinds of cheese as foul as foot smell. However, the smell of camembert or brie cheese can be found very pleasant by people who are cheese lovers. The remarkable truth is that the same agents that cause the cheese smell and the foot smell.

In another example, rotten fish generates a disgusting odour. In spite of this, many tourists are fond of the far eastern rancid fish sauces.

Odours of onion, garlic, etc. are found to be appetising for anyone who is about to start a meal. However, after taking a full meal, a person finds the same odours unbearable.

## CLASSIFICATION OF ODOURS

Only a limited part of an odour molecule stimulates the nose receptors that send odour signal to the brain. Referring to the active material in it, we can classify the foul odours into three types.

Fatty acids: Sour odours, sweat odours, olive oil processing industries odours, etc. can be named in this class. Generally, the source of this kind of an odour is rancidity. This class of odour is least problematic and can be dealt with refresheners.

Sulphur compounds: These odours are generally formed of organic sulphite and mercaptan. They are caused by sources like anaerobic reactions, rotten zucchini and similar plants, decay of dead bodies.

Nitrogen compounds: These odours are generally caused by amines. Practically they are generated from rotten fish, dead bodies, urine and etc. sources.

Besides the above classification of odours, in some rare cases the nitrogen in the reactive part of some of the odour molecules is replaced by phosphor and the sulphur is replaced by selenium. In such cases the odour is even stronger and irresistible.

The table below describes the chemicals that cause a type of odour.

In practice, a foul odour is formed by a combination of sulphur and nitrogen molecules making the odour complex, requiring multiple treatments to eliminate it.

| Molecule          | Chemical               | Smell              |
|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Methyl Sulphide   | Rotten zucchini        | Sulphur Compounds  |
| Methyl Disulphide |                        | Onion              |
| Butyl Mercaptan   |                        | Polecat            |
| Trimethylamine    | Rotten fish            | Nitrogen Compounds |
| Indole            |                        | Faeces             |
|                   | Tetramethylene diamine | Rotten meat        |

## PRINCIPLES OF ODOUR ELIMINATION

Neutralisation: The agent used must target the odour molecule in the stinking object. The agent must lock the foul odour molecule and blocks its structure capable of stimulating the receptors in the nose.

Balancing: The fragrances of different refresheners oppose targeted foul odour by certain formula. These fragrances act like a jammer for the foul odour and in a meaning, confuse the message sent to the receptors in nose by the foul odour. This makes a polishing effect by preventing the perception of the foul odour.

Settling: Odour control uses misting systems, the mist created captures the foul odour molecules and slowly settles down. With this effect very similar to the effect of rain in the atmosphere, air is washed by a mixture of water having a fantastic odour control.

Breakdown: Enzymes bacterial and other components in the formula of certain types of odour control formula completely break down the odour molecule.

As the result of three actions and combinations of them, foul odours are degraded below the perceptible level for human being.

## COMMONTYPESOFODOURS IN HOTELS AND MODERN METHODSTO ELIMINATE THEM

The common types of odours in hotels are:

- 1. Dead rodent odour
- 2. Urine odour
- 3. New carpet odour
- 4. Cigarette smoke odour
- 5. Musty mildew odours (in basements)
- 6. Locker room and gym odours
- 7. Garbage room odour

## Modern Odour Elimination Methods

- 1. Dead Rodent Odour: Rodents can die in air-conditioning ducts, under furniture or in drawers. Often the housekeeper is unable to find the carcass to remove it. Today, Odour Remover Bags are used by pest control professionals to remove dead rodent odours, and urine and faeces odours associated with rodents. With these bags, the carcass does not have to be removed to eliminate the odours neither do the bags need to come in contact with them. The bag is simply hung near the odour and in 24 hours the odour disappears. Natural minerals in the bag act like magnets by attracting and neutralising smells. These bags are non-toxic and biodegradable and safe for the environment. It is also safe around children and pets, even if eaten.
- 2. Urine Odour: Urine odour is one of the strongest and toughest odours to get rid of. Most products available in the market are wet products and must come into contact with the urine to remove the odour. Especially, urine soaked into the carpet by children requires one to pull up the carpet and pad and soak the carpet in a detergent. Nowadays, there are Urine Odour Eliminators in the form of granules made from natural minerals. Just sprinkle the granules on

## Control of Odours

top of the carpet, leave it overnight and vacuum in the morning and the odour is completely eliminated. It works well on all surfaces pulling the odours out of tile and concrete. Urine odours in urinals can use these granules or naphthalene balls.

- 3. New Carpet Odour: Some new carpets contain volatile organic compounds which emit gases called 4-phenylcyclohexene (4-PCH), which is a by-product of the latex binder used to secure the 'tufted' fibres to the carpet backing. With this gas, which can linger for a week after installation, people may experience a wide range of symptoms including nose and throat discomfort, headache, allergic skin reaction, nausea, fatigue and dizziness. Today natural mineral granules are available that attract and neutralise the odour. The granules are spread across the carpet and left for 24 hours. It is recommended to have a window opened during this time. The carpet is later vacuumed. To get best results,  hang  three  or  four  Odour  Removal  Bags mentioned earlier.
- 4. Cigarette Smoke Odours: Cigarette  smoke  permeates  into furniture,  carpets,  walls,  windows  and  just  about  every  other nook and cranny in the room, making it particularly difficult to eliminate. Air Odour Eliminators will pull the smoke odours out of carpets, drapes, furniture, clothing and bedding without coming into  contact  them. The  odours  are  adsorbed,  and  neutralised without any fragrances.
- 5. Mildew Odours: Mildew odours are found in stores shut for long periods or basements not visited frequently. Hang 1-2 Odour Remover Bags in the basement. One bag covers up to 100 square feet. The Bags will continue to eliminate musty odours for up to 3 months.
- 6. Locker Room and Gym Odours: Locker rooms and gyms are frequently a source of foul odours. These odours range from uniforms and gym bags, sweaty clothes, mould and mildew from the shower rooms, perspiration odours and odours from sports equipment. Odour Remover Bags can easily and economically remove these odours.
- 7. Garbage Room Odour: Wet  garbage  rooms are usually airconditioned or air cooled to keep discarded vegetables, fruit peels and leftover food items fresh till the dumpster arrives to remove them away. Odour Remover Bags are easy to use. Just hang them in the dumpster room and they will completely eliminate the odours.

## SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Smoke from kitchens, bar odours and food odours can be controlled by adequate ventilation to secure optimum results. The maintenance department must constantly attend to the cleanliness and good operation of ducts and fans. Filters must be changed frequently. Air handling grills and louvres must be kept clean and unobstructed.

<!-- image -->

Housekeeping staff should be supplied with prescribed air-refresheners which counter musty and stale odours in a room. However, this is only complementary to actual housekeeping practices such as:

- (a) allowing fresh air into a room by opening windows and allowing it to breathe;
- (b) drying wet carpets by sunning them;
- (c) following accepted cleaning methodology especially in bathrooms;
- (d) throwing away residual food (coordination with the room service for the clearance of trays, etc.) is essential as deteriorating food could lend a stink to the immediate environs;
- (e) taking particular care in the cleaning of nooks and crannies and under furniture for it is here that debris can lie for days.

## LAUNDRY SERVICES

Figure 26.1 illustrates the different departments and people that depend on the laundry.

<!-- image -->

## Organisation of the Laundry Department

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To  help  the  readers  understand  how  a  laundry  department  is the laundry department.

## INTRODUCTION

The laundry department is critical to the success of a housekeeping department. It is responsible to wash the tons of soiled linen and uniforms that are generated daily. The supply of fresh linen is crucial to be able to make rooms available for sale or for food and banquet outlets to be ready to sell their food and beverage services. In other words, the revenue generating capacity is greatly enhanced or impaired by the efficiency of the laundry services. A hotel has the following two options when providing laundry service:

- (a) To have an in-house laundry which is situated in the premises: Such a decision will require huge investments in equipment, space and technical skills. An in-house laundry is feasible when the hotel is over 300 rooms with large volumes every day of linen and uniforms to process. Another reason can be lack of a quality laundry in the city to outsource work.
- (b) A commercial laundry in the city which is reliable and professional to handle the volumes of linen and uniform: The critical issue in such a decision is the ability of the laundry to meet daily replacements of fresh linen and uniform to meet operational needs. A commercial laundry is run by a person qualified in laundry management. It becomes an outsourced service with strict contractual obligations.

## ORGANISATION STRUCTURE WITH JOB DESCRIPTIONS

The laundry department reports to the executive housekeeper administratively. For technical purposes it is headed by a laundry manager supported by specialist supervisors. The department has the following specialisations:

## Sorting, Marking, Packing Section

This is where guest garments are received and sorted by laundry treatments required:

- (1) Dry cleaning and washing;
- (2) Degree of soil;
- (3) Type of fabric; and
- (4) Urgency of delivery.

They are labelled for identification before laundering and later packed and delivered to guest rooms.

## Washing and Dry Cleaning Section

This is the section that washes linen, uniforms and guest garments.

## Tumbler Operation Section

This is where linen and clothes are dried. A machine is dedicated to towel-like material to retain their fluffiness. Most washing machines nowadays have drying cycles too.

## Ironing Section

This is the area where linen and clothes are ironed. Specialised presses are used for different types of clothes, such as:

Figure 26.2 gives the organisation chart required to run these services.

<!-- image -->

## Hot-Head Press

This is where two flat surfaces press the garments. The top has a hot metal surface while the bottom is padded to absorb the heat and press.

## Steam Press

It adopts the same principle as the hot head press except that the top surface is perforated through which steam passes out.

## Shirt Press

These are special presses to give men's shirts their proper contours and creases-especially sleeves, shoulders and collars.

## Hand Press

They are like domestic presses used for light garments. Laundries can have heavy duty presses for stubborn creases and materials.

## Flat Irons or Calendar Machines

They are used for sheets, pillow cases and towels. A flat iron consists of cylindrical padded rollers through which steam is passed and linen pieces are roll ironed.

## Spotting Section

This area specialises in removing spots and stains.

## Valet Service Area

In this area, valets attend to phones from guest rooms to collect their laundry.

## INTRODUCTION

The relationship between housekeeping and laundry is very significant for the smooth functioning of housekeeping services. The laundry supplies housekeeping with clean linen and uniform on a daily basis. It also processes guest laundry ensuring guest satisfaction. It is therefore important for housekeeping personnel to know something of the operations of the laundry to fully understand its importance and contribution. A good laundry fulfils certain basic requirements:

- 1. It meets on time the operational requirements of linen and uniforms.
- 2. It ensures that white linen and uniform are indeed kept white.
- 3. It secures the laundry premises from pilferage.
- 4. Correct detergents are used for different materials.
- 5. Guest laundry is properly marked and counted.
- 6. Equipment are loaded as per manufacturers instructions.
- 7. Stains and damages are brought to the notice of the housekeeper before the laundry cycle commences.
- 8. Equipment has a preventive maintenance plan to ensure smooth delivery.
- 9. Staff hired is qualified and properly trained.
- 10. There is full accountability of in-house linen and uniforms received and issued.

Guest Laundry Cycle

## GUEST LAUNDRY PROCEDURE

Let us take each step at a time in the process above:

## Guest Calls

The guest laundry process is initiated by a resident guest who desires to have his/her clothes washed, dry cleaned or pressed:

- 1. The guest chooses the appropriate laundry list (Fig. 27.2) (one is for washing and the other for dry cleaning and pressing).
- 2. S/he fills the column 'Guest Count' mentioning the number of each item and the expected cost of each set of items.
- 3. S/he puts the soiled garments and laundry list in a laundry bag found in the wardrobe of the room.
- 4. S/he calls for valet service by dialling the extension number found in the house service directory.

## The Laundry Desk Attendant

- 1. R eceives the call and notes:
- the name
- room number
- 2. He alerts the valet who collects and delivers laundry to guest rooms.

<!-- image -->

## Valet

A valet is a general runner who collects and returns guest laundry from the rooms.

- 1. The valet proceeds to the guest room.
- 2. He announces himself when knocking the door.
- 3. He tallies the guest count with his own physical count and notes the numbers in the column 'House Count'.
- 4. He alerts the guest for any discrepancies.
- 5. He makes sure that the laundry list has the following:
- Guest's name
- Room number
- Date
- Urgency of service by when the clothes are required
- Guest's signature

## Sorter/Marker

- 1. The valet deposits the laundry bag with the sorter/marker.
- 2. The sorter/marker checks the clothes for spots and stains. He does not want those spots and stains to spread or become permanent in the laundering process. He alerts the guest for any serious stains or damages.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 3. Stained clothes are tagged with the room number and sent to the spotter.
- 4. He tags the other garments with indelible marking ink to identify them in future processes.
- 5. Sends garments for washing, dry cleaning or pressing.

Modern hotels have automatic stamping machines to identify clothes.

## Spotter

The spotter is a specialist who removes spots and stains.

- 1. The spotter receives stained clothes from the sorter/marker.
- 2. The spotter will sort the garment by its texture and colour.
- 3. He treats the stain by its type and the degree of damage.
- 4. He returns the garments once treated to the Washerman/ Dry Cleaner or Pressman for their necessary attention.

## Washerman or Dry Cleaner

- 1. He sorts the garments by types and puts them in separate batches.
- 2. He will load the washing machine or dry cleaning machine for washing or dry cleaning and follow procedures. While the washerman uses water as the medium of cleaning, the dry cleaner uses a dry cleaning solvent.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 3. Washed garments require water twice their weight.
- 4. The water is squeezed out in hydro-extractors.
- 5. The clothes are removed when the cloth has approximately 25% water left. This is recommended for effective ironing.

## Pressman

After washing or dry cleaning, the garments go for pressing. Guest laundry meant for pressing only is sent directly to the pressman by the sorter/marker. There are various presses for guest garments such as:

- Hot-head press
- Steam press
- Shirt press
- Suit press
- Hand press

## Packers

<!-- image -->

Once the garments are pressed, they are sent in batches to the packer.

- 1. He tallies the garment labels with their respective laundry lists.
- 2. He then proceeds to either pack them or hang them on hangers as requested by the guest.

## Valet

- 1. The valet receives the packed garments with the original laundry list stapled onto the package.
- 2. The valet proceeds to the desk attendant to raise an invoice.

## Desk Attendant

- 1. He checks the package and contents with the laundry list.
- 2. He creates an invoice which is often a tear away slip at the end of the laundry list.

## Delivery to Guest

- 1. The valet proceeds to the guest room to deliver the laundry to the guest.
- 2. He announces himself when knocking the door.
- 3. He receives the guest's signature on the invoice. Laundry bills are not paid in cash.
- 4. He hands over the signed invoice to the front office cashier to post in the guest's folio.

## HOUSE LINEN AND UNIFORM CYCLE

## Linen/Uniform Room

The linen/uniform room has specific times to exchange linen and uniforms. Soiled ones are sorted by their respective types and sent to the laundry.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Floor Linen

The floor linen is sent either directly by chutes from floor pantries or in linen hampers by floor personnel at specific times. The linen is counted at the laundry floor by both the floor representative and laundry representative.

<!-- image -->

## Washing and Dry Cleaning

The piles of linen and uniform are sorted by the washerman and dry cleaner and placed in batches matching the fabric texture and colour.

## Hydro-extractor/Tumbler

After  washing,  the  fabrics  are  sent  to  reduce  the  water  content  to approximately 25% moisture through these machines, for effective ironing. Tumblers are used for items like towel or similar material where the drying process aerates the fibres and brings about a fluff.

<!-- image -->

## Presses

After the drying process, flat linen like bed sheets, pillow cases, tablecloths, napkins, etc. are sent to the flat iron that suitably irons large flat linen. Other items especially uniforms are sent to other presses already mentioned in the guest laundry process. The press men and women fold the uniforms and linen and assemble them in neat stacks in trolleys for delivery to the linen/uniform room/s.

## Stain Removal

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## INTRODUCTION

Stains are one of the greatest challenges to a housekeeper and laundry manager. Stains are inevitable in any operations. A housekeeper's expertise is judged by her ability to remove various stains. The process of removing stains is called 'spotting'.

## EQUIPMENT USED IN SPOTTING

Good spotting equipment (see picture alongside) can be obtained at a moderate outlay and will repay its cost in speedy spotting and excellent workmanship. Some essential accessories are:

## Steam Gun

The steam gun is a device that sprays steam locally on stains. It is supported by a portable steamer (see picture on right) . The steam gun has simplified the spotter's task and removes most food stains, especially those of a sugary nature. The steam gun avoids the use of chemicals.

<!-- image -->

## Brushes

Brushes play an important part in spotting. Brushes with white bristles are ideal for use on white fabric. Brushes for woollens should be long-about 1 1/2 inch. Silk spotting brushes are usually smaller about 1 1/4 inches. The bristles are longer so as to avoid chafing the fabrics. All brushes must have a face which is perfectly flat as uneven bristles give a rough surface and damage the fabric. Brushes should be well rinsed and left for drying each evening.

## Chamois

Chamois (soft leather from sheep or goats) is the best for absorbing excess water. It should be large and thick. It should be rinsed in clean water and spread to dry. This will lengthen the life of the leather and prevent it from going old. Always use the chamois with a tamping action.

## Absorbent Pads

Absorbent pads are used under stains which are being spotted, to soak up chemicals and solvents and the dissolved matter which they carry out, and so prevent the spreading of the stain.

## Drying Cabinet

A drying cabinet is ideal to dry garments after spotting operations.

## Magnifying Glass

A magnifying glass is most useful in spotting stains which are difficult to recognize with the naked eye.

## CLASSIFICATION OF STAINS

Stains fall under three categories:

## Absorbed Stains

Absorbed stains are caused by items which are thin in consistency and penetrate the fabric easily. Such stains are soft and pliable, except where fair amounts of sugar and syrups are present resulting in stiffening. Examples of this type of stains are beverages of all types (beer, tea, coffee, cola, etc.) and medicines such as cough mixtures.

## Built-up Stains

Built-up stains are caused by liquids which fail to penetrate the fabric and lie on the fabric surface. Stains of this nature are diverse such as paint, distemper, tar, sealing wax, lacquers, glues and resinous compounds.

## Compound Stains

Compound stains are a combination of the previous two types as they both penetrate the fabric and leave a built-up residue on the surface of the material. Such stains are found to be of medium stiffness and never quite hard or soft and pliable. Blood stains are a good example of this type of stain.

## HOW TO IDENTIFY STAINS

Sight identifies the stain and therefore the method of spotting to be employed.

Odour is a way to identify perfumes, disinfectants, medicines and chemicals.

<!-- image -->

Colour like light yellow indicates a medicinal stain while reddish orange shows a rust stain. Blue or black indicate ink stains while brown shows oil stains. Black is for tar, inks, paints and heavy red oil; and green for inks, paints or dye stuff.

Feel helps to establish the origin of stains. Stiffness denotes the presence of oxidised oils, varnish, sugars and starches. Sugar and starch turn white when subjected to the treatment of scratching the stain.

Location helps to pinpoint the cause of the trouble. Perfume stains will usually be located on lapis of garments and in some cases under arms. Sweat stains can be found in under arms and collars.

## STAIN-REMOVAL AGENTS

Stains are removed by a solvent. When choosing a solvent, one has to take into account three factors: (1) The agent that caused the stain; (2) the material on which the stain appears; and (3) compound stains like machine oil and metal. Incorrect use of solvent can damage the material on which the stain appears. There are several alternatives for different types of stains, some of which are discussed below.

## Absorbents

Absorbents 'soak up' stains, especially grease stains. Some good examples are baking soda, corn starch, cornmeal (usually considered the best for lighter colours), white talcum powder, and fuller's earth (best for use on darker colours, available at pharmacies and garden supply stores). Absorbents are used on light or new stains; they will damage neither fabrics nor other surfaces and they are easy to use.

## Acids

These are harmful to skin and breathing. They will need protective gear when handling them. The acids will need dilution before administering them to reduce toxicity. They are good to remove metal stains and rust. Examples of such acids are oxalic acid, boric acid and acetic acid. Oxalic acid is effective in treating ink and rust stains. Oxalic acid crystals may also be specially ordered for this purpose. Crystals must be dissolved in water. Liquid oxalic acid should be pre-tested on a hidden corner before using it on the stain. Moisten the stained area with the solution. Allow to dry, then reapply, keeping the area moist until the stain is removed. Be sure all traces of the solution are rinsed out. Oxalic acid is poisonous and contact with the skin and eyes, is harmful. Wear rubber gloves and other protective clothing when working with it.

A 10% solution of acetic acid can be purchased generically at pharmacies. (White vinegar is 5% acetic acid and can be used as a substitute for the stronger solution.) It is a clear fluid that can be used to remove stains on silk and wool. It must be diluted with 2 parts water for use on cotton and linen (a pre-test is recommended). It should not be used on acetate. If acetic acid causes a colour change, it is recommended to sponge the affected area with ammonia.

## Alkalis

These are good for removing organic stains like vegetables, tea and coffee. Examples are soda and borax. More potent alkalis are sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide used for drain pipes and gutters where grease accumulates.

## Lacquer Solvents

A good example of this is acetone, which removes household cement, nail polish, certain glues and grease. Acetone is a colourless liquid that smells like peppermint. Although it will not damage either natural fibres or most synthetics, it should be pretested to make sure that dyed fabrics will not be harmed. It should not be used on fabrics containing acetate. Use only pure acetone on stains.

## Oxidising Solvents

Some good examples under this category are bleach and lemon juice. Bleaching is done to remove colour on white fabrics. Popular bleaches are hydrogen peroxide, chlorine bleach and sodium perborate. Chlorine bleach can be used as a disinfectant and stain remover. Chlorine is commonly used to bleach white cotton; linen, and synthetic fabrics. Chlorine bleach is potent and can weaken fibres. Even cotton and linen will be weakened, if allowed to soak in a bleach solution for too long. Chlorine bleach should not be used on silk, wool, or fabrics exposed to sunlight (curtains, for example). It is recommended to always pretest bleach on a hidden area and rinse all bleached items thoroughly as a precaution to damaging fabric. Chlorine bleach is poisonous. It causes burns and irritation, if it comes in contact with the skin or eyes. Read all warnings on the label. Never mix chlorine bleach with other cleaning substances, especially ammonia, as this will release chloramine, a highly toxic substance. Sodium perborate is sold in crystal form. It is safe for all fabrics and surfaces, although, once again, pretesting is recommended to assure that the fabric is colourfast. This oxygen-type bleach is slower-acting than hydrogen peroxide. When using this bleach, be sure to rinse treated articles thoroughly. Hydrogen peroxide at 3% solution is a good bleach, safe for most surfaces and all fibres (though dyed fabrics should be pretested for colourfastness).

## Dry-Cleaning Solvents

Dry-cleaning solvents are chemicals, often derived from petroleum or benzene, used to remove dirt and stains from clothing. These are powerful chemicals, and some have been removed from the market due to their effects on humans and the environment.

Others, such as tetrachloroethylene (or perchloroethylene, also known as PERC) are now used mostly by commercial dry cleaners or in automotive or hobby-related cleaners. Some products that contained these solvents have been retired or reformulated.

A dry-cleaning solvent should be used and stored carefully. Their fumes are toxic and should not be inhaled. Not all spot removers/dry-cleaning solvents can be used on all surfaces, nor will all products remove all stains, so be sure to read the labels before using. These solvents are good at dissolving stains of grease, oil, paint, ballpoint ink, lipstick, etc.

## Other Solvents

Sodium Thiosulphate is also known as photographic 'hypo' or fixer. Although considered safe for all fibres and harmless to dyes, it should be tested on an inconspicuous area of fabric before use. It must be handled carefully, as sodium thiosulphate can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, lungs and digestive tract. Turpentine is commonly used as a thinner for oil-based paints. It is effective on paint and grease stains, but it must be used carefully. Turpentine is flammable and poisonous and, therefore, the user must observe all label precautions. White Vinegar is used for stain removal. Cider and wine vinegar have colour that can leave a stain. Vinegar should be diluted before use on cotton or linen. Vinegar is safe for all other colourfast fibres but can change the colour of some dyes. It

is recommended to always test its effects on an inconspicuous area first. If a dye changes colour, rinse the affected area with water and add a few drops of ammonia. Rinse thoroughly with water again. Glycerine is used in the preparation of the wet spotter, which is used to remove many kinds of stains. Amyl Acetate (banana oil) is used in stain removal. It is safe for use on fibres that could be damaged by acetone, but it should not be allowed to come in contact with plastics or furniture finishes. Amyl acetate is poisonous and flammable. Avoid contact with the skin and inhaling the vapours.

Ammonia is used for stain removal. Because ammonia affects some dyes, it is recommended to pre-test on a hidden corner of the stained article. To restore colour changed by ammonia, rinse the affected area with water and apply a few drops of white vinegar. Rinse with clear water again. Ammonia damages silk and wool. If it has to be used for these fibres, dilute ammonia with an equal amount of water and use as sparingly as possible. Ammonia is poisonous. Avoid inhaling its fumes. It will cause burns or irritation, if it comes in contact with the skin or eyes. Observe all label precautions. Never mix ammonia with chlorine bleach, as this will release chloramine, a highly toxic substance. Alcohol: The common isopropyl alcohol (70%) is sufficient for most stain-removal jobs that call for alcohol, although the stronger denatured alcohol (90%) can also be used. Alcohol with added colour or fragrance should not be used. Alcohol will fade some dyes, therefore, a pre-test is recommended. Alcohol will damage acetate, tri-acetate, modacrylic, and acrylic fibres. Alcohol is poisonous and flammable. All label precautions must be observed.

Table 28.1 gives a good idea of how to treat different types of stains.

## OTHER HOUSEKEEPING KNOWLEDGE

## INTRODUCTION

It is important for a professional housekeeper to have some basic knowledge of textiles as she is responsible for their selection and upkeep. She purchases linen in volumes that are used in guest rooms, restaurants, banquets, spa, swimming pool, etc. Her next concern is uniforms of various types. Some are rugged like the dungarees of gardeners, kitchen stewarding utility workers and engineering mechanics, while others are dainty for receptionists, restaurant hostesses, waitresses, etc. Without some knowledge of textiles, the housekeeper is handicapped when purchasing and maintaining them. She will have to rely on whatever the manufacturers tell her.

First let us understand some fundamental terms. The words 'fabric' and 'cloth' are used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as synonymous to 'textile'. However, the housekeeper must know their subtle differences. 'Textile' refers to any material made of interlacing fibres. 'Fabric' refers to any material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, crocheting, or bonding (all explained later) that may be used in production of further goods (garments, etc.). Cloth may be used synonymously with fabric, but often refers to a finished piece of fabric used for a specific purpose (e.g. tablecloth). In order to understand textiles, we have to know what makes it. A textile is made up of strands of fibres. Fibres are the raw materials for all textiles. Fibres come from nature through animal, plant and mineral strands. Fibres are collected, sorted and then twisted to form a yarn. Yarns are interlaced (woven) together to form a textile. Most natural fibres used for textile production measure ½ to 8 inches. Such short fibres are called staple fibres . Modern technology has developed synthetic fibres that are produced in continuous lengths and are called filaments . There are two kinds of fibres: natural fibres and man-made fibres (from natural sources).

## NATURAL FIBRES

Natural fibres include animal, plant, and mineral fibres.

## Textiles

## Animal Fibres

Animal fibres would include the following:

Wool which is derived from sheep and goat is of two qualities: (1) Worsted yarns which have long finer fibres which have been combed to be parallel. Worsted yarns are commonly used for warm clothing. All finer quality of fabrics is made of worsted yarns; and (2) Woollen yarns are bulkier produced from carded, non-parallel fibre. Woollen yarns have small fibres. Woollen yarns are used for making carpets, blankets and felts. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing.

The wool is sheared from sheep, sorted, washed and dried; oil is applied and the fibres are combed so that they lie parallel to each other. From here the yarns are spun. Wool provides warm,

comfortable fabrics for dresses, suits and cardigans. Some members of the camel and goat family also produce wool. The pashmina wool of the Afghanistan goat is the rarest fibre of them producing the finest shawls, carpets and rugs. Other animal textiles are made from hair or fur such as alpaca wool, vicuña wool, llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings. Angora refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the Angora rabbit. Cashmere, the hair of the Indian Cashmere goat, and mohair, the hair of the North African Angora goat, are types of wool known for their softness.

Silk is derived from caterpillars. These worms form a cocoon or nest around themselves with the saliva from their mouths. They lie in the cocoon and change into butterflies, break their cocoon, lay their eggs on leaves and die. Silk is divided into two kinds-cultivated silk and wild or Tussar silk. Cultivated silk is derived when the butterflies are killed inside the cocoon and after de-gunning the cocoon, the yarns are stretched out. This is the only fibre in nature which comes in the yarn form with 200 metres to 400 metres in length. The wild silk is derived from broken cocoons and yarn is 2' to 21' long. All finer qualities of fabric are produced from the cultivated silk and the thicker ones from wild silk.

## Plant Fibres

Plants provide more textile fibres than do animals or minerals. In fact, one plant, cotton, accounts for 95% fibres of the natural fibres in the United States. Cotton fibres produce soft, absorbent fabrics that are widely used for clothing, sheets and towels. Flax is a plant with blue flowers grown for its stem the fibres of which are made into linen. The seeds of the Flax plant are used to produce linseed oil. Plant fibres may be categorised as follows:

- 1. Seed fibres, e.g. cotton
- 2. Stem fibres, e.g. flax, jute, seaweed and ramie (China grass)
- 3. Fruit fibres, e.g. coconut (coir), pineapple (Pina), banana and cacti.

## Cotton

It is derived from plants which are 3 to 5 feet tall. The flowers of cotton are in pods which are cracked and opened. The cotton fibres are removed and further cleaned by removing the seeds. These fibres

## Textiles

are combed to lie parallel to each other and from these the yarns are spun. Cotton fibres produce absorbent fabrics that are widely used for clothing, sheets, and towels. As earlier mentioned all long fibres make finer and thinner yarns and hence the quality of the fabric depends on the quality of fibres used in yarns. The strength and beauty of linen produced from flax fibres have made it a popular fabric for fine table cloths, napkins and handkerchiefs.

Since cotton is a major textile used in hotel operations, it is beneficial to understand the preparation process of cotton to yarn.

Opening and Cleaning Raw cotton comes to cotton mills in 500 pound (125 kg) bales. The cotton is put through an opener machine to fluff it and separate any residual cotton seeds. It is then beaten through a picker machine to beat the cotton and dislodge the seeds. It is sieved using a fan to reach a fluffy consistency.

<!-- image -->

Carding The cotton from the picking machine comes out in sheets or 'laps' and fed into a caring machine consisting of rollers with fine teeth. The cotton leaves the carding machine in large ropes of fibre.

Note: In  a  wider  sense,  carding  can  refer  to  these  four  processes: willowing-loosening the fibres; lapping-removing the dust to create a flat sheet or lap of cotton; carding-combing the tangled lap into a thick rope of 1/2 inch in diameter, a sliver; and drawing-where a drawing frame combines 4 slivers into one-repeated for increased quality.

<!-- image -->

Combing: It is optional, but is used to remove the shorter fibres, creating a stronger yarn.

Drawing: It is a process where fibres are straightened, twisted and made into consistent thickness the width of a pencil. These ropes are called 'slivers'. The slivers are later separated into finer yarns called 'rovings'. The rovings feed into looms to make fabric.

Weaving At this point, the 'rovings' are fed into looms to weave them into fabric. The three primary movements of a loom are shedding, picking, and beating-up.

- (a) Shedding: It is the operation of dividing the warp into two lines, so that the shuttle can pass between these lines. There are  two  general  kinds  of  sheds-'open' and 'closed'. In the open shed, the warp threads are moved when the pattern requires it from one line to the other. In the closed shed, the warp threads are all placed level in one line after each pick.
- (b) Picking: The operation of projecting the shuttle from side to side of the loom through the division in the warp threads. This is done by the overpick or underpick motions. The overpick is suitable for quick-running looms, whereas the underpick is best-suited for heavy or slow looms.

<!-- image -->

- (c) Beating-up: The third primary movement of the loom when making cloth, and is the action of the reed as it drives each pick of weft to the fell of the cloth.

## Production Methods

Weaving is a textile production method which involves interlacing a set of longer threads (called the warp) with a set of crossing threads (called the weft). This is done on a frame or machine known as a loom, which are of various types. Some weaving is still done by hand, but the vast majority is mechanised.

Knitting and crocheting involve interlacing loops of yarn, which are formed either on a knitting needle or on a crochet hook, together in a line. The two processes are different in that knitting has several active loops at one time, on the knitting needle waiting to interlock with another loop, while crocheting never has more than one active loop on the needle.

Spread tow is a production method where the yarn are spread into thin tapes, and then the tapes are woven as warp and weft. This method is mostly used for composite materials; Spread Tow Fabrics can be made in carbon, aramid, etc.

Braiding or plaiting involves twisting threads together into cloth. Knotting involves tying threads together and is used in making macramé.

Lace is  made  by  interlocking  threads  together  independently,  using  a  backing  and  any  of  the methods described above, to create a fine fabric with open holes in the work. Lace can be made by either hand or machine.

Carpets, rugs, velvet, velour, and velveteen are made by interlacing a secondary yarn through woven cloth, creating a tufted layer known as a nap or pile.

Felting involves pressing a mat of fibres together, and working them together until they become tangled. A liquid, such as soapy water, is usually added to lubricate the fibres, and to open up the microscopic scales on strands of wool.

Non-woven textiles are manufactured by the bonding of fibres to make fabric. Bonding may be thermal or mechanical, or adhesives can be used.

## Finishing processing of textiles

The raw grey woven cotton fabric from the loom contains impurities that require further treatment in order to develop its full textile potential and the added value. The fabric will need one or more finishing processes given below:

## Desizing

The cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, oxidised or use enzymes to break down the impurities of the cloth as required. This process makes the fabric more absorbent which is what cotton fabric are noted for.

## Scouring

Scouring, is a chemical washing process in closed iron vessels called 'kiers', to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from fabrics. The fabric is boiled under pressure (as presence of oxygen degrades the cellulose in the fabric) in an alkali (sodium hydroxide) which forms soap with free fatty acids. At this stage, even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish. The next process, i.e. bleaching, is required.

## Bleaching

Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural colouration and remaining impurities from the cotton. The level of bleaching is based on the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as diluted sodium hypochlorite or diluted hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable. For white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.

## Mercerising

Mercerising is the process of adding lustre and strength to the fabric. The fabric is treated with caustic soda solution that swells the fibres. Cotton is mercerised under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released otherwise the fabric will shrink. Mercerising can take place directly on grey cloth, or after bleaching.

## Non-chemical finishing treatment

Many other chemical treatments may be applied to cotton fabrics to produce low flammability, crease resist and other special effects but four important non-chemical finishing treatments are:

## (a) Singeing

Singeing is designed to burn off the surface fibres from the fabric to produce smoothness. The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibres, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames.

## (b) Raising

Raising is a process where sharp teeth lifts the surface fibres giving fluffiness, softness and warmth, as in flannelette.

## (c) Calendering

Calendering is the third important mechanical process, in which the fabric is passed between heated rollers to generate smooth, polished or embossed effects depending on roller surface properties and speeds.

## (d) Shrinking (Sanforising)

Mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforising) is done, whereby the fabric is forced to shrink so that there is no residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering.

## (e) Dyeing

Cotton is an absorbent fibre which responds readily to colouration. The dyeing process is carried out with an anionic direct dye by completely immersing the fabric (or yarn) in an aqueous dyebath according to a prescribed procedure. Other dyes and reactives are used to improve colour fastness during washing, rubbing and light. These require more complex processes thus are more expensive.

## (f) Printing

Printing is the application of colour and pattern using paste or ink to the surface of a fabric. It may be considered as localised dyeing. Printing designs on to already dyed fabric is also possible.

## Jute

These plants are very much like bamboo but of thinner quality. These are cut and collected, put into water to rot, then the green layer is removed and the fibres are collected and spun into yarns.

<!-- image -->

Fibres of the jute plant can be woven into burlap. They are used to make sack and backing for rugs and carpets, etc.

## Coconut fibres

These are well known as husk of the coconut and also called coir. The coconut is steeped in water and these fibres are removed and spun into yarns. These are used for door mats and ropes etc.

## Mineral Fibres

Asbestos is the only real mineral fibre used for textiles. It is derived from rocks and these fibres are mixed with other textile fibres and made into yarn. These are used for firemen's garments and to form fire-retardant hoses as they are poor conductors of heat though they burn at extremely high temperatures.

Glass, Aluminium, Gold and Silver are melted and strung out into fine strands from which fabrics like fibre glass ideal for flame resistant fabrics and aluminium, gold and silver for decorative yarns for bedspreads, evening gowns and tablecloths.

## Synthetic or Man-made Fibres

Most manufactured fibres are made from wood pulp, cotton linters (leftover cotton from the cotton seed) or petrochemicals derived from crude oil and natural gas. The fibres made from wood pulp and linters are rayon, acetate and tri-acetate.

- Rayon and acetate are widely used for clothing, draperies and upholstery. Rayon is an absorbent fabric and therefore dyes easily.
- Fabrics of acetate resist shrinking and stretching.
- Tri-acetate  has  the  qualities  of  acetate  as  also  resists  wrinkling, especially useful for sportswear.

The chief fibres from petrochemicals include nylon, polyester, acrylic and olefin.

- Nylon has many useful qualities: it launders well; wears well; exceptionally  strong;  and  versatile  for  clothes,  carpets  and upholstery.
- Polyester resists wrinkling and ideal for clothes that are required such for long use.

- Acrylic is heavier and ideal for blankets and carpets.
- Olefin cleans and dries easily and therefore the perfect material for carpets.

## INTRODUCTION

We have already learnt that one of the principle roles of housekeeping is the aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. Aesthetics is provided by interior design and horticulture with flower arrangements. Large hotels have a dedicated horticultural team to beautify the external areas of a property, duly supported by a florist responsible for all the flower arrangements in the house. They report to the Executive Housekeeper. Smaller properties depend on the housekeeper to fill in this function assisted by a few gardeners to execute the role. It is therefore important for any housekeeping professional to have some basic knowledge of horticulture and floral art.

## HORTICULTURE

The word horticulture comes from the Latin word hortus , which means garden. Horticulture is a branch of agriculture that specialises in fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental shrubs and trees. While the definition encompasses a wide range of activities, a hotel is interested in the use of plants in landscaping and flower arrangements. Therefore, horticulture is the art and science of gardening. While flowers and plants are grown in gardens, they are nurtured as saplings in greenhouses and nurseries. A greenhouse maintains exotic plants at controlled climatic conditions while nurseries are where saplings are grown to maturity before they are re-planted in the garden. Horticulture is generally divided into four main specialties:

- 1. Pomology is the cultivation of shrubs, trees and vines for fruits.
- 2. Olericulture deals with vegetable plants.
- 3. Floriculture is the production and use of flowers and foliage plants.
- 4. Ornamental horticulture is concerned with shrubs, lawns and ornamental trees in landscapes.

In this chapter, we will be concerned with landscaping and floral art.

## LANDSCAPING

Landscaping is the science of designing and developing land for human enjoyment. The external areas of a hotel represent the quality of the hotel and its management. It is the first evidence to a visitor before s/he even steps inside a hotel. It promotes the hotel and creates an ambience of peace and tranquility. This visual impact is created by gardens and the adornments that enhance it. The landscape is done by a landscape architect at the inception of the hotel. They study the climatic conditions, water supply, and type of vegetation, soil composition and the slope of the land. They preserve attractive views especially of city landmarks. They then proceed to dig the land and bring

it into shape. They determine the shrubbery and flowers and hand the continued responsibility to the hotel's horticulturist or housekeeper.

The horticulture  department  of  the  hotel  consists  of  a horticulturist,  head  gardener and gardeners. The number of gardeners will depend on the acreage. Landscapes include private beaches; hill slopes; cascades; and waterways. Complex landscapes will require different expertise and an additional number of gardeners to maintain them.

## Horticultural Facilities & Equipment

## Water Supply

A landscape will have a water supply system .  This is very important to gardens. Flowers and shrubs need water for survival. Water heads have to be further distributed to the far corners of the garden by hoses and sprinkler systems. The role of water is magnified when the landscape has waterways, waterfalls and islands requiring large volumes of water.

## Nursery

Another major feature is a nursery for saplings. It is a dedicated portion of land away from the guest view, where all the preliminary preparation of plants is done. This includes growing them from seed to sapling ready for transplanting into flower beds. The nursery is also the place where flowerpots are prepared for internal decoration. Those flowers that are suitable for indoor use are nurtured here before they are transported indoors. They would have to be recycled periodically for sunlight and are brought to the nursery.

## Greenhouse

The next major feature is a greenhouse . This feature is optional. Superior hotels like to have an edge over others by displaying exotic flowers. They procure seeds and saplings from all parts of  the  world.  Some  hotels  may  have  their  flowers  as  their signature. The  greenhouses  maintain  flowers  in  controlled climatic conditions.

## Garden Shed

Another essential construction for a horticultural  operation  is the garden shed . The shed is where all the small gardening tools are stored. Large landscapes will have large numbers of tools for gardeners to complete their work. The shed could also be where the  manure of the gardens is stored. Another alternative is the nursery.

## GARDENING TOOLS

The horticultural team has an assortment of gardening tools to help them accomplish their work. These include:

- 1. Shovels for digging up large amount of soil.
- 2. Trowels for  shallow  digging  especially  to  transplant saplings.
- 3. Wheel barrows to transport soil and other items.
- 4. Hoe for digging flower beds.
- 5. Leaf blowers for blowing aside unwanted dead leaves that scatter the lawns.
- 6. Lawn mowers to cut grass into a lawn.
- 7. Pitch fork for picking dead leaves.
- 8. Rake for collecting leaves and soil.
- 9. Shears for cutting shrubbery.
- 10. Watering can needed to water indoor plants and select flower beds.
- 11. Hoses to extend water to areas not reached by the main supply.
- 12. Tillers to prepare the flower beds for planting.
- 13. Trimmers to trim branches;
- 14. Flowerpots for indoor and outdoor potted plants.
- 15. Pruners to crop flowers and branches.
- 16. Manure to fertilise the soil.

## TYPES OF GARDENS

There are two types of gardens that a housekeeper is involved with: (a) outdoor gardens and (b) indoor gardens.

Outdoor gardens: There  are  two  types  that  fall  in  this  category  (a)  ornamental  gardens  and (b) food gardens. The housekeeper with her horticulture team is concerned with ornamental gardens which in itself has various categories:

- 1. Potted gardens: These are gardens where flowers like Begonias, Geraniums, Fuchsias and Petunias are grown in flowerpots. Each type of flower requires its own care. Pots come in a  wide range of materials, sizes, shapes and prices bought from nurseries and gardening shops.
- 2. Formal flower gardens: These consist of flower beds dug in the ground and laid out in patterns to give a visually attractive look. Generally, the flower beds have straight or rounded edges. The beds will have similar flowers that rise to a common height and shape. These need the constant care of gardeners to keep them neat and trim.

- 3. Informal flower gardens: These have different types of flowers of irregular heights in one bed. They need less caring and give a multi-cultured look.
- 4. Rock gardens: These gardens have flowers or shrubbery in and around a rock arrangement called a rockery. The garden may centre their flower planting around rocks already existing in the landscape or those rockeries specially created.
- 5. Water gardens: These are gardens where water is the theme. Some hotels may inherit ponds and lakes. Flower arrangements can be done around these natural assets. Other properties may create artificial ponds which are expensive. Other aspects of water gardens are waterways, fountains and waterfalls. Some of these water features can have plants that grow in water like water lilies. Naturally such gardens must be assured of plenty of water and have such systems for recycling the water; filtration; and care to prevent the growth of moss and lichens. Such gardens are expensive.
- 6. Wild flower gardens: These are gardens that take advantage of abundant local flora. Gardeners acquire them from the countryside and re-plant them in the hotel garden. There are states that pride themselves with their flora. The hotel can take advantage of this.

## Indoor Gardens

Indoor Gardens are created with potted plants. The size of the pot determines how large the plant will grow. There are special plants for indoor purposes that require little sunlight and water. Most of them are  leafy  shrubs  rather  than  flowers.  Ideally  the  plant  can  be  next to  windows or under atriums. However, this is not essential. Some plants grow on artificial light from incandescent or fluorescent lamps. Popular indoor plants are the wax begonia; Boston fern; cacti; corn plant; common coleus; split leaved philodendron; English ivy; India rubber plant; and the African violet. To a housekeeper, indoor plants may be found in lobbies; suites; foyers; atrium lounges; executive offices; business lounge; meeting rooms; etc. Indoor plants need a degree of humidity. This can be achieved by placing pots on trays with water and pebbles, sand or charcoal. The moisture evaporates and makes the immediate surroundings humid. Misters are hand-held equipment that squirts mist onto plants. Misters are used to prevent water from spreading to other areas of the room. This must be done once daily at least.

Most indoor plants can be bought readymade or nurtured in the nursery or greenhouse before placing them indoors. Here are some tips to maintain them:

- Keep them in a fairly cool place away from direct sunlight.
- Their soil should be moist.
- They need special fertilisers but care must be taken not to over feed them.
- Keep them aside from outdoor plants to ensure that they do not get disease or pests.
- Water them when the soil just below the surface is dry, using tepid water and not cold or hot water. The best time to water them is in the morning.

- Wash the plants every two weeks to flush out dirt and any small pests that may have lodged on them. The plants can be washed in floor pantries or in the greenhouse. Alternatively, wipe the plants with a wet cloth or sponge on both sides.
- Prune the dead leaves and flowers to improve the appearance and growth of plants.
- Change pots sometimes. Repotting can be achieved by inverting the old pot and let the plant with the soil slide into the hand. Place drainage material like pebbles or broken chips of clay pots, in the new container. The material needs to be only 1 inch thick for pots with a hole at the bottom. Put fresh soil in the pot and insert the old plant with soil into the pot finishing the pot with fresh soil.
- Many indoor plants can be easily propagated by taking cuttings from them. Most cuttings consist of stems or leaves. The cuttings are placed in water to develop roots. The rooted cuttings are then planted in soil and developed into complete new plants.

## Safety in Housekeeping

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

To  help  readers  to  be  aware  of  the  occupational  hazards  in safety.

## OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD

Housekeeping in a hotel is a physically demanding job. Personnel are on their feet for a full shift of 8 hours performing various tasks that are demanding on the body. The main concerns arise out of physical workload; excessive bodily motions; and awkward positions that put a strain on the back, limbs, shoulders and neck. In a typical day, they would be:

- Walking: Consider the miles public area personnel cover when cleaning the length and breadth of a hotel. The gardeners walk long distances to care for landscapes and gardens.
- Standing: All housekeeping personnel are on their feet in a full shift.
- Stooping: Room attendants will need to stoop to pick garbage from floors; to clean bathtubs and water closets; and to get linen from bottom shelves of maid carts; etc.
- Squatting: Gardeners will need to squat for long hours while preparing flower beds, planting seeds; and preparing flower pots for indoor decoration.
- Kneeling: Room attendants would kneel while cleaning bathroom floors. Public area staff would do the same to clean stubborn stains from floors and staircases.
- Stretching: Linen keepers will stretch to get linen and uniforms from higher shelves. Room attendants would stretch to clean the upper reaches of bathroom tiles and mirrors.
- Reaching: All housekeeping personnel reach for something or the other. Room attendants reach for cleaning supplies; linen and uniform keepers reach for items in exchange; the florist while doing the flower arrangements; etc.
- Twisting: Room attendants and public cleaners have to twist their torso to clean areas around them to achieve maximum productivity.
- Crouching: This  is  required  to  clean  lower  reaches  of  furniture  like  under  dressers  and wardrobe lower shelves. Gardeners have to crouch to tend to floor indoor plants, etc.

- Lifting: Room attendants have to lift weighty linen off beds and maid carts; housemen have to lift heavy furniture and carpets; public area housemen have to lift furniture to re-arrange them; gardeners have to lift potted plants; and the list goes on.
- Pushing: Housekeeping personnel have to push maid carts; vacuum cleaners; shampoo machines; trolleys; etc. Gardeners push wheel barrows.

The above are only sample situations when the body is under pressure. There are countless other situations in a shift that truly challenge housekeeping personnel. Statistics show that the room attendant changes body position every three seconds while preparing a room. Assuming that the average cleaning time for a room is 40 minutes, and there are 16 rooms in a shift, a room attendant would end up doing 8000 different postures every shift. They can be classified as 'heavy' to 'very heavy' work as the energy required is approximately 4 kilo calories/min.

The question then arises, 'How do we reduce this physical stress on housekeeping personnel?' The following suggestions are useful to keep in mind:

- 1. Lighter equipment can reduce work when purchasing them. Heavy equipment including racks must be on wheels. Portability helps greatly in work management.
- 2. Motorised equipment help in relieving the effort just like the vacuum cleaners, portable bathroom scrubbers or window cleaners. With the same intention, mops and brooms must have long handles to reduce stooping, crouching and kneeling that contribute to musculosketal injuries immediately and in later years.
- 3. Modern detergents help in cleaning spots and stains easily with a swipe eliminating tedious scrubbing. The housekeeper must constantly research the market for new developments and encourage trials when suppliers arrive at the door step.
- 4. Job rotation is  one  possible approach to prevent permanent injuries. It requires workers to move to different tasks to allow muscles already stressed to rest. Room attendants could perform linen exchange duties or procure supplies from the stores. Supervisors can be rotated from floors to desk control operations or night supervisors to day shifts.
- 5. Job enlargement is  a  credible  alternative  where  the  scope  of  tasks  is  broadened  to  give balanced exposure. For example, public area cleaners can be asked to do administrative duties like general supplies; cleaning equipment; issue of equipment from stores; etc.
- 6. Teamwork is a wonderful way to reduce physical stress. Tasks can be shared like housemen doing the vacuuming of rooms or supervisors help in replenishing maid carts.
- 7. Education and training in safe work practices must be part of an ongoing agenda. Training should remove bad habits and replace them with improved work habits.

## Work Hazards & Prevention

Let us examine the areas in a housekeeping operation when accidents take place:

- 1. Falls from slippery floors; make-shift ladders; cluttered work areas; and improper carpet lay-out.
- 2. Cuts from broken glass in linen bundles and garbage.
- 3. Back pains from improper working postures.
- 4. Muscle cramps from improper lifting.
- 5. Breathing problems and burns from the use of hazardous chemicals and detergents.

<!-- image -->

- 6. Electrocution from live electric wires and improper maintenance and use of equipment.
- 7. Injuries due to improper work habits.

Let us look at each of these and examine how to prevent them:

## Falls

- 1. Use 'Wet Floor' signs whenever washing or mopping floors. This protects both guests and employees from falls and the resultant litigation due to injuries of this nature.
- 2. Use ladders to reach higher shelves. Ladders come in many sizes from step stools to extended ladders. Here are some tips when using ladders:
- They must be stable and strong.
- The rungs must be well fixed and loose ones repaired immediately.
- Ladders come in wood and aluminium. Use aluminium ladders as they are light and look better in public areas.
- Ladders must have rubber footing to prevent slippage.
- They must have support rods so that they do not lean against walls to scratch them. Ladders without support should be kept one fourth of its length away from the wall.
- The person climbing must be free of tools in the hand.
- Climbers must face the ladder.
- The employee should not climb to the top of the ladder to prevent the ladder from becoming top heavy and losing balance.
- It is preferred to climb leaving the top two rungs.
- Employees must position the ladder so as to reach the desired spots easily.
- Over-reaching can cause imbalance to the ladder.
- It is preferable to have someone holding the ladder from below even if it has support rods. The helper can pass tools as well as caution passers by from walking below the ladder.
- It may be prudent to put a sign 'Do not walk under the ladder'.
- Employees must be prevented from using make-shift ladders like packing crates or chairs.
- 3. Cluttered workplaces have the hazard of falls. Employees must keep their areas free for easy traffic. Tools and articles must be kept against walls in corridors. Curled carpet ends can cause trips and falls. Usually hotels use synthetic carpets that are stuck to the floor to prevent curling. However, due to heavy traffic, ends get loose and pose hazards. The housekeepers must be vigilant to these carpet ends in their daily inspections and have them re-glued to the floor immediately. Rugs can cause curling over time. It is prudent to turn them over for a while so the edges regain their natural fall on the floor.

## Cuts

Any heap whether linen or garbage is a potential hazard for broken glass or exposed syringes. Cleaners must not place their hands into garbage heaps. Room dustbins must be emptied en masse into the garbage hamper of the maid cart. Room attendants are trained to shake soiled linen for guest belongings in occupied rooms. This is a good precaution as it also ensures that broken glass or other sharp objects are not hidden in folds.

## Back pains

Back pains are a common complaint among housekeeping personnel due to the sheer pressure on their backs while doing their daily chores. The secret is to keep the correct posture while doing work. A correct posture balances the neck, chest and lower back in the natural curve. Those who have to stand for hours must do so in an upright position. It is good to circulate the blood by walking around for those like linen and uniform keepers who have to stand for long hours in a fixed position at the exchange counter.

Back pains and cramps are also created by improper lifting throughout their working day. Here are few tips for correct lifting:

- Tighten stomach muscles in preparation to lift.
- Bend at the knees and not the waist. Keep the head and back straight. The strong leg muscles help in the lifting process. Leg muscles are stronger than back muscles.
- Use both hands. Lift while hugging the load as close to the body. Do not be over ambitious in carrying heavy loads. Carry loads that are comfortable and one that can get the hands around. Avoid twisting the body. Seek another persons help for heavy loads.
- Walk with firm footing ensuring that the path is clear before the task. One should be able to see ahead over the load.
- Use the leg muscles again when lowering the load at the destination following the same steps as lifting.

Back pains and cramps are also caused by sudden movements like tugging or pushing heavy carts. Ensure that movable parts are well oiled.

## Hazardous Chemicals

Housekeepers normally use mild detergents for daily use. However, potent chemicals like acids and strong detergents are unavoidable for difficult stain treatment. Exposure to such chemicals can cause allergy, nausea, burns, vomiting, breathing problems, skin rashes, blindness and even death. Cleaners must be trained in the safe use of these chemicals. Suppliers often provide the training and safety pamphlets in the use of these chemicals. Employees must be provided with safety goggles, gloves and masks for operations that involve the use of hazardous chemicals. Another aspect is their storage. Housekeepers must make sure that these items are labelled properly and stored in separate areas in the store that is not easily accessible.

## Electrocution

Housekeepers must take precautions to prevent electrical hazards. Firstly, ensure that the equipment bought has the ISI stamp of safety. This stamp is provided by local regulatory bodies confirming that equipment manufacturers have followed safety rules before they sell their equipment to clients. Secondly, ensure that employees are properly trained in the use of equipment. The manufacturers are the best people to provide this training. The housekeeper must release the employees for such training as it is not only a safety precaution for the employee but also for the equipment to ensure their long life. Thirdly, employees using the equipment must follow the following general precautions:

- Never operate them in water (unless built for water), as they are conductors of electricity.
- Ensure that connections to sockets are made with proper insulated plugs and not with open wires. Connections must be made by holding the plug firmly. The same must be followed when unplugging them.
- Switch off equipment as soon as sparks, smoke or flames are observed.

- Cords must be uncoiled before using the equipment. They should be away from traffic areas to prevent falls. Cords must not be stretched beyond their length. Extension cords are handy to extend their lengths.
- The employee must check all appliances like guest room television, coffee machine and mini-bar for loose connections. Lamps must also be checked and faulty connections reported to maintenance. Most open plug points nowadays have in-built safety features, but exposed sockets must have proper covers.

The housekeeper must also ensure a preventive maintenance schedule for the upkeep of equipment.

## Proper Work Habits

Many injuries are caused by poor work habits. These can be corrected by proper training. Housekeeping personnel can follow the tips given below:

- Smoke only in designated areas; never in the elevator in any case.
- Ensure that elevators are not overloaded and keep to the limits as indicated in the cabin.
- Use the correct equipment and accessories for cleaning.
- Do not operate equipment when not trained.
- Use accessories like gloves, masks and goggles when dealing with toxic material.
- Use ladders for climbing, not crates and boxes.
- Look for broken glass when cleaning. Dispose them in broken glass containers only, and not in garbage bags or dustbins.
- Avoid using bare hands to dip into trash cans for fear of cuts from glass or razor blades.
- Use the handrails while climbing steps.
- Untangle cords of equipment before use and keep them away from pathways.
- Report any safety hazards if it cannot to be rectified by the self.
- Rely on maintenance to complete fixing jobs. They are the experts.
- Check equipment for their serviceability.

## FIRST AID

Housekeeping personnel must be skilled at first aid as they could be on the spot to give immediate attention to a guest or employee in distress. First aid is a part of the overall safety programme. Many hotels organise training classes run by the Red Cross, St. John's Ambulance or similar health organisations, who award certificates of completion of first aid programmes in recognition of its importance. Large hotels may have their own basic clinic with a qualified nurse.

In preparing for first aid, the first step is to have a first aid cupboard or box in a central location. The cupboard could be located at the desk control room due to its easy accessibility to all housekeeping personnel. The cupboard should contain the following items:

Clinical thermometer

Cotton wool

Bandage roll ½', 1', & 2'

Adhesive dressings (band-aids), etc.

Sterilised gauze

Tweezers

Bed pan and urine bottle

Rubber sheeting Safety pins Tincture iodine Tincture enzoine Junction violate solution

Dettol Burnol or Furacin Crocin tablets Aspirins Mercurochrome Fruit salts Antiseptic creams

## FIRE PREVENTION

In dealing with this subject it is necessary to understand that it falls into two separate categories (a) fire prevention and (b) fire-fighting.

## (a) Fire Prevention

Fire prevention is that step taken to ensure that fire does not occur. One of the most important requirements for fire prevention is good housekeeping that falls under the jurisdiction of the maintenance department rather than the housekeeping department. However, the housekeeping department is involved in a major way through orderliness and the elimination of hazards. Housekeeping personnel reach all parts of the hotel during the day and night and are therefore the eyes of the property in preventing, locating and reporting fire.

The chief engineer is the chief fire officer to fight fire in the hotel. He lends support in fire prevention by organizing and supervising fire drills for all staff. He is responsible for the fire fighting equipment and training his maintenance team as fire patrols as well as fire-fighters. Given below are some of the fire prevention methods:

## Stairs

In most hotels the service stairway is also the fire escape. Stairways are hazardous even under the most favourable conditions. It is important to keep steps clean and free of oily substances that cause slippage. Steps and rails must be kept structurally safe. Passageways should always be kept well lit and clean and free of obstruction and debris. Keeping stair shaft areas clean and bright, with suitable light coloured paints, lends a great deal to promoting general safety. Most stairways lead to fire escape doors that are different from the usual exit doors. These doors have a push lever to exit. These doors must be kept clear and only used for fire emergencies.

## Care of Fire Extinguishers

Fire extinguishers may be rarely used, however, when needed, they must work. All fire apparatus, including extinguishers, hoses, valves and sprinkler systems should be inspected semi-annually and carry tags indicating the date of inspection and the initials of the inspector. This work is delegated to trained maintenance department employees or by an outside contractor. Used extinguishers and hoses are never replaced until they have been properly serviced.

In the case of used woven fire hoses, the procedure to re-house them in the hose niches, involves stretching the hoses flat and drying them thoroughly before replacing them. If this procedure is not followed, weak spots will develop which rupture the moment water pressure is applied.

Tank type (soda acid, fog and foam) extinguishers must be recharged. This work should be done by experienced professional people.

In  addition  to  the  periodic  inspection  described  above,  it  is  necessary  that  the  soda  acid extinguishers be tested at least every two years to ensure the solidity of the outside container and to ascertain the condition of the discharge hose and nozzle. These tests will avoid the possibility of explosion which can occur where tank bodies are weakened by corrosion or blocked nozzles. Both housekeeping and maintenance department employees should constantly be on the alert to ensure that fire extinguisher stations are not used to store or serve as temporary resting places for room service trays or cleaning materials.

## Fire Regulations

In  following  the  suggested  procedure  outlined  above,  each  hotel  should  develop  a  set  of  fire regulations. These regulations should be printed, framed and posted adjacent to every extinguisher and in service landings and personnel locker rooms.

## Fire Detection Systems

All hotels nowadays have to comply with fire safety regulations to get a licence. This requires installing  fire  detection  systems  and  people  training.  Many hotels are at threat of having their licence revoked if fire safety is not provided on an ongoing basis. There are different methods of fire detection:

## Fire Alarm Systems

The fire alarm system is a method when alarm bells ring when activated. Hotels provide these fire push buttons, enclosed in glass and painted in red, at strategic points throughout the hotel. Normally such points have hoses, fire axes, extinguishers and sand buckets.

Fire alarm systems should be tested monthly, preferably with employee fire drills. Alarm bells must be reset and the glass replaced immediately following the fire or fire drill. This is a responsibility of the chief engineer.

The Chief Engineer ensures that the fire alarm system has an uninterrupted supply of electric power by connecting it to an emergency generator or batteries.

## Smoke Detection Systems

Most hotel rooms have smoke detectors. Smoke detectors trip the alarm system if the smoke exceeds permissible limits. They set alarms in fire detection panels located in the telecommunications room or the engineering control room. There are two types of smoke detectors: photoelectric and ionisation. Photoelectric systems go off when smoke obstructs a beam of light located inside the detector. Ionisation detectors sense smoke when there is a shift of electrical conductivity between two plates.

## Sprinkler Systems

Sprinklers are set off by heat not smoke. Therefore, even if the smoke detector indicates a fire, the sprinkler will not be set off. The sprinkler system has sensitive glass bulbs that crack with a certain degree of heat letting loose open water valves that sprinkle water in the area. They are located in ceilings of guest rooms, public areas, linen room and those areas prone to fire. The sprinkler systems are fed from dedicated water reservoirs that must be full at all times. Small hotels may create their swimming pool on the rooftop to double as a fire reservoir also.

## Fire Doors

Fire doors are provided, especially in long corridors to seal of a section of the corridor affected by fire. Like other fire equipment, when the need arises, their proper functioning is very important. Therefore, they should be under constant maintenance. Fusible links and door closers should be inspected semi-annually and fire doors must never be blocked.

## Fire Drills

The management must organise 'employee fire brigades' around a cadre of maintenance department employees. This brigades respond to an alarm and arrive at the scene properly equipped in less than two minutes.

Employees of other departments such as housemen, maids and waiters can be organized to assist in such tasks as removing furniture, directing guests, etc. Properly organized drills held on a monthly or by-monthly basis can serve as a very effective weapon in preparing for a potential emergency.

## Fire Protection Checklist

The manager of each hotel should either personally review the use of a Fire Protection Checklist (Fig. 31.1) or delegate the responsibility to the engineering department. Defective items as a result of the review should be promptly entered in a log book for correction. The management should follow up on the correction of defective items. A notation should be made in the log book when the defect has been eliminated.

## (b) Firefighting

Housekeeping personnel most probably will be the first to locate a fire and will have to take the initial steps in the firefighting chain. In the first instance, they need to know how to classify fires and the methods of extinguishing them. Some fires call for a wetting and cooling method below the ignition point. Others require a blanketing effect which either excludes or dilutes oxygen to a point where it will not support combustion.

## Classification of Fires

For all practical purposes, there are three general classes of fires.

## Class A

These fires are caused by ordinary dry combustible materials such as wood, textiles, paper, rubbish, etc. In these fires water quenches and cools the burning materials.

<!-- image -->

## Class B

These fires are caused by inflammable liquids such as oils, grease, petrol, chemicals, etc. In these fires a blanketing effect is essential to snuff out oxygen.

## Class C

These fires caused by electrical equipment and short-circuits that require non-conductive agents to extinguishing them.

To deal with such emergencies, experts have developed fire extinguishers to deal with initial fires of a low to medium magnitude:

## Types of Extinguishers

There are three types of extinguishers for hotel industry purposes. These are classified by the type of fire they are good at extinguishing. One must understand that as fires grow other combustibles may ignite needing all three types of extinguishers. Most hotel fires have been caused by electrical short circuits.

Class A fires require soda acid extinguishers, which eject water under gaseous pressure when they are inverted. They involve fires of wood and paper materials. Their use is limited to smaller fires since they contain only two and a half gallons of water. Water from hoses is used when fires are beyond the capacity of small extinguishers.

Class B fires require carbon dioxide fog or foam extinguishers for liquid, grease and oil fires.

Class C fires require  carbon  dioxide  fog  as  the  preferred  extinguishing  agent  since  it  is  nonconductive. These are used for electrical fires. Care must be exercised in using carbon dioxide extinguishers. The nozzle should never be touched with bare hands when the extinguisher is in operation.

## Distribution of Extinguishers

The following suggestions ensure the adequacy of protection over given areas:

Class One Extinguishers: These are placed in areas of light occupancy such as offices or light public areas. There should be one fire extinguisher for every 5000 square feet, so located, that an individual will not be required to travel more than 100 feet to reach the nearest extinguisher.

Class Two Extinguishers: They are located in high occupancy, where fires of a broader extent may be anticipated, such as kitchens, boiler rooms, etc. Locations of this nature should have an extinguisher for every 2500 ft.² so located that an individual will not be required to travel more than 50 feet from any point to reach the nearest extinguisher.

Class Three Extinguishers: They are positioned in hazardous work areas such as woodworking shops, upholstery shops, paint shops, etc. This class should be protected with one extinguisher for every 2500 ft.² so located that an individual would not be required to travel more than 50 feet from any point to reach the nearest extinguisher, plus special extinguishers in confined areas for special hazards. It is to be understood that fire hose racks connected to its standpipes or emergency water supplies are included in the extinguishers mentioned above.

Following is suggested sequences to enable hotels develop their own fire fighting procedure. Circumstances may not always permit adherence to all points in this line of approach, but it should prove advantageous.

- 1. Close windows and doors of the room in which the fire has started. If in a public area close doors to all surrounding rooms.
- 2. Ascertain the extent and seriousness of the fire.
- 3. Ring the fire alarm box or call switchboard operator for internal assistance. Remember that it is advantageous to avoid the hysteria which accompanies a general fire alarm by comforting them that help is on the way.
- 4. Inform the telephone operator giving a quick accurate description of the location of the fire.
- 5. Maintenance department personnel should proceed to the location immediately with extinguishers. They remove all combustible or volatile material away from the fire area.
- 6. The safety and peace of mind of the guest is most important. All personnel in contact with guests must be calm and reassuring.
- 7. If the fire is in a guest's room, the guest should be evacuated immediately into the corridor and the corridor doors and adjoining room doors should be closed.
- 8. It is recommended that the emergency stairs are used for evacuating guests.

## Security in Housekeeping

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## INTRODUCTION

We know by now that housekeeping personnel are spread across the hotel in pursuit of their cleaning and maintenance duties. They therefore become the ideal 'eyes and ears' of the organisation to detect any security threats to the organization. They become a close ally with the security department that relies on their presence throughout the hotel. The main security concerns are:

## SECURITY IN HOUSEKEEPING

The main security concerns are:

- Lost and found (discussed in Lesson 16, 'Housekeeping Control Desk', Part VI)
- Guest theft
- Employee theft
- Bomb scare

## Guest Theft

Guest theft is a reality of the hotel business. Guests take hotel items as souvenirs or plainly because the items in a hotel are useful at home. Thefts are usually from rooms where items like towels, vanity sets, soaps, bathrobes and slippers are useful for common use. Some hotels may look at such items as marketing strategies especially when items are monogrammed with the hotel logo. They may not mind if items like vanity sets, soaps and guest stationery are taken. The hotel may build such costs into the room rate. But items as towels and bathrobes are a serious concern because of their cost to replace them. Housekeeping personnel take the following precautions to prevent guest theft:

## Key Control

Following are the precautions employed in key control:

- Only authorised persons have access to guest rooms. They are the guests, floor housekeeping personnel, maintenance personnel, laundry valets, room service waiters, bell boys and security personnel (in case of emergencies).
- Registered guests are issued keys/cards and cautioned not to keep it lying around. Most modern hotels have done away with keys.
- Guests are required to hand their room keys/cards to the receptionists or deposit them into secure key boxes at the reception when leaving the premises.
- Master keys/cards are controlled very strictly. Firstly, master keys have outsized key rings to prevent the keys from being pocketed. The outsized key rings force the bearer to hold it in their hand. Secondly, master keys are issued to few legitimate personnel. They are the lobby manager and floor supervisor only. Each has to sign for them and register it into the log book. The movement of master keys is monitored closely. A master key lost is a major security threat to the property. Hotels may be forced to change the locks of the entire hotel at a great investment.

## Suspicious Movements

Following precautions are observed:

- Housekeeping personnel are trained to observe suspicious movements and report it to the security.
- Floor crews must learn to recognise guests that are registered into the hotel.
- Room maids are not permitted to open guest room doors for any guests.
- Legitimate residents are required to use their own keys and not have the room maid to open their doors.

## Departure Procedure

Hotels observe the following procedure:

- Bell boys are trained to give a quick glance at the room and bathroom before they remove guest baggage. They look for missing towels, blankets, vanity sets, pictures, mini-bar consumption, etc.
- Room maids too will follow-up the procedure if they notice a departure taking place.

It provides a chance to question the guest at the front-office cashier desk.

## Standard Issues to Guest Rooms

The ability to detect missing items is made possible by equipping rooms with a standard number of items. So if a room has two bath towels the lobby or room personnel will quickly scan the bathroom for both of them. Each item in the room is standardized in numbers for easy control and detection.

<!-- image -->

## Entry/Exit Point

A guest room has only one entry/exit door. Windows are usually secured in centrally air-conditioned or heated properties. The housekeeping personnel have window keys to open them. This feature of construction reduces the element of theft. Room doors are provided with peep holes, door chain latch and double locking facilities to secure unauthorized entry when the guest is present.

The hotel business operates mostly on trust. In spite of the precautions given above, thefts do happen by few unscrupulous guests who are exceptions rather than the rule.

## Employee Theft

Employees too find that hotel items are useful at home, e.g. towels, table napkins or bars of soap. A hotel reduces pilferage by adopting the following precautions:

## Gate Pass

An employee is required to posses a gate pass issued and authorised by the head of department whenever a hotel property is removed from the hotel.

- This gate pass is shown to the security officer at the time office from where employees exit the hotel.
- Hotels have only one employee entry and exit point to the hotel located at the back of the hotel where the time office is situated.
- The time office ensures that employees meticulously register their entry and exit on time cards.

## Spot Checks

- Security personnel conduct spot checks of employee hand bags at random to ensure that unauthorised items are not being taken out of the hotel. A hotel item in possession without a gate pass is considered as theft and liable to dismissal from service.
- Security personnel make spot checks of employee lockers periodically to ensure that hotel property is not stored there except for the employee uniform. Uniforms are not permitted outside the property.

## Limited Access

- Employees have limited access to areas of the hotel. For example, a cook is not permitted to be on a guest floor nor a swimming pool attendant in the reception.
- The hotel provides uniforms to distinguish personnel in the hotel.
- All personnel are expected to be in their designated areas only.
- Only certain personnel are permitted on the guest floor as mentioned earlier. Each has distinguishing uniforms.
- Room attendants may open the guest room doors for these authorised personnel only after verification of their intentions. She has to be present when the guest is not in.

<!-- image -->

Another aspect of limited access is the authority to enter stores. Only storekeepers and their helpers are permitted within stores and held totally accountable for items received and issued. Similarly, the keys to the housekeeping stores may be given to authorised supervisors only just as the entry to the linen and uniform rooms is only open to the linen and uniform keepers only.

## Par Stocks

Room attendants have par stocks of items on their maid carts that have to be accounted for at the end of their shifts. Similarly, guest rooms have par stocks as mentioned earlier. Room attendants are held accountable for a set of rooms and ensure that guest room par stocks are maintained. Similarly, the floor pantry maintains par stocks also, as a control measure.

## Bomb Threats

Terrorism is a new concern for all public buildings. Hotels are prime targets for explosions by radical groups who want to make a statement. Housekeeping personnel must be alert to suspicious objects around, especially those that are unaccompanied. Room attendants are trained to report anything suspicious in guest rooms whether they are drugs, excessive amounts of money, arms and bomb-like structures. A hotel would have worked out an emergency plan to meet these threats. Most threats are just threats and do not require alerting guests.

## True or False

- 1. Housekeeping is the 'eyes and ears' of security.
- 2. Some hotels treat guest theft as a marketing strategy.
- 3. Master keys are issued to all management staff only.
- 4. Master keys lost pose least problems to the hotel.
- 5. Room maids may open guest rooms to other visitors of the guest.
- 6. Bell-boys check on guest theft.
- 7. Par stocks are a measure of controlling theft.
- 8. An important measure to control guest theft is the gate pass.
- 9. Employees may take their uniforms home.
