## Introduction

The hospitality industry is anything but dull. Each year brings with it a bounty of exciting destinations, revolutionary new hotels and glamourous renovations. As we enter a new decade, the number of international tourists is continually rising, and new hotels keep popping up to soak up the growing demand. But whereas the challenges of the previous 20 years were mainly tied to one overarching paradigm shift - digitisation - the decade ahead brings with it a number of industrydisrupting trends that are changing what it means to be a hotelier.

10 years ago, hoteliers were still wondering if they should invest in in-room Wi-Fi (yes) and charge guests extra for the service (no). What has them biting their nails now is whether or not to become retailers, neighbourhood cafes, coworking spaces or art galleries. Every part of the hotel business, from changing customer expectations to interior design and zoning, is being challenged. The traditional selling-rooms-and-breakfast business model no longer reflects what it means to manage a hotel. Hence the need for a new unifying concept.

In this context, hoteliers need clarity and insight, which is precisely why we have developed the Hotel Concept Handbook, in association with Ecole hôtelière de Lausanne (EHL). Building on our experience working for both leading

hospitality brands and independent hoteliers, we have put together a guide presenting the major trends that affect the industry, from retail convergence to community integration. The handbook features a presentation of our very own Hotel Concept Framework to help hoteliers better adapt to their complex and everchanging environment. The framework, developed by Creative Supply, has been used to create winning hotel concepts for our customers. For hoteliers, it helps to create integrated, compelling concepts that attract the interest of guests and industry professionals alike by linking storytelling to operations or design. Proof of its success, our Hotel Concept Framework is now taught every year to students at EHL, one of the leading hospitality and management schools in the world.

This handbook is the ultimate hands-on guide for ambitious hoteliers who want to create or refine their hotel concept, and challenge today's vision of hospitality complete with case studies showing the Hotel Concept Framework in action. We hope you will enjoy reading it, and look forward to your feedback.

## Mise en Place

## Why this handbook ?

There are two main types of hospitality publications. On one side, beautiful coffee table books filled with pictures of iconic hotels show an attractive if incomplete panorama of the best in hotel design. Opposite them you find technical publications, useful manuals that explain the inner workings of a hotel in detail, from construction and service standards to yield management

and pricing models. We wanted to bring together both the hotel design and hotel management worlds to tackle a transversal subject: the hotel concept. This handbook is an effort to bridge the two disciplines and offer hoteliers informative, useful and inspiring content they can use when designing or renovating a property.

'  We wanted to bring together the worlds of hotel design and management '

## Who is it for ?

This handbook will prove equally useful to independent hoteliers and small hotel chains looking for strategic guidance, and to big hotel companies looking to improve their hotel experience. Our versatile Hotel Concept Framework can be used for both new builds and renovations, and even as a benchmarking tool to validate or refine an existing hotel concept.

## What is a hotel concept ?

Many hotels rely solely on interior designers for the development of their hotel concept. But a hotel cannot thrive on design alone. A hotel concept goes beyond aesthetics and integrates all the constituent elements of hotel operation into a coherent and compelling whole. Starting with its unique story, it defines what a hotel looks like, what services it offers, how it presents and markets itself and how its staff interacts with guests.

## What are the benefits of having a hotel concept ?

A well-executed hotel concept offers many benefits in both development and operating phases. Here are just a few :

- -  Alignment between stakeholders around a shared vision
- -  A price premium on room rates and extras
- -  A coherent and compelling guest experience
- -  A reduction in PR and marketing costs, as concept-led hotels are inherently easier to market
- -  An attractive opportunity for talented staff to join an exciting and meaningful project
- -  A marketable platform for investors and partners when pitching the project

## What's inside the handbook ?

Our Hotel Concept Handbook is split into three parts. In the first, you will discover some of the defining trends shaping the hospitality industry, and how they can affect or influence a hotel concept. The second part revolves squarely around the Hotel Concept Framework: what it is, how it works, and how you can use it to create or refine your own hotel concept. The last part of the handbook is a practical application of the Hotel Concept Framework. Here, we explore 5 successful hotel concepts and use the framework to break down their formula for success.

## Industry Dematerialisation

Every hotel outlet is now being disrupted by a digital equivalent. That's not necessarily a bad thing for hoteliers.

<!-- image -->

1

F or centuries, the core of the hotel business has been essentially the same everywhere. Sell rooms, check in the guests, serve breakfast and check them out. But now Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) have taken over the booking element, apps like Deliveroo and Uber Eats offer a myriad of breakfast, lunch and dining options, and Airbnb is challenging even the room portion of the business. This disruption has forced hoteliers to rethink their value proposition around a simple question: what can I offer that these digital upstarts can't ?

One answer to this question has been to provide guests with unique on-site experiences. These can exist in many forms, but they should all tie into the hotel concept. Most importantly, they must

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

be hard to replicate, be it by rival hotels or Airbnb-type platforms. Take French Theory, a new hotel recently opened on Paris's Left Bank. The hotel showcases its ties with France's music scene via a number of outlets including in-house LP players and a basement 'Audio Lab' featuring a listening room and a recording studio. Guests can book the studio, or just sit back and enjoy as visiting musicians launch an impromptu jam session (later streamed on the hotel's Spotify channel). In Kyoto, the BnA Alter Museum has combined hotel and art gallery, adorning

- The Diner Club at Paris's French Theory serves as both the hotel library and as a meeting and event space available for rental. 2

all their rooms with works by local artists. The hotel also offers residency programmes and art-related events for guests and locals alike. If an experience is unique (at least locally), matches with the hotel concept, and can be monetised, then it can bring value to a property.

The other option is to double down on service quality and operational excellence. It turns out many Airbnb users would happily trade a so-called authentic setting

'  What services can hotels offer that digital upstarts can't ? '

for the comforts of quality bedding and good coffee in the morning. Depending on the hotel location and its target audience, paring back the guest experience to its key components can be a winning strategy. CitizenM hotel rooms essentially consist of a bed and a shower room, but the quality of both is top-notch. Some hotels invest so much in one particular feature that it becomes a well-known part of the brand, as is the case with Westin's Heavenly Bed: a bed so successful it is now its own independent brand, available for purchase online. The bottom line here is that not all hotels have to provide dozens of amenities (dog spas, water sommeliers, …). As long as the guest expectations are fulfilled, that can be enough.

Balancing Facts and Emotions

<!-- image -->

## Retail and Hospitality Convergence

<!-- image -->

Hotels and retail companies are finally realising that they have a lot in common. It's time for hotels to harness that potential.

H ospitality retail was once little more than a lobby corner shop and some display windows. But in recent years, hotels have started to see the marketing and revenue potential retail presents. When it launched in 2006, the Hoxton Hotel London's front desk, which doubles as a retail counter, was a pioneer. Since then, brands like 25hours and W Hotels have gone to great lengths to integrate retail into their value proposition.

'Hotels have started to see the marketing and revenue potential retail presents.'

<!-- image -->

An increasing number of new real estate developments are bringing retail and hospitality closer together. It makes sense. Both activities aim to optimise revenue per square meter and offer an immersive customer experience. The lavish reopening of La Samaritaine in Paris by the LVMH group in 2020 features a department store operated by duty-free specialist DFS alongside a Cheval Blanc hotel, thus making full use of the available space. And existing hotels are not waiting on the sidelines: Italy's iconic Pellicano hotel group partnered with luxury e-tailer MATCHESFASHION in the summer of 2019 to provide a pop-up store aboard a 1930s yacht, servicing the group's three Italian properties and offering an exciting experience to their guests.

<!-- image -->

' Retail  companies use hotels to contextualise their offering and engage their customers in a less transactional way.'

- The Maisons du Monde hotel in Nantes, France, offers 5 different room styles, each decorated with the brand's signature furnishings. 11
- The MUJI flagship store in Ginza takes up the first six floors of a building, with the hotel rooms and facilities located on the higher floors. 12

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Many retail companies have actually ventured into the hotel business in an effort to contextualise their products and engage their customers in a less transactional, more meaningful way. Within the past two decades, fashion and jewellery brands Armani, Fendi and Bulgari have all opened hotels, as have home decor companies Muji and Maisons du Monde. Hoteliers, however, have been slow to do the opposite. Compared to these concepts with strong individual identities, chains like Westin and Hilton are missing an opportunity to assert who they are, and create a full brand universe.

- W Hotels' 'The Store' allows anyone to buy a piece of the W experience, from luxury bedding to branded fashion and accessories. 8
- The rooms at MUJI Hotel Ginza are designed in the brand's minimalist style, and furnished almost exclusively with Muji products. 9
- 10 The Maisons du Monde hotel lounge has a distinctively homely vibe, and can serve as a showroom for the brand's products.

As customer expectations towards hotels evolve, the traditional model in which rooms create revenue and facilities serve as support is fading. And whilst hotels will continue to rely on their rooms as their main revenue source, a thoughtful retail strategy can help drive the overall perceived value of a hotel  - and offer a welcomed additional revenue stream.

## Rethinking Distribution

Global distribution is no longer a competitive advantage for hotels. New channels are necessary.

'OTAs have become a commodity.'

<!-- image -->

W hen online travel agencies (OTAs) arrived at the turn of the millennium, they levelled the playing field between big global brands and local hoteliers. A 3-room B&B in the Alps or a family-run Italian osteria could enjoy the same online visibility as a Marriott or a Mercure hotel, attracting customers from all over the world. But now, every hotel uses the same tools for distribution and OTAs have become a commodity. That means it's once again harder for smaller hotels or chains to stand out against big brands. To make matters worse, standard layouts and quantitative search criteria (number of stars, room price, average user reviews) are making it even harder for hotels to showcase their unique attributes.

- The owners of La Bandita Countryhouse like to rely on word-of-mouth as much as on traditional listings for bookings. 13

To stand apart from the crowd, hoteliers must now seek out new distribution channels. Some have benefitted from the rise in niche travel guides from the likes of Wallpaper, Monocle or Louis Vuitton. Others have started using local partners with complementary offerings as ambassadors. The Waldhotel at the Bürgenstock resort near Lake Lucerne in Switzerland has partnered with renowned private clinics in the area, who refer their patients to the hotel. In Amsterdam, the Student Hotel relies in part on referrals from local demand generators such as universities and student guides. This type of strategy helps hotels ground themselves in the local scene, offering a more authentic experience and creating new revenue streams tied to local visitors.

Affinity-based referencing is another way for hoteliers to stand out, especially when they have a strong concept. For instance, road trip enthusiasts booking a vintage van on Washington-based platform PacWesty are encouraged to stay at the Kimpton Hotel Vintage in Seattle before or after their trip. Virgin hotels are active on local Reddit forums, offering advice on activities, attractions - and where to stay, of course. Social media apps such as Pinterest and Instagram have also become ideal outlets for hotels to advertise, providing more creative control over the experience than with OTAs. So long as they can be tied back to the hotel concept, these new outlets can boost a hotel's perceived value, reach a more qualitative audience and increase direct reservations.

14

- The Student Hotel in Amsterdam provides large and flexible classrooms and workspaces that can be used in different setups and booked for events. 14

Published since 1998, the Louis Vuitton City Guides have amassed a cult following among well-heeled and aspirational customers alike. 15

## Community Integration

It is not just customers who crave a sense of community. Hotels need to belong, too.

B elonging is an existential human need. On the famous Maslow pyramid of needs, belonging ranks third, just after physiological and safety needs. When traveling, our modern, connected lifestyles offer countless options for networking or for unearthing 'local gems' - yet many travellers feel isolated when visiting a new city.

<!-- image -->

- Interiors at Soho House locations strive to recreate a sense of belonging, and are influenced by local aesthetic styles and traditions (seen here, Soho House 76 Dean Street in London).

<!-- image -->

17

To capitalise on this need, savvy hoteliers have devised concepts that heavily market a community aspect. Brands like the Hoxton, Soho House and the Devonshire Club in London have built a cult following on the premise of offering accommodation to a community of like-minded people. They provide spaces for guests to meet and work together, and activities linked to the interests of their well-defined audience. Soho House has taken things one step

further, only accepting new members if they have been co-opted, like a traditional members' club. The final step in this version of the community experiment is co-living, where guests share living units for weeks, months or even years at a time. Once reserved for so-called 'digital nomads' living for a few months at an Outpost in Bali or Cambodia, coliving is gradually attracting followers in large, expensive cities, with companies

like Roam offering multiple locations from San Francisco to Tokyo.  But guests aren't the only ones who need to connect with their surroundings. Hotels that manage to become a hub for their city or neighbourhood can offer a more immersive experience to their out-of-town guests, while generating new revenue streams thanks to local demand. In Paris' 10 th arrondissement, Le Grand Quartier aspires to do just that, combining a hotel, a café,

shops and a workspace under the same roof.

Successful communities are connected by a golden thread. It can be a place, a shared belief or an aspiration, but it has to be defined. Conversely, that means some people will feel left out. Hotels have to resist the need to be 'everything to everyone', lest they lose that sense of belonging.

21

22

## Authentic Immersion

As the world reaches new heights of mass-tourism, it's time for hotels to finally be different.

W e live in an age of unprecedented freedom when it comes to travel, and low-cost airlines and online deals have made most corners of the world easily accessible. But instead of diversity, a cursory look at social media brings up the same pictures of infinity pools overlooking Bondi Beach, hot air balloons in the skies of Cappadocia and forlorn maiko - geishas in training - hurrying along the streets of Kyoto. A 2017 study by rental home insurer Schofields found that 40% of millennial UK travellers consider 'instagramability' a deciding factor when it comes to picking a travel destination.

Hotels have been adapting, changing their interior design, amenities and activities to reflect popular trends, with no link to their own unique concept. Discovery, escapism and relaxation - what made traveling exciting in the first place - are being replaced by bucket lists, must-sees and like counters. Predictably, however, hotels that blindly follow social media trends are doomed to become very passé , very fast.

Seeking to avoid the masses of tourists on the hunt for a viral post, a growing number of leisure travellers are fleeing popular destinations in favour of more everyday or obscure discoveries. The rise of agritourism, where guests can reconnect with traditional nature and food, is an example of this. Coombeshead Farm in Cornwall lets guests forage their own food from the grounds, and offers breadmaking and butchery classes as well. Dark tourism, a concept where travellers discover

## The Changing Role of Hotels

While it may seem the hospitality industry is under attack from all sides, the reality is more nuanced. The pool of potential customers has never been higher, with a projected 1.8 billion international tourists by 2030, or roughly 5 million per day. Those figures even take into account some of the predicted consequences of climate change, from endangered destinations like Venice and the Maldives to social stigma toward carbon-heavy tourism. Spoiled for choice yet looking to inject more meaning into their travels, tourists will be looking beyond OTAs when it comes

to destination travel and searching for hotels they feel connected to. Above and beyond a (very) comfortable bed, hotels will have to provide impactful, sustainable and rewarding experiences, in order to stay afloat amidst the ever  - intensifying competition from new apps and websites. This new and ambivalent context calls for adaptability, and hoteliers are being faced with the challenge of rethinking their entire offering to forge a clearly defined concept that brings personality and coherence to their property. Read on to discover how to create that concept.

## Part 2 Hotel Concept Framework

At Creative Supply, we are passionate about hospitality. Whether it's working with ambitious hoteliers all over the world, or sharing our experience with young hospitality professionals, we feel strongly about making the world a more hospitable place. The Hotel Concept Framework was born as a result of this focus and, in this part, we explain how it works, why it's so useful, and raise a few questions to bear in mind while working on your own hotel concept.

## Services

<!-- image -->

## Story

Positioning Role Purpose

The Hotel Concept Framework is made up of 7 components that cover all aspects of designing and running a hotel : Story, People, Space, Identity, Services, Content and Channels. Starting from the central story, components are interconnected and work side by side to build a unique, coherent whole.

<!-- image -->

The story is both the starting point and the golden thread running through your concept.

32

## Definition

The Story lies at the heart of our Hotel Concept Framework. It defines the role of a hotel as well as its aspirations. In other words, your story conveys why guests should stay at your property, beyond just getting a room and breakfast. Having a good story presents a number of clear advantages:

- -  A story lasts virtually forever and can evolve.
- -  A story is hard to copy and can increase awareness around your property.
- -  A story is inexpensive to create, in relation to the overall cost of building or renovating a hotel.
- -  A story can trigger an emotional response and decrease price sensitivity.
- -  A story is engaging and gives journalists a reason to follow you over the years.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Questions to ask

- 1. What is the role of your hotel for your customers, employees and partners ?
- 2. Is there an idea at the core of everything you do ?
- 3. Are all aspects of the customer experience aligned with your hotel story ?
- 4.   How do you present your hotel to journalists and customers ? Do you only talk about its interior design ?

## Key considerations

To create an engaging - and lasting story, it is important to make it the starting point of your concept building process. The story is like a golden thread connecting all the components of your concept, hence the importance of having a clear picture of it before working on the rest. A story should consider the hotel's customer segments, staff and management, as well as its location and infrastructure. For instance, centring a story around avant-garde street art would not be consistent with an airport hotel run by conservative founders.

- The Brand Story Canvas is a tool created by Creative Supply to help brands create winning brand stories. Visit creativesupply.com for more on the topic of storytelling. 32

## Watch out for

It's important not to confuse story and theme. Themed hotels try to recreate a set universe (mainly through design), but few of them take the time to work on their story. A champagne-themed or sailingthemed hotel might appeal to some onetime guests, but how often would you want to visit ? A good story does not have to be literal, but it must be engaging. Over time and with the passage of guests, it will ripen and evolve.

' A story conveys why guests should stay at your hotel, beyond the bed and breakfast.'

## French Theory

Paris, France

French Theory is a new hybrid hospitality concept that recently opened their first hotel in Paris. We helped develop a story that revolves around rekindling the cultural appeal of the Parisian Left Bank, with a focus on music and art. It encourages guests to 'live creative moments'. Experiences tied to the story are built into every aspect of the hotel, from in-room art by local artists to a basement hi-fi listening room and recording studio.

## Focus The Terrass' Hotel

Paris, France

The Terrass' Hotel is a 100-room Parisian property near Montmartre. To help build their story, we dug deep into the hotel's archives and immersed ourselves in the neighbourhood environment, resulting in 'L'adresse des artistes depuis 1911' (Home to artists since 1911). The story is brought alive by the lobby, reminiscent of a theatre foyer, as well as the rooms, inspired by artist studios. The hotel rooftop has become a favourite interview spot for actors and singers.

## People

Hotels might sell rooms, but relationships are the real currency.

## Definition

## Key considerations

The People component of the framework encompasses all the people who play a part in your hotel concept. That means: your employees, your guests, your partners and, to a certain extent, your investors. Together, they bring your concept to life. In most hotel concepts, people are at the core of all interactions.

## ' People are at the core of all hotel interactions.'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The people you hire and collaborate with must all feel connected to your story. A hotel that tells a story about 'connecting people and ideas' could involve local entrepreneurs, academics and venture capitalists. A hotel wishing to 'lead people to better health' may partner with medical professionals, yoga studios or fitness coaches. You should also define who your core target customer group is (the people who connect perfectly to your story) early on. It will help you make decisions about all other aspects of your hotel concept. For example, a hotel centred around art and culture should have a core customer base made up of art curators, gallerists and journalists, and create experiences tailored to that group.

- The Good Hotel in London partners with local yoga studios for classes, tying into the hotel's commitment to supporting local business. 36
- The Good Hotel in London has implemented a scheme to train and recruit former long-term unemployed local workers into its staff. 37

<!-- image -->

## Questions to ask

- 1. Who is your aspirational target group ?
- 2. What common interests, social ambitions or passions do your guests and employees share ?
- 3. How are your guests encouraged to interact with your hotel staff ?
- 4.  Are you aligning the people you hire with the concept of your hotel ?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Watch out for

All too often, managing people is seen as a purely operational issue, primarily centred around skill training to increase quality and consistency of service. But intangible elements, like beliefs and shared values, can also significantly impact the customer experience.

London, UK

Opened in 2016, London's Good Hotel delivers a strong message : 'premium hospitality with a cause'. This translates into offering skills training to former long-term unemployed local workers, giving them a chance to reintegrate into society. They also partner with independent suppliers to support the local economy. As a result, the Good Hotel naturally attracts guests who value social enterprises.

## Space

There is more to hotel design than stunning interiors.

## Definition

In our model, the Space component relates to the physical makeup of the hotel. It encompasses the zoning, the customer flow of a hotel, as well as its interior design. A hotel space must match with its core story: a 'rebel story hotel' should be designed differently than 'a conservative elite hotel'.

'Your hotel space must be aligned with your core story.'

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Key considerations

Zoning is the first and most essential step to planning your hotel space, as it greatly impacts the customer experience. Different spaces have different purposes and require sensible placing: a quiet library space will not do well if located next to a busy restaurant or hotel bar. Refining your customer flow allows guests to circulate smoothly between different zones, which reduces stress and can create new opportunities for generating revenue. Interior design should come last in the space design process. The brief should consider the story, as well as both zoning and customer flow. Integrating these variables upstream of the design process lets interior designers focus on aesthetic quality to bring your story to life with the right combination of furniture pieces, textiles, materials and decorative objects.

<!-- image -->

## Watch out for

Consider cultural and social norms when designing a space. Narrow corridors and dim lighting will encourage your guests to be quiet, while a bar area with high stools and loud music will encourage social interaction.

<!-- image -->

## Questions to ask

- 1. Does the zoning of your hotel consider the overall customer flow ?
- 2. How can you use interior design to tell your hotel's story ?
- 3. How does your physical environment make your guests feel ?
- 4.  Are you optimising every square metre of your hotel ?

Tokyo, Japan

The hotel koé in Shibuya, Tokyo, is a great example of mindful spatial design. Their hotel concept revolves around 'new basics for new culture', merging hospitality, retail, food and entertainment under one roof. The space has been designed to balance efficiency and revenue generation with guest privacy and comfort: the ground floor houses a bar-restaurant-bakery space that draws in outside traffic. Above, the first floor is dedicated to Koé's eponymous fashion label, while the hotel reception and rooms are located on the upper floors. This protects guests from the hustle and bustle of the street below.

## Identity

People do judge a book by its cover be ambitious about your hotel's look and feel.

## Definition

## Key considerations

The Identity element in the framework encompasses all the graphic, verbal and sensorial aspects of a hotel concept. From corridor signage to website layout and up to the hold music, each and every ingredient is an opportunity for a hotel to assert its unique identity. Since these items are experienced by guests before, during and after their stay, the identity they express must be fully coherent with the story of your hotel.

'  The  identity  must be fully coherent with the story of your hotel.'

Visual identity plays a particularly important role in creating an identity. It also contributes to your hotel's perceived value: stellar website design is good advertising in and out of itself. The visual identity you develop also extends to the content you create. Your Instagram posts, trade show banners, YouTube videos make sure that your content is always 'onbrand'. Repetition and consistency will help ingrain your concept into the minds of your customers. An often overlooked but highly effective way to build a special connection with your guests is your sensorial identity. The scent of fresh croissants in the morning might convince a guest not to skip breakfast. Replacing the complimentary chocolate by a local delicacy may create an extra connection with your surroundings. Even the choice of toilet paper can have unexpected effects on your guests' wellbeing.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Watch out for

Clichés and stereotypes can ruin an otherwise authentic experience. Be sure to avoid pictures of soulless city views or worse, stock images - and do not use local landmarks as a replacement for a hotel logo. Sensorial experiences need to be subtle too. A funky playlist can enliven

your bar in the evening, but is likely to drive away guests if it's playing the next day at breakfast. Pay particular attention to the smell and composition of bathroom products: nothing ruins a good shower like blatantly artificial fragrances and a dry scalp.

<!-- image -->

## Questions to ask

- 1. Do your hotel name and visual identity match with your hotel story ?
- 2. Does your hotel stimulate all five senses ? Does it have its own smell ? Its own sound ?
- 3. What is your hotel's tone of voice ?
- 4.  Is your identity timeless or just trendy ?

Water sommeliers are not necessary for a hotel to work. Good Wi-Fi is.

## Definition

## Key considerations

The framework's Services component covers the services and amenities offered to guests before, during and after their stay. Spanning everything from the essential (Wi-Fi, housekeeping) to the exotic (dog concierge, selfie assistant), services offer a myriad of possibilities for guest interactions, and help enrich the customer experience. Of course, services that tie in with your hotel story are particularly valuable, as they can strengthen your overall concept. In-room poker sets and whisky tastings will bring a distinctive appeal to a hotel whose story revolves around 'great times with friends'.

' Consider  which services actually add value to the guest experience.'

When building a hotel concept, the level of services offered is an important consideration. Depending on your positioning and target audience, you could settle on anything from the barebone experience of a no-frills hostel or motel to the 'your-wish-is-my-command' approach of some palace hotels.

The degree of technology is also important. While a free - and reliable - Wi-Fi connection is now considered a commodity in most hotels, some establishments also offer Bluetooth speakers, connected TVs with Netflix or Apple TV, or chatbot concierges available anytime, anywhere. It's important to consider which of these services actually add value for your guests, and whether they make sense in relation to the story. Signature services are often exclusive to a specific hotel or location. When devised as an extension of the hotel story, they can leave a lasting impression on the customer and generate great PR value. For instance, a wilderness retreat could offer a digital detox kit for guests wishing to reconnect with nature.

<!-- image -->

## Watch out for

Start with the basics. It doesn't matter how exhaustive your service catalogue is, if the bedroom is dirty or the water cold, your customers won't be back. Structure your offering with different service levels, from essential to nice-to-have, and make sure you deliver on what you promise. In a similar logic, always stop to consider how your services match with your story, your positioning and your audience. A good service offering should be an investment, not a burden.

<!-- image -->

## Questions to ask

- 1. Map out all possible service touchpoints in your customer journey. Which ones are indispensable ? Which ones can you do without ?
- 2. Did you define standards for service excellence ? How are you empowering your staff to deliver on them ?
- 3. Do you have a signature service that expresses your hotel story ?

## Content

Don't just host your guests  create content to engage them all year round.

## Definition

Our framework's Content component defines the intellectual property and communication assets a hotel develops. These come in many forms, from website articles to a a line of fashion accessories. You might have a weekly podcast series about unconventional travel destinations or perhaps a short documentary showcasing your region. Good content can help you showcase multiple facets of your story, which helps to educate your target audience, improves your brand's reputation, and generates free press. It will also help you stay in touch with your guests even if they've only been to your property once.

## Key considerations

When creating content, it's important to make sure it aligns with your story and that the format is consistent with your identity. This creates a positive feedback loop around your key messages, giving a valuable boost to your visibility and reputation. You do not have to create and distribute content all by yourself. If the story you tell is compelling, it will attract attention from newspapers and influencers on the lookout for the next hidden gem. You can also leverage your local network by partnering up with associations, university students or local businesses to create content for you. If you can create value for the community, the community will help spread your name.

## Watch out for

Keep in mind that content creation rarely generates instant results. You should consider it as a long-term investment that will help you secure a desirable position in the future. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

<!-- image -->

## Questions to ask

- 1. How can you use your story, people and space to generate engaging content ?
- 2. What are your customers' expectations ? What do you want them to know ?
- 3. Should your content educate, entertain or inspire ?
- 4.  Who could you collaborate with to produce content ?

## Channels

Your story deserves to be heard. Make sure you use the right channels.

## Definition

## Key considerations

The Channel component in our framework encompasses all digital channels as well as the real-world activities and events a hotel organises to bring their story to life. From your OTA booking page to your endof-year theme party, channels represent all the marketing touchpoints between you and your guests.

'Channels represent all the marketing touchpoints between you and your guests.'

Digital channels include booking platforms and social media accounts - they are crucial to hotel management. But the overwhelming amount of information available online makes it incredibly difficult to create an emotional connection with guests via these channels alone. Face-to-face interactions are hard to beat when it comes to engaging people. These elements combined will make the story come alive. Depending on your story and concept, possible activities might include a flea market, movie nights, modern art exhibitions or outdoor pilates classes. Channels can also take the form of collaborations and, in certain cases, drive direct bookings to your hotels. If you run a wellness resort, for example, you could ask yoga studios in your feeder markets to refer customers to your establishment in exchange for a commission. Turning collaborations into distribution channels works best if the hotel story matches with the partner story (shared beliefs), making the commercial nature of the relationship less obvious to customers.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Watch out for

To avoid a disconnect between strategy and operations, Story, Content and Channels should always work hand-inhand. Inviting a jazz band to play in the lobby of your airport hotel on Saturday nights might help you sell more beer, but if jazz has no connection with your story, it won't help strengthen your concept over the long term.

<!-- image -->

## Questions to ask

- 1. Categorise all the communication and distribution channels you use. Are they sufficient ? Do they complement each other ?
- 2. Do you organise activities or events to attract guests and locals ?
- 3. Are you consistently linking your story to your content and channels ?
- Many hotels have started partnering with yoga studios to offer guests and locals a popular wellness experience without the high costs of running a hotel spa or gym. 64

## A Framework for Success

From a distance, one might think a hotel concept is nothing more than the sum of a few separate parts. A good story here, trendy design there, and a quirky social presence to wrap it all in and, voilà , you've got yourself a hotel concept. But hoteliers worldwide have proven that a good concept paired with excellent execution provides an experience that transcends each individual element. A good concept also provides the perfect template for sustainable growth,

as new experiences serve to actualise and reinforce the concept over time.

There are countless ways to innovate and improve on a hotel experience. That's why we hope to see hoteliers far and wide using our Hotel Concept Framework to do just that. If you have a great hotel concept you'd like to share with the hospitality world, send it our way. We'd be delighted to feature it.
