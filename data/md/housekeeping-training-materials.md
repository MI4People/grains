## Definition of the Term Motel

The  term  motel  is  a  contraction  of  motor  hotel.  It  is  a lodging  facility  that  caters  primarily  to  guests  arriving  by automobiles.  Early  motels  often  provide  parking  spaces near guestrooms, but that has changed in recent years  as motel owners and franchisors have become more aware of guest security

Motels may be located in any setting, but are usually found in  suburban  or  roadside  areas.  They  became  especially successful in the 1950's and 1960's with the development of the inter-state highway system in the US. Many motels are

## Housekeeping Department Organization Chart

The organization chart of housekeeping department should provide a clear picture of the lines of authority and the channels of communication with the department.

Housekeeping department chart not only provides for a systematic direction of orders, but also protects employee's form being over directed. The chart shows that each employee should take orders only from the person directly above him / her.

Also a copy of the chart should be posted in an area so that all housekeeping staff can see where they fit into the overall organization of the department. Ideally all hotels place the organization chart on ether the housekeeping control desk room or the place where usually the daily briefing happens.

## Housekeeping Department

The Housekeeping Department is one of the busiest sections in the hotel as far as the variety of functions performed, and number of staff working. It is usually situated at the laundry room or any other convenient place close to Housekeeping Supplies.

The Housekeeping Department is responsible for:

- Neatness and Cleanliness of all guest rooms and most public areas
- Maintenance of recycled and non-recycled cleaning inventories

Some of the above mentioned functions might however be leased to a concessionaire. In this case, hotel shall still have a housekeeping department but to a minimum number of staff!

The  Housekeeping  Department  is  headed  by  an  Executive  Housekeeper  (sometimes  referred  to  as Housekeeping Manager)

The  procedure  of  cleaning  guest  rooms  by  the  housekeeping  department  can  be  summarized  in  the following way:

- 1. Checkout clerk (or cashier)  contacts  the  Housekeeping Department that a room became vacant and needs cleaning!

<!-- image -->

- 2. Housekeeping Department updates the room status from occupied to on-change and sends a room maid to clean the room

<!-- image -->

## BASIC SKILLS

<!-- image -->

## HOUSEKEEPING

- 3. Room maid cleans  the  room  and  contacts  the  housekeeping  department  back  about  the  latest status and condition of the room (especially for out-of-order and out-of-service!)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 4. If the room is Out Of Order for any reason (i.e. Room is extensively dirty, or needs repair!), then the Housekeeping Department deducts that room from those available for sale, until either scheduled to be extensively cleaned or post to the confirmation from the Maintenance Department that the deficiency was repaired!
- 5. Housekeeping  Department  sends  their  inspectors  to  check  whether  the  stated  room  has  been cleaned to the hotel standards or not!
- 6. If the room is cleaned to hotel's standards, the Housekeeping Department shall update the room status from On-Change to Clean and Available for Sale and communicate this to the Front Office Department!

<!-- image -->

- If  the  room  is  not  cleaned  to  hotel  standards,  inspectors  communicate  to  the  Housekeeping
- 7. Department that the room shall be cleaned again!

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Inter-relationship between Housekeeping and Front Office Departmnet

The main two important areas where collaboration is vital between the Housekeeping and Front Office Department are listed below:

- 1. Have always clean rooms for expected arrivals and stay overs
- 2. Satisfy special guest needs as far as amenities and facilities requested in their rooms are concerned

<!-- image -->

## 1. Cleaning and Inspection Process

The Room Status for each room determines how  much  effort,  time,  labour,  and  hence scheduled staff is needed by the Housekeeping Department on any shift.

The  Housekeeping  Department  shall  first clean rooms for expected arrivals first, then stay  over  rooms  and  eventually  vacant rooms!  The  reason  is  that  rooms  for  new arrivals  takes  more  time  to  be  cleaned  to hotel standards again and that guests might come any time to request their rooms even before  the  pre-determined  beginning  of

check-in time!

That's why; the Housekeeping Department shall be communicated from the reservation department on a daily basis Expected Arrival, Stay over, and Departure Lists to be able to schedule the optimum number of room maids and inspectors for the expected business volume!

Moreover,  bearing  in  mind  the  cleaning  procedure  of  guest  rooms  explained  above,  there  should  be  a communication  between  the  Front  Office  Department  and  Housekeeping  Department  to  be  able  to communicate the recent room status of each room! This communication is vital because nobody would like to  make  a  guest  wait  in  the  lobby  because  his/her  room  is  not  yet  clean  or  due  to  the  fact  that  the Housekeeping Department did not communicate on real time the status to the Front Office! Lastly, the Housekeeping Department shall ensure that every room maid shall use efficiently most of his valuable time in cleaning not in going back and forth in the corridors!

## 2. Room Status Report

During the guest stay, the housekeeping status of the guestroom changes several times. The various terms defined  are  typical  of  the  room  status  terminology  of  the  lodging  industry.  Not  every  room  status  will occur for each and every guest during their stay at the hotel.

Changes in this status should be promptly communicated to the front office in order to maximize the room sales  and revenue. Maintaining timely housekeeping status requires close coordination and cooperation between the front desk and the house keeping department.

## Work Place Hazardous Materials Information

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Workers  in  this  industry  face  a variety of both physical and environmental  hazards.  Because of  this  occupation's  high  level  of injury risk, supervisors and building  management  must  take precautions to protect these workers  from  harm.  Without  a janitor or building cleaner  to disinfect  objects  and  surfaces, repair lighting fixtures and perform maintenance on the environmental systems that make

workspaces comfortable, employees' workdays would be much more hazardous, unclean and unpleasant. That is why cleaning staff needs to be able to read warnings on labels that describecleaning solutions and other dangerous substances.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## SELECTION OF CLEANING AGENTS

- 1. Mild cleaning agents are generally preferred for cleaning as they are less injurious.
- 2. Strong chemicals and abrasives may be easy to clean and the surface would look better, but on the long run it may damage the surface.
- 3. Cleaning  agents  have  to  be  purchased  in  manageable  containers  as  bulk  purchases  could  cause congestion in stores. The containers must have reliable lids, corks as defective ones could result in wastage due to evaporation.
- 4. Strong smelling agents like paraffin must be avoided due to the offensive smells they lend to the environment.
- 5. Pollutant free / less polluting cleaning agents should be used to protect not only the hotel staff and guests but also people at large.

## Required Items Sizing

## Standard

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Sometimes  abbreviated  as  simply  STD,  the standard designation denotes the most basic type of  room  offered  by  the  hotel  chain  or  individual property.  According  to  the  wittily  named  hotel ratings  organization  sleepingaround,  standard rooms typically offer the facility's basic room with few  luxuries  and  a  street  or  parking  lot  view. Standard  rooms  vary  considerably  from  chain  to chain,  and  hoteliers  known  for  upscale  service likely  offer  standard  rooms  with  more  features than  hotels  that  cater  to  budget  travellers.  In addition, independent and franchised hotels may label a typical room as standard and offer a lower

class  of  rooms  under  the  designation  of  budget  or  economy.  In  some  cases,  an  hotelier  may  offer  a standard room with a more desirable  view;  hotels  that  offer  this  option  may  refer  to  the  offering  as  a moderate or superior room.

## Deluxe

A  step  above  standard,  moderate  and  superior rooms, deluxe accommodations combine a desirable view with a number  of luxurious amenities.  Hotels  that  offer  optional  in-room  hot tubs,  for  example,  may  place  the  tubs  in  rooms designated as deluxe. According to Sleeping Around, deluxe rooms surpass lesser accommodations in size, furniture, view, location or any combination thereof.

## Junior Suite

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

When an hotelier takes a deluxe room and adds a separate  work  or  sitting  area,  the  classification may change to junior suite. Not quite a full suite, the junior suite gives travellers an opportunity to relax in a designated area of the room or work at an  in-room  desk.  If  the  hotel  also  offers  a kitchenette  in  the  room,  the  designation  may change to studio.

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Suite

A  suite  offers  a  separate  sitting  and/or working  area;  unlike  the  junior  edition, though, true suites separate these areas from  the  sleeping  quarters with a permanent  wall  and,  in  many  cases,  a door.  A  suite  may  or  may  not  feature  a kitchenette or a full kitchen. Also of note, Sleeping  Around  cautions  that  some hotels  market  junior  suites  as  full  suite accommodations.  To  avoid  confusion, travellers should  verify  the  features before booking a suite.

## Bed Types

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Travellers  find  a  wide  selection  of  bedding  in  hotels,  and  some  hotels  attempt  to  describe  a  room's sleeping accommodations in the room's classification. Rooms with a king-sized bed may feature a 'K' in the classification name, while a 'Q' denotes a queen bed and a 'D' signifies a double bed. Some hotels may also include the number of beds in the classification, offering rooms with two double beds (2D) or two queen beds (2Q).

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Housekeeping

And it is important for housekeeping to know what sizes of bed sheets are to be changed. Also in the room description housekeeping needs to know how many towels of witch dimensions are there to be changed as well as glasses and all changeable parts of the room. E.g. - Constance of minibar.

| Size   | Duvert cover   |           |        |        |                 |
|--------|----------------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
|        | 68 x86         | x96       |        |        | 39" x75" X17"   |
| Full   | 92             |           |        | x26    | 54" x75 X17"    |
| Queen  | 92             | 90" x102  | 20 x30 | 26 x26 | 60"x 80" - X17" |
| King   | 106            | 108" x102 | 20 X40 | 26 x26 | 78 X 80"x 17'   |

## Views

In addition to describing the arrangement of beds and furniture, a hotel room classification may denote the view. Hotels often market rooms designated with an ocean view (OV), Mountain View (MV) or city view (CV), according to travel accommodation website City-of-Hotels. Depending on location, the hotel may also offer additional designations that include garden view (GV), pool view (PV), beach front (BF) and water view (WV).

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Greeting Guests

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

First  impressions  last  a  life  time,  or  at  least  until  the guests check out, so it is important to make a goodfirst impression. Greeting them in English or native language is preferable. There are numerous expressions that can be used when first greeting hotel guests. Some are very formal  and  appropriate  for  greeting  guests  and  some are more informal and should only be used with friends or  co-workers.  Obviously,  employees  of  the  hotel industry  should  use  the  more  formal  expressions, however  the  less  formal  expressions  will  also  be

presented to give learners a well balanced repertoire to choose from.

## Eight simple rules for welcoming guests:

- 1. Smile when you greet the guest
- 2. Listen to what the guest is saying
- 3. Make eye contact, but don't stare
- 4. Make sure you look interested
- 5. Address the guest by name
- 6. Don't interrupt the guest
- 7. Keep a reasonable distance from the guest, not too close and not too far
- 8. Always thank the guest when appropriate

## Decide which of these rules are in the 'always' section, and which are in the 'never'section:

- 1. Be loyal to the organization.
- 2. Respect the buildings and equipment where you work.
- 3. Criticize the organization to, or in front of, guests.
- 4. Be friendly and courteous with both colleagues and guests.
- 5. Argue or swear in front of guests.
- 6. Lose your temper at work.
- 7. Drink alcohol at work.
- 8. Separate your private and professional life as far as possible.
- 9. Respect the views of others.
- 10. Act in a way that could put anyone at risk.
- 11. Be honest and constructive.
- 12. Ask if there is anything you are unsure about.

## Co-worker Exchange Information

The front office staff interacts with all departments of the hotel, including marketing and sales, housekeeping, food and beverage, banquet, controller, maintenance, security, and human resources. These departments view the front office as a communication liaison in providing guest services. Each of the departments has a unique communication link with the front office staff.

## Housekeeping Department

Housekeeping and the front office communicate with each other about housekeeping room status, the report on the availability of the rooms for immediate guest occupancy. Housekeeping room status can be described in the following communication terms:

- Available Clean, or Ready-room is ready to be occupied
- Occupied-guest or guests are already occupying a room
- Stayover-guest will not be checking out of a room on the current day
- Dirty or On-Change-guest has checked out of the room, but the housekeeping staff has not released the room for occupancy
- Out-of-Order-room is not available for occupancy because of a mechanical malfunction

<!-- image -->

Housekeeping and the front office also communicate on the details of potential house count (a report of the number of guests registered in the hotel), security concerns, and requests for amenities (personal toiletry items such as shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash, and electrical equipment). These issues are of immediate concern to the guest as well as to supervisors in the hotel.

Reporting of room status is handled on a face-to-face basis in a hotel that does not use a property management

system (PMS). The bihourly or hourly visits of the house- keeper to the front desk clerk are a familiar scene in such a hotel. The official reporting of room status at the end of the day is accomplished with a housekeeper's room report-a report prepared by the housekeeper that lists the guest room occupancy status as vacant, occupied, or out-of-order. Sometimes even regular reporting of room status is not adequate, as guests may be anxiously awaiting the opportunity to occupy a room. On these occasions, the front desk clerk will have to telephone the floor supervisor to determine when the servicing of a room will be completed.

## HOUSEKEEPING

The housekeeper relies on the room sales projections-a weekly report prepared and distributed by the front office manager that indicates the number of departures, arrivals, walk-ins, stayovers, and no-shows-to schedule employees. Timely distribution of the room sales projections assists the executive housekeeper in planning employee personal leaves and vacation days.

The front desk also relies on housekeeping personnel to report any unusual circumstances that may indicate a violation of security for the guests. For example, if a maid or houseman notices obviously non-registered guests on a floor, a fire exit that has been propped open, or sounds of a domestic disturbance in a guest room, he or she must report these potential security violations to the front office. The front office staff, in turn, will relay the problem to the proper in-house or civil authority. The front office manager may want to direct the front desk clerks and switchboard operators to call floor supervisors on a regular basis to check activity on the guest floors.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Guest requests for additional or special amenities and guest room supplies may be initiated at the front desk. The prompt relay of requests for extra blankets, towels, soap, and shampoo to housekeeping is essential. This is hospitality at its best.

## Work Schedules, Procedures and Goals

A housekeeping supervisor is in charge of all operations related to the maintenance and upkeep of rooms used for living quarters, dining and meetings. She may supervise cleaning personnel in convention halls, educational institutions, hotels and hospitals. Her job normally requires her to inspect premises in addition to directing the activities of the staff.

<!-- image -->

Effective scheduling of her staff is one of the housekeeping supervisor's primary concerns. Making sure the appropriate staff is on duty ensures work is done properly and guests and patrons are satisfied and comfortable. Meticulous and regular inspections by the supervisor can quickly spot inefficiencies. She may correct them through better scheduling or improving the skills of her staff.

A well-trained staff is also vital to the success of a housekeeping supervisor. She is normally responsible for screening, hiring and

firing the staff. On-the-job training is usually her responsibility as well. It is commonly her job to make sure the work of each staff member meets all agreed upon standards of quality regarding orderliness and cleanliness.

In addition to staff management, the housekeeping supervisor is commonly in charge of inventory maintenance for her department. She orders cleaning supplies and arranges the repair of maintenance equipment, such as sweepers and floor polishers. If this equipment needs to be replaced, she is often required to submit the proper requisition documents to management for approval.

## Lost Luggage

Customer  feedback  plays  an  integral  part  in  determining  future system development for all modules. An active user group consisting of airlines and handling agents worldwide, meets annually to prioritize enhancements and exchange views on baggage industry trends. It is important  for  housekeeping  to  be  able  to  explain  to  the  custromer what happened to luggage or what is the procedure for retrieving it back.

## Suspicious Person

The  housekeeping  staff  must  report  any  suspicious  person  loitering

on  guest  floors  andpublic  areas  to  the  housekeeping  office.  The  housekeeping  coordinator  will  in  turn informthe floor supervisor/assistant housekeeper, the assistant manager and the security officer.

## 'Lost and Found' refers to:

- 1. a place or an office that keeps any items found inside the hotel; or
- 2. a place or an office where reports of missing items, reported by either guests or staff, are kept and followed up.
- 3. All staff should hand in items found inside the hotel premises, regardless of their value.
- 4. Most hotels assign this duty to the housekeeping department, or the Security department.
- 5. All information is recorded in the Lost and Found Logbook for prompt and easy reference in case of a guest enquires about a lost item. All items found by the guests and staff should be stored in a ventilated room and kept for three months before being releasing to the finder.
- 6. Some items, such as perishable food or drink, may be kept for a shorter period. The storage area must be secure.

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Early Check In or Check Out

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

At a hotel or similar establishment, guests are usually required to check in (also called register or sign-in), which involves providing or confirming  the  guests'  personal  information and  providing  a  signature.  The  establishment may  require  guests  to  provide  a  credit  card guarantee  to  cover  potential  costs  such  as room  service  for  the  duration  of  the  stay.  At the end of the check-in, the reception staff will provide guests with a room key.

Hotels  usually  specify  a  check-in  time  after which they expect guests to check-in. If a guest wants  to  occupy  a  hotel  room  before  the hotel's check-in time, some hotels charges for an additional day or treat it as a previous day's stay (as compared to occupying the hotel room after the check-in time). Most hotels, however, allow a grace time (typically 30-60 minutes) on request  by  a  guest,  without  any  additional charge,  if  a  guest  wishes  to  take  the  room

before the check-in time. Often hotels also has a latest check-in time if the room is not prepaid, often 6pm8pm. For the most cost-effective usage of hotel room occupancy, a guest should try to reach at about hotel's check-in time and leave or hand over the hotel room at about the hotel's check-out time, but it may not be always practical because the guest's arrival and departure time of flights or car trips may not align with the hotel check-in and check-out time and for other reasons.

The housekeeping must be prepared at all time to adopt it selfe to eary chack in or check out.

## IMPORTANCE OF HOUSEKEEPING

<!-- image -->

Comfort: Achieve the maximum efficiency possible in the care and comfort of the guests and in providing support services for the smooth running of the hotel. Every hotel spends a lot of effort in ensuring the quality of beds, mattresses, channel music, TV, air conditioner if applicable, attached bar etc. The comforts must  be  regularly  maintained  and  should  be  properly  functioning.  It  is  the  duty  of  the  housekeeping department  to  ensure  comfort  and  a  welcoming  atmosphere  to  the  guests  as  well  as  strive  to  extend courteous, reliable and satisfactory service from staffs of all departments.

<!-- image -->

Cleanliness  and  Hygiene: Ensure  a  high  standard of  cleanliness  and  general  upkeep in  all  areas. Clean and  well  maintained  areas  and  equipments  create  a favorable  impression  on  the  guest.  Hygiene  is maintained especially in the wash rooms, toilets, pool changing room, health club, etc.

## HOUSEKEEPING

<!-- image -->

Privacy: The prime concern of any guest, irrespective of whether rich or poor, common man or celebrity, is privacy. Room windows are provided with curtains. Windows could normally overlook good scenic view, away from the prying eyes of others in the hotel or outside public. Housekeeping staffs ensure the privacy of the guests and they should be trained with proper procedures to enter the room.

Safety  and  Security: Security  is  one  of  the  prime  concerns  of  a hotel guest. The housekeeping department staffs should ensure the safety and security of the guests with the help of security services.  They should  also  make  sure  that  fire fighting  equipments  and  emergency  alarms  are  functional  at  all  times.  They should also ensure peace, quiet and noise f r e e atmosphere in the area.

Décor: Creating a pleasant and classy ambience is also one of the major responsibilities…

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Remembering Important Times of Arrivals and Departures

It would be desirable for housekeepers to memorize the procedure sequence in solving everyday duties, which  would  minimize  the  preparation  time.  The  most  important  part  in  working  processes  is  the procedure, and that is why its memorizing will influence the work effectiveness.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Most memory-based  work  has  been replaced  with  digital  cloud-technology that manages  guest  traffic  details, tracks  daily  hotel  activity  and  ensures higher staff interactivity. 'Human memory  has  its  limitations.  We  may forget or lose track of important information  or  even  misplace  our  registers.

When managed digitally, all Details are secure. State of the art technology  has  made  it  a  lot  easier  to  maintain  records,  and locate and retrieve information at any time.'

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Team work

Your main team will be the individuals that you work with every day. You will share job responsibilities and help each other on a regular basis. Keep in mind that you will also step outside of your area when needed. We will  cross  area  lines  and  help  other  areas  when  they  are  swamped.  That's  the  true  test  of  a  team, helping each other when help is needed!

In  team  work,  it  is  essential  to  communicate  with  other  departments  of  the  hotel,  especially  with  the reception.  Participation  in  formal  discussions  about  business  events  is  welcome,  in  order  to  improve operations.  Housekeepers  contact  the  head  housekeeper,  who  is  responsible  for  the  supplies  and materials in the department.

Each  housekeeper  should  develop  teamwork  for  their  own  learning  and  the  exchange  of  opinions. Although each housekeeper has a number of rooms, it is likely that with some individuals it will take  longer than others, so teamwork meets the desired effects.

## Enrollment in different Recreational Programs

Many Hotels offer animation and recreation programmes for guests. This includes many sports and recreation activities, fun and games, thematic games for children, creative workshops and dance programs. Housekeeper needs to know programs offered by the hotel and with registration cards to find out which guest is enrolled in different programs.

## Formal Discussions about Work Processes

<!-- image -->

## What is Teamwork?

Well,  let's  look  at  the  real  definitionTeamwork  is  a  joint  action  by  two  or more  people  or  a  group,  in  which  each person  contributes  with  different  skills and Express his or her individual interests and  opinions  to  the  unity  and  efficiency of the group in order to achieve common goals.

This  definition  really  fits  our  hotels.    We all  share one common goal- to make our guests  stay  and  exceed  every  guest's

## BASIC SKILLS

## HOUSEKEEPING

<!-- image -->

expectations.  There is no question that in a hotel, it requires two or more people working together to accomplish our goal.  So, teamwork is a requirement of a successful hotel.

## Teamwork actions

There are many ways that our 'TEAM' takes action.  Let's look at a few examples:

Room Cleanliness our housekeepers do a great job, but sometimes they get a 'go-back'.  Our manager's work with them as a team to make sure the room is perfect for every guest.

Room Inspections the General Manager, housekeeping manager and maintenance all work together to inspect rooms.  We make sure our rooms are in working order for our guests.

Safety & Security Every employee helps with overall safety.  Be aware of your surroundings and report any issues to the Manager on Duty.

Positive Atmosphere Every team member contributes to the happiness of the staff.  We pick each other up when we are down and help out when needed.  We all depend on each other.

**Remember- we are only as strong as our weakest link.  Everyone must work together to insure a positive guest experience

## Making Suggestions on Improving Work Processes

<!-- image -->

The  hotel  industry  is  fraught  with  competition,  and  twothirds of the jobs available are service jobs, with the largest departments  being  in  housekeeping.  All  of  the  services offered  by  the  hotel  industry  can  be  duplicated  from  one location  to  another,  from  one  country  to  another. Housekeeping can  be  a  way  to  set  a  hotel  apart  from  its competitors.  In  addition,  housekeeping  establishes  a hotel's  reputation  for  cleanliness  and  quality.  It  is  vital  to have  a  strong  housekeeping  department  in  the  hotel

industry, for the guests' health, safety and comfort.

Housekeepers  are  specially  trained  individuals.  They  can  be  provided  with  performance-development programs to improve their work and assist them in moving up in the hospitality industry. Housekeeping in the hotel industry can be a stepping stone for future positions and promotions for housekeepers. These individuals learn key communication and teamwork skills that can be used throughout the hotel industry, not just in housekeeping.

Teamwork is very important because it improves morale (helps solve difficult problems) utilizes the power of the whole team.

<!-- image -->

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Informing Othere Workers

Worker consultation is enshrined in health and safety law because of its importance in preventing risks and finding effective solutions. Workplaces in which employees actively contribute to health and safety often have a lower occupational risk level and accident rates.

The main reasons why workers should actively influence management decisions include:

- worker participation helps in developing realistic and effective ways of protecting workers
- by getting involved in an issue at the planning stage, workers are more likely to identify problems and their causes, help find practical solutions, and comply with the end result
- if workers are given the opportunity to participate in shaping  safe  work  systems,  then  they  can  advise, suggest,  and  request  improvements  -  helping  to develop measures to prevent occupational accidents and ill-health in a timely and cost effective manner

<!-- image -->

- where workers are involved from an early stage they will feel commitment to the solution
- communication and motivation in general will be improved

## Use of hotel housekeeping computer applications

It  also  requires  computer  skills  to  operate  systems  that  track  billing,  reservations,  room  assignments, meetings, and special events. Computers are likewise used to order food, beverages, and supplies, and to prepare reports for hotel owners and top management.

Housekeepers  use  the  same  software  as  front  desk  staff  to  verify  which  rooms  are  checking  out  and staying over each day. That way, they know which rooms to completely clean and which ones to simply tidy. Housekeepers use the software to communicate to the front desk, letting them know which rooms are clean and available for check-ins.

Housekeeping Status Report: prepared by the housekeeping department at the end of the shift, indicates the curent housekeeping status of each room (the rooms that have been cleaned that day) - use of word processor software.

While  doing  the  routine  room  cleaning,  hotel  housekeeper  may  notice  the  specific  problems  in  the room such as faulty electrical plugs, dripping faucets, leaking pipes or malfunctioning air-conditioning units etc, and report it immediately to the maintenance person using computer application.

## HOUSEKEEPING

## Word Processing Software for Summaries Events

Using  a  computer  to  create,  edit,  and  print documents. Of all computer applications, word processing  is  the  most  common.  To  perform word  processing,  you  need  a  computer,  a special program called a word processor , and a printer.  A  word  processor  enables  you  to create a document, store it electronically on a disk,  display  it  on  a  screen,  modify  it  by entering  commands  and  characters  from  the keyboard, and print it on a printer.

The great advantage of word processing over using a typewriter is that you can make changes without retyping the entire document. If you make a typing mistake, you simply back up the  cursor and correct your mistake. If you want to delete a paragraph, you simply remove it, without leaving a trace. It is equally easy to insert a word, sentence, or paragraph in the middle of a document. Word processors also make it easy to move sections of text from one place to another within a document, or between documents. When you have made all the changes you want, you can send the fileto a printer to get a hard copy.

Word processors vary considerably, but all word processors support the following basic features:

- Insert text: Allows you to insert text anywhere in the document.
- Delete text: Allows you to erase characters, words, lines, or pagesas easily as you can cross them out on paper.
- Cut andpaste : Allows you to remove ( cut ) a section of text from one place in a document and insert ( paste ) it somewhere else.
- Copy: Allows you to duplicate a section of text.
- Page  size  and margins : Allows  you  to  define  various  page  sizes  and  margins,  and  the  word processor will automatically readjust the text so that it fits.
- Search and replace: Allows  you  to  direct  the  word  processor  to  search  for  a  particular  word  or phrase. You can also direct the word processor to  replaceone group of characters with another everywhere that the first group appears.
- Word wrap: The word processor automatically moves to the next line when you have filled one line with text, and it will readjust text if you change the margins.
- Print: Allows you to send a document to a printer to get hardcopy.
