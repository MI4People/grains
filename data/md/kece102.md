## Introduction to Hospitality Industry

Hospitality is a part of Tourism Industry, which helps in providing other services like accommodation and food to the guests. Hospitality refers to an association between the guest and the host, where the host welcomes the guest and makes sure that their stay is pleasant.

This Unit explains the basic concepts of hospitality, various types of accommodation facilities offered by Hospitality Industry and also gives a brief idea about the various Guidelines for the Classification of Hotels in India. Last two sessions of this Unit focus on front office and travel desk operations of hospitality industry.

The responsibility of the Customer Service Executive (Meet and Greet) involves making a guest feel welcome and comfortable. The CSE must have attained training in the basic aspects of hospitality starting from receiving the guests to escorting the guest to the airport. The knowledge of hospitality would empower the Executive to  provide  quality  and  standard  services  to  their customers.

to fulfil  their  needs and help in satisfying the guests; only then, the guests will take back fond memories and share their good experience back at home.

## Accommodation

Staying  arrangements  is  one  of  the  basic  needs  of tourists at the destination during their trips. It is a type of  residential  establishment  which  provide  boarding and lodging to the travellers who stay away from their homes for more than a day and are in need of lodging for sleep, rest, food, safety, shelter from cold temperatures or  rain,  storage  of  luggage  and  access  to  common household functions.

Let  us  briefly  consider  the  various  types  of accommodation  which  are  broadly  classified  into primary and secondary type.

## Primary Accommodation

ish%

## Hotel

A commercial establishment providing lodging, meals, and other guest services, is termed as hotel. Thus, a hotel is a place where a bonafide traveller can get food and accommodation where he is in a position to pay for it and is in a fit condition to be received.

Today, hotels not only provide accommodation and meals but also offer a variety of other services as per the needs of the guest. For example, many hotels offer a health club, crèche, etc.

## Types of hotels

Based on the facilities offered to the tourists, the hotels are broadly classified into the following types.

International  Hotels:  They  are  the  modern  western style hotels, found mostly in metro cities and at major tourist destinations and are located at prime locations in the city. These hotels are classified on the basis of internationally  accepted  star  grading  which  ranges from one star to five stars. The grading is given to the hotel depending on the facilities and services which the hotel provides. The facilities which are provided by the five  star  are  an  information  desk,  conference  centre,

travel  desk,  multi  cuisine  restaurants, banquet  halls,  room  service,  swimming pool, gymnasium, health clubs, shopping arcades, beauty parlours, entertainment or cultural programmes, etc.

Floating Hotels: These types of hotels are located on the surface of water such as the sea, river, or lake. These hotels have facilities which are similar to a regular hotel. For example: Houseboats of Kashmir and Kerala or old cruise liners which have been converted into a hotel.

Commercial Hotels: These hotels are located mostly near the business or commercial centres  and  mainly  serve  the  business tourists, middle income tourists and their repeat  customers.  Most  of  these  hotels are equipped with parking space, restaurants, and facilities for their business guests  such  as  convention  centres  and meeting rooms.

Heritage Hotels: These are the old properties like castles, forts, palaces, and havelis belonging to royalty which have been renovated and converted into hotels. Here, tourists enjoy the majestic grandeur and splendour of the olden days. Some examples of heritage hotels are Umaid Bhavan Palace in Jodhpur, Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, Shalini Palace in Kolhapur, Lalitha Mahal in Mysuru and Sheesh Mahal in Orchha.

## Resorts

Resort hotels are usually located in the mountains, on an island, or in some other exotic locations away from cities like sea side, hill stations, wildlife sanctuaries, etc.  These  hotels  have  recreational  and  relaxation facilities, scenery which includes indoor and outdoor games like golf, tennis, sailing, skiing and swimming, gambling, spa, etc. Resort hotels provide enjoyable and memorable guest experiences that encourage guests to repeat to the resort.

Resorts can be of various types and can be classified on the basis of climate, and topography. Broadly they are divided in the following categories:

## Mountain and Hill Resorts

In  India,  almost  all  mountainous  and hilly areas of India are dotted with places of tourist interest. In the north are the Himalayan ranges, blessed with scenic beauty  which  is  beyond  description. Besides,  there  are  high  hills  in  the

northeast and in and around the Nilgiris in the south. There are hill ranges of medium to low heights in the Western Ghats, Vindhyas, Satpuras and the Aravalis in addition to isolated hillocks elsewhere. Hill resorts are divided into following three categories according to their altitude:

- (i)  resorts at great heights (between 2,100-3,500 meters above mean sea level)
- (ii)  hill resorts at medium altitudes (between 1,200 and 2,100 meters above mean sea level)
- (iii)  hill resorts at low altitudes (between 800 and 1,200 meters above mean sea level)

## Ski or Winter Resorts

A winter or ski resort is developed in cold locations, mostly having snow for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. One can enjoy holidays in these winter resorts in India and stay in the best winter resorts that offer ultimate luxury as well as some warm cozy time with loved ones. Some examples of these are Grand Dragon  (Laddakh),  Avlan  (Mussoorie),  Solang  Valley (Manali),  Kasauli  Resort  (Kasauli)  and  Savoy  hotel (Ooty), Auli (Uttarakhand), etc.

## Beach Tourism or Sea-side Resorts

India's long coastline of over 7000 Km from Kandla in Gujarat to Kolkata in West Bengal and along the islands offers an opportunity for the promotion of beach tourism. A number of beautiful beaches of Goa and that of Kovalam in Kerala are quite popular with the

<!-- image -->

tourists. There are vast stretches of shining golden sands of beaches at Chorwad and Ahmedpur-Mandvi. The Maharashtra coast has  eight  small  beaches  from  Mumbai's famous Juhu to Murud at a distance of 220 km. Goa's 105 km long coastline has as many as 40 beaches, out of which 12 are very popular with the tourists. Karnataka's beaches are at Mangalore and Karwar. The sun-swept Marina beach in Chennai (Tamil Nadu) is the world's second longest beach. It runs for a distance of 12 km from Chennai harbour in the North to Santhome Church

in the South. Two beaches of Andhra Pradesh, namely Ramakrishna Mission and Rishi Konda are located in close proximity of Vishakhapatnam. Orissa's Gopalpur beach is surrounded by sand dunes. Besides Puri and Konark, Chandipur near Balasore is known for its 55 km recession of the tides each day at its head. Digha beach of West Bengal is situated on the shores of Bay of Bengal. With a total length of 6 km, it is one of the widest in the world amidst gently rolling sea and thick casuarinas forest on its two sides.

All-season Resorts

These are located at any places of natural scenic beauty with food services and amenities.

## Supplementary and Secondary Accommodation

Supplementary accommodation plays a very important role in the total available tourist accommodation in a country. This type of accommodation can cater to both

international  as  well  as  domestic  tourist traffic. The secondary accommodations are-

## Motel

The concept of motel, a kind of hotel with parking, originated in the USA perhaps in the year 1925 in San Luis Obispo, near Los Angeles. Since, the automobile trade was catching up, there was discovered a need for hotel for drivers and this was called

Fig. 2.5 Motel, USA

<!-- image -->

a motel by an architect developer, Arthur Heineman' (An  extract  from  the  article  Smithsonianmag.com, December  12,  2016).  Motel  was  meant  for  local motorists  and  foreign  tourists  travelling  by  road. Primarily designed to serve the needs of motorists, motels almost exclusively meet the demand for transit accommodation.  The  services  provided  by  motels include  parking,  garage  facilities,  accommodation, restaurant facilities, public catering and recreational facilities. With a view to provide the above services to the motorists, all the motels are equipped with filling stations, repair services, accessories, garages, parking  space,  elevator  service  to  the  automobile entrance, restaurants, etc. The Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, has developed the guidelines to approve motels in India so that a set standard can be established.

<!-- image -->

## Youth Hostels

Youth hostels made their first appearance in Germany in about 1900. In order to provide some sort of accommodation and services, the dormitories in the inns were equipped with cots, mattresses, sheets, and blankets.

The  youth  hostel  can  be  defined  as  a building which offers clean, moderate, and inexpensive  shelter  to  young  travellers exploring their own  country  or  other countries and travelling independently or in groups for holiday or educational purposes.

## Caravan and Camping Sites

These are very popular in some European countries as also in the United States. These are also known as open air hostels, tourist camps  or  camping  grounds.  Camping, originally  practised  by  hikers  on  foot,  is increasingly giving way to car camping. The

sites are usually located within the large cities in open spaces. Equipped to receive mobile accommodation in the form of caravans, the camping sites provide facilities for parking, tent-pitching, water, electricity, toilet, etc.

## Bed and Breakfast (B&B) Establishments or Home-stays

A Bed and Breakfast (B&B) is an intimate, independently run lodging establishment, where breakfast is included in the room rate. These are houses with rooms converted into  overnight  facilities;  this  can  have  up  to  1  to  10 guest rooms. They are also known as 'Home Stays'. The owners of the B&B usually stay on the premises and are responsible for serving breakfast to the guests.

Indian Tourism's Home Stay Scheme is a golden opportunity  for  all  those  Apartment,  Bungalow,  or Cottage owners who can provide accommodation and food  facility  to  domestic  and  international  tourists. This scheme is based on India's core philosophy and tradition, Vasudhaiva Kutumbkam. This unique and profitable  scheme  will  enable  the  property  owners  to introduce  tourists  to  the  culture,  cuisine,  customs and lifestyle of India. A home stay is similar in concept to that of a bed and breakfast establishment. Guests are either accommodated in the family home, or in separate quarters nearby. Nowadays, most home stays provide their guests with just as much comfort as a reputable hotel. There are a number of reasons why staying at a home stay can be preferable to staying in a hotel. These benefits are-distinctive and characterful accommodations, personalised service, local knowledge, home  cooked  food,  celebrating  festivals  with  local traditions, etc.

## Forest Lodges

The rest houses at sanctuaries, which fill in the shortage of accommodation at such places, are called Forest Lodges. The state concerned makes land available free of cost, provides water and electricity connections and also undertake supporting construction for staff quarters, garbage and dormitory for drivers. Their location is finalised with the concerned ministry and State Forest Department. ITDC is entrusted with the responsibility for  the  management  of  all  the  forest  lodges.  These lodges are very popular among nature tourists who love wildlife as they provide a clear view of the forests to the residents from the guest rooms. Examples of forest

## noTeS

<!-- image -->

lodges  are  Kaziranga  Wildlife  Sanctuary  in  Assam, Bharatpur Sanctuary in Rajasthan and others.

## Circuit Houses

Circuit House is the accommodation for Government officers.  There  is  one  Circuit  House  in  each  city  or  a small town in all the States of India. They may even be called as Rest Houses. The rates charged are very minimal and differ in case of an official trip or a personal stay. The rates are different for different parts of the country.

## Other Types of Accommodations

## Mansion

<!-- image -->

This type of accommodation is very popular in certain European  countries  mostly  in  Austria,  Italy  and Germany or some of the African countries. It is a type of guesthouse or B&B, where in addition to lodging and breakfast, guests are also offered lunch and dinner. Pensions are usually family-run and cost less than other accommodation options.

## Inns

Inns is a concept that was first introduced by the Roman empire. It was a place for the travellers to stay for the night, where they were provided with shelter, food and also shelter for the horses. Inns are similar to the sarai in India that was prevalent during that time.

## Chalet

As defined by the Webster's dictionary, it is 'a wooden dwelling with sloping roof' and the floor edges go beyond the structure of the building found in Switzerland and the Alpine region. They were originally used for dairy cattle during summer season but have been converted to vacation homes for ski and hiking tourists nowadays.

## Timeshare or Vacation Rentals

Another new type or segment of the hospitality industry is the timeshare hotels. These are sometimes referred to as 'Vacation-interval' hotels. Timeshare hotels are the ones in which the guests purchase the ownership

of accommodations for a specific period. These owners may also have the unit rented out by the management company that operates the hotel. In a timeshare rental, the vacation property is owned by the guest for a specific period which is same every year. During the allotted time period, the guest has access to the property. For example, if Mr. Gupta owns a two bedroom timeshare vacation home in Kerala for the last week of January, he is guaranteed a stay every year during the same time. Looking at the growth potential, The Ministry of Tourist, Government of India, has prepared guidelines for  approval  and  classification  of  time  share  resorts. They are classified in three subgroups- 3 Star, 4 Star and 5 Star.

## Capsule Hotels

These were first opened in Osaka, Japan in 1979. These hotels serve mostly the business tourists. The rooms in the capsule are lined similar to that of a 'doubledecker', or sleeping compartment of an AC 2 tier train. Common washrooms, vending machines and a lounge area are located on each floor. Facilities such as a bed, a television, flexible lighting, a box for valuables, etc., are provided in each capsule room.

## S eSSion 2: c ATegoriSATion of H oTelS

Hotels  are  classified  into  various  star  categories  on the basis of facilities, amenities and services provided by  them.  Comprehensive  guidelines  for  the  star classification are prepared by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India. The guidelines for this classification are revised from time to time.

Hotel  classification  may  vary  from  one  country  to another.  Guidelines  for  the  classification  of  hotels  in India ensure that they meet international standards in facilities and services. Although the five-star and fourstar hotels in India have been able to meet international standards, some of them do not figure anywhere on the global map.

The classification is valid for a period of five years from the date of approval of the chairman of Hotel and Restaurant  Approval  and  Classification  Committee (HRACC).

The entire list of hotels classified on the basis of star category is available on the Ministry of Tourism website which is updated time to time.

This categorisation assists the tourists in selecting the hotel they would like to stay in.

## HRACC

The Department of Tourism (Government of India) has set up a Hotel and Restaurant Approval and Classification Committee (HRACC) for awarding star categories to the hotel properties.

## Star Categorisation

Hotels are an integral part of a tourist's visit to a place. The services offered in a hotel can make or spoil a visit completely. With the aim of providing standardised,

## Heritage Hotels

Ministry  of  Tourism,  Government  of  India,  defines Heritage  Hotels  as  those  hotels  that  have  been converted  into  hotels  from  palaces,  castles,  forts, havelis, hunting lodges and residences of any size, prior to 1950. The facade, architecture features and general  construction  should  have  the  distinctive qualities and ambience in keeping with traditional ways of life of the area.  The architecture of the property to be considered for the category should not normally be  interfered  with.  Any  extension,  improvement, renovation, change in the existing structures should be done keeping in mind the traditional architectural styles and contraction techniques harmonising the new with old. In a Heritage Hotel, a visitor is offered rooms that have their own history, served traditional cuisine toned down to the requirements of international palates, is entertained by folk artists, can participate in activities that allow a glimpse into the heritage of the region, and can bask in an atmosphere that lives and breathes of the past.

## All Day Dining Restaurants

They are usually called Coffee Shop or Cafe in Hotels. They are usually big in size with many covers (seats), compared  to  other  restaurants  in  the  same  hotel. The main reason why they are called All Day Dining Restaurants is because of their hours of operation, as they are open from 7 am to 11pm, whereas in 5-star hotels, they are operational for 24 hours a day. The services  provided  by  these  vary  from  breakfast  in the morning to lunch in the afternoon and dinner in the evening.

## Fine Dining Restaurants

These restaurants are characterised by their elaborate and exclusive menu with special emphasis on the high quality of food that they serve. The emphasis being on fresh ingredients and natural flavours or on the type of

## Discotheque or Nightclub

## Banquet Halls

These are large Function Rooms which are primarily used for functions and weddings. The staffing ratio of full time staff in this section is very less as the function and wedding business can sometimes be seasonal and extra  staff  is  usually  filled  in  by  employing  part  time staff.

## Food Service Menus

A menu is a detailed list of food and beverage items that are served in a restaurant along with the prices. A carefully planned and designed menu can help in increasing the sales of the dishes.

A menu is a presentation of detailed list of food items  that  are  served  in  restaurant.  In  any  food service organisation, it is a control tool to run a food service operation. If a menu is developed with careful planning  following  the  food  trends  and  featuring menu, it can contribute in all sectors of the hotel. A well planned menu can also ensure optimal utilisation of hotel resources.

## Types of Menu

Even though menu could be offered in different ways in different food service organisations, traditionally there are two  types of food menus that are offeredÀ la carte and Table D' Hote . Other menus are usually adaptations of these of two types.

## Table d'Hote Menu (Table of the host)

A table d'hote menu may only offer one food item from each category of the menu format and therefore offers little choice. Or it can be a menu at a set price, offering  two  or  three  courses  with  no  choice.  For example, soup, main course and dessert. The word has originated from the inns of France where the

guests ate at a common table called the host's table in the sixteenth century.

Table d'hote menus are a good example of a nonselective menu. The menu is at a fixed price with set items. It can also be a cyclical menu, e.g. changing every day and rotating through the month. The guest is seated and served at a table by the waiting staff. The various kinds of table d' hote menus are:

- (a) Banquet Menu
- (b) Buffet Menu
- (c) Coffee Houses Menu
- (d) Cyclical Menu

## À La Carte Menu (According to card)

According to the Oxford Dictionary, early in the 19th century,  it  translates  into  'according  to  the  card (menu)'. A good example of a selective menu would be À la carte menu. This is a menu with all the dishes individually priced. Items on the menu are prepared and cooked to order. All items on the menu are listed at a different price and the guest is served at a table. The various kinds of table À la carte menus are:

- (a) Breakfast Menu

rev

- (b) Luncheon Menu
- (c) Dinner Menu
- (d) Room Service Menu

e

- (e) Lounge Menu

## Table Layouts for Dining

Once the type of menu is decided in the restaurant, the cutlery, crockery and glassware are set on the table. There are basically three types of table setting for dining in the restaurant of a hotel.

## Setting Table for Formal Dining

This type of table setup is required for formal events like corporate lunch or dinner, or a wedding party. The formal dining contains multiple courses and second helpings are not offered.

## number of guests (Fig. 2.14.)

## Procedures for Booking Hotel Rooms

Hotel rooms can be booked by either personal contact or through some travel agent. There are various modes of room reservation in a standard hotel.

## Mode of Reservation

These  are  the  means  by  which  a  guest  makes  the reservation of rooms in a hotel. The reservation may come from the guests directly or through any other organisation but the medium through which they reach the hotel are different. Following are some of the modes of reservation:

## Letter

It is a written request for reservation, which may have been sent through post, courier or hand delivered. It is the most common method for advance booking. Reservations made through letter, delivered through post or courier, are time consuming. Fax or Email are more efficient and fast methods used today for this purpose.

## Telephone

This  is  a  faster  way  of  getting  confirmation  and  is handled directly by the reservation staff. During the telephone conversation with the guest, the reservation assistant takes down all the necessary details on the reservation forms.

## Fax (Facsimile)

It is the most common method as it is cheaper than telephonic  conversation  and  allows  transmission  in written form, better than telex; as it allows graphic form to be transmitted over telephone lines making it more authenticated and better.

## E-Mail or Internet (Computer)

With the fast advancement of internet in the world, today most of the hotels allow reservation online on

internet through their website. Even reservations sent on E-mail are accepted.

## CRS (Central Reservation System)

There  are  many  private  service  providers  providing CRS services thus allowing direct reservation access to travel agents, clients or instant basis through their own networks. All hotels have their own CRS system .

## Duties  and  Responsibilities  of  Front  Office Assistant

## 1. Perform Check-in and Check-out Procedures

## Check-in Process

This is a critical process, since a lot of vital information is exchanged between the guest and the hotel staff during this process, irrespective of the mode of checkin process, i.e. manual or computerised. The manual process starts when a guest either walks-in (without reservation) or one with prior reservation walks into the hotel looking for desired or requested accommodation, i.e., depending upon the availability of rooms, the walkin guest is assigned a room whereas the guest with prior reservation is usually assigned the room for which he has requested.

## Check-out Process

Check-out point is the last contact that a guest will have with the property and the experience at this point will determine the kind of impression the guest will carry with him/her. In other words, if it is smooth, the guest will carry pleasant memories. Thus, to make this process more efficient and error proof, you shall divide it into three parts:

- (a) Guest vacating the room;
- (b) Guest settling the bill; and
- (c) Guest departing.

Guest vacating the room usually depends upon the hotel's check-out time. Usually the check-out time is 12 noon. Sometimes depending on the availability of the

room and the type of client, the check-out time can be extended for the guest on special request.

## 2. Welcoming and Greeting a Guest at Front Office

Front office is the visible department of a hotel where guests interact firstly, so it is important to give warm welcome  and  greeting  to  the  guest  because  the  first impression  should  be  memorable  for  a  guest.  An unwelcoming or reluctant behaviour of the Front Office Staff leaves a very bad impression on the guest and spoils the image of the hotel. This may even adversely affect the hotel's revenue since it will lose repeat customers. So, the hotel staff should extend a warm welcome to the guest and may even offer a bouquet or a teeka on the forehead, especially for customers who have travelled long way and would be tired. Offer seating, tea or coffee in the lobby area in case of little time required for preparing hotel room for the guests.

## First Impression

- · Friendly  Welcome-  'Hi,  Welcome  to  India/ Delhi/Bhopal'  or  'Good  afternoon,  Welcome

€

- to  Taj  Palace.  Is  this  your  first  time  visiting our city?'
- · Stand Up- Get off the chair and be presentable (put on ironed shirt and be well dressed)
- · Make  Eye  Contact-  Eye  contact  produces  the feelings of caring, trustworthiness and likability.
- · Smile- Do not look sad.  Instead, smile because when we smile, it creates a spark that triggers the brain's pleasure centre. That's why a smile is said to be contagious.

## Use Right Words

| 'Are you  checking                  | 'Good Morning/Afternoon,  How may I assist you?'                                               | To begin with a greeting  feels welcoming                                   |
| 'I don't know'                      | 'Please allow me to find  out this for you'                                                    | Makes the client feel  valued and respected                                 |
| 'I don't  work in that  department' | 'I'm happy to help you  find the right person  to better answer your  question'                | Shows integrity and  gives a feeling of not  being misled                   |
| 'It's our  policy'                  | 'Let me see how I can help  you with this'                                                     | Conveys the flexibility of  the services of the hotel                       |
| 'You can't do  that;                | 'Here are some alternative  suggestions for you to…'                                           | It makes the client feel  accommodating                                     |
| 'No Problem'                        | 'It's my pleasure'                                                                             | Exudes warmth and  personal touch                                           |
