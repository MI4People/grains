## ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING

The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## PREFACE

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION  :

A definition of the hotel as a business entity was presented by hotel operators during the consideration of the hotel business to authorities of the National Recovery Administration, in Washington in 1933. This definition, as formulated by Stuart McNamara was as follows :

Hotels  provide  accommodation,  meals  and  refreshments  for  irregular periods for those who may reserve their accommodation either in advance or on the premises. In broad terms, hotels provide facilities to meet the needs of the modern traveller. The dictionaries define hotel in several ways : 'a place which supplies board and lodging', 'a place for the entertainment of the travellers', 'large city house of distinction', and 'a public building'.)

The common law states that a hotel is "a place where all who conduct themselves properly, and who, being able and ready to pay for their entertainment, are received,

Hotel industry is the part of service industry, by& large hotel industry can be broadly responsible to provide food & shelter. The establishments, which offer only accommodation, are called as lodge & the properties serve food only are called as restaurants. In Australia and Canada, hotel may also refer to a pub or bar. In India, the word may also refer to a restaurant since the best restaurants were always situated next to a good hotel.

A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging, usually on a shortterm basis. The provision of basic accommodation, in times past, consisting only of a room with a bed, a cupboard, a small table and a washstand has largely been replaced by rooms with modern facilities, including en-suite bathrooms and air conditioning or climate control. Additional common features found in hotel rooms are a telephone, an alarm clock, a television, and Internet connectivity; snack foods and drinks may be supplied in a mini-bar, and facilities for making hot drinks. Larger hotels may provide a number of additional guest facilities such as a restaurant, a swimming pool or childcare, and have conference and social function services.

As being part of service industry, hotel industry has many characteristically differences between itself & other industries. Hotel businesses are open 365 days a year and twenty-four hours a day. No, we do not have to work all of them but we do tend to work longer hours than some other industries. Those on their way to senior positions in the hospitality industry and many others, for that matter, often work ten to twelve hours per day. Evenings and weekends are included in the workweek-so we have to accept that we may be working when others are enjoying free time. The hospitality industry depends heavily on shift work. Early

in your career, depending on the department, you would be likely to work one of four shifts. Supervisors and managers often begin at 8 A.M. and work until 6 or 8 P.M., there are four shifts, beginning with the morning shift, so you may be getting up as early as 6 A.M. to get to the shift starting at 7 A.M. The midshift is normally from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M.; the evening shift starts at 3 P.M. and goes on until 11 :30 P.M.; and finally there is the graveyard shift, which begins at 11 P.M. and lasts until 7 :30 A.M. well, success does not come easily.

## 1.2 HISTORY  OF  THE  HOTEL  INDUSTRY  :

The hospitality industry is the oldest commercial activities in the world, catering  to  all  needs  of  travelling  industry.  The  origin  &  development  of hospitality industry is a result of tourism industry. When a person is away from his home, he needs accommodation, which cannot be carried along with. The primitive lodging houses or inns used to cater to the needs of the traveller. Throughout the world, such establishments were known by different names like Ryokans in Japan, Coffee Houses in USA & Dharmashala/Sarai in India.

Fig. 1.1 : Ryokans in Japan

<!-- image -->

The word hotel is derived from the French word hotel (coming from hôte meaning host), which referred to a French version of a townhouse or any other building, rather than a place offering accommodation .a hotel is an establishment that provides paid accommodation & meals on a short-term basis. According to the British laws, a hotel is a place where a "bonafied" traveller can receive food and shelter provided he is in a position to pay for it and is in a fit condition to receive. The invention of currency & wheel are the two main factors that led to the emergence of hospitality activity as a commercial activity. From the modest ancient inns to present day hotel properties that provide all possible luxuries to the guest, the hotel industry has come a long way. The evolution of hospitality industry can be divided into 3 groups as :

Ancient Era : Earlier hotels or inns (as they were called as) used to provide the provision of basic accommodation, consisting only of a room with a bed, a cupboard, a small table and a washstand were run by the husband and wife team for  the  travellers.  They  also  provided  modest  wholesome  food  and  thirst quenchers like wines, alcohols, etc the basic purpose of travelling was limited to religion or survival. In olden days, people used to travel on horses & therefore there was a stable provided by the host for the horses. The entertainment and recreation  was  provided  by  the  host's  wife  or  his  children.  This  condition prevailed for several hundred years until the industrial revolution of England, which changed the purpose of travel to become business, related which was earlier mainly religious, or educational.

Grand Tour : French revolution witnessed the golden age of travel .In 1670; Richard Lassel introduced the term Grand Tour in his book named as Voyage to Italy. The tourists of the grand tour were the young wealthy tourists who could afford the multiple years abroad. The Grand Tourists were mainly

Introduction  to Hospitality Management

interested in visiting culturally important cities - Paris (France), Rome, and Venice (both in Italy) were the important destinations. Florence and Naples (both in Italy) were also popular destinations. The Grand Tourist would travel from city to city and usually spend weeks in smaller cities and up to several months in the three key cities. Paris was definitely the most popular city as French was the most common second language of the British elite, the roads to Paris were excellent and Paris was a most impressive city to the English.

As the goal of the Grand Tour was educational, upon their return to England, Tourists were supposedly ready to being the responsibilities of an aristocrat. As this tour often lasted for several years, it was a good business opportunity for the hotels in the above-mentioned cities.

## 1.3 GROWTH  OF  HOTEL  INDUSTRY  :

A country, which provides adequate accommodation facilities as per the requirements of the tourist markets, fulfils one of the basic conditions of tourism development. Tourism is largely dependent on the range and type of accommodation available at the destination. Accommodation is a core area of the tourist industry and plays a distinctive role in the development of this ever- expanding industry.

Modern Era : The industrial revolution changed face of travel from travel for religious or health reasons to pleasure and holiday travel. Hence, there was a need for quick, luxurious and clean service. By 1800 AD, the U.S.A. was the leading in the development of modern first class hotels where as European hotel operated only luxury establishments to cater only to aristocrats. The American hotels were for anyone who could pay nominal rates. This factor had a great effect on hotel industry. In 1794, City hotel building was erected in New York It is interesting to note that this was New York's' first skyscraper. At the beginning at the 20th century, the hotel industry was confronted with the challenge of serving new generation.

Throughout the nineteenth century, several luxurious hotels were built like The Palace in San Francisco (800 rooms), Sultan hotel in Jakarta (1104 rooms) & Grand Sierra Resort in Nevada (1995 rooms) & many more.

## Characteristic of the Hospitality Industry

- · Intangibility : The products of hospitality cannot be touched or seen but are experienced
- · Heterogeneity : Standardization of hospitality products is difficult
- · Perishability : As the demands keep on changing, perishability (very low shelf life) is the crucial thing.

## 1.4 TYPES OF HOTELS :

Hotels are classified on several categories, to help the prospective guest in identifying the right type of hotel according to his standard and requirement. We have divided them into following categories-

Fig. 1.3  :  Classification of Hotel

<!-- image -->

## 1.5 HOTEL GRADING SYSTEM :

Accommodation for tourist is one of the most important elements of the total tourist product. It is an individual component also as it can be sold even without selling the entire tourist package. Being an individual service product, it is intangible and often bought in advance. Thus, the tourist at the time of booking the accommodation cannot inspect or accept or reject as he is not able to see it in advance. Thus, it is necessary to book it through reliable source, which could give accurate information for both the tourists and the travel agents and thus may need supervision and control. An individual tourist operator needs to gather information about the provision of accommodation to the tourist before the tourist sets off on his journey and when the reaches his destination.

Grading separates accommodation into different categories or grades based on judgments on the amenities and facilities of a particular accommodation unit in a form, which enables the user to choose the quality of accommodation, he requires. This may refer to the physical facilities, food and other services of the establishment, various amenities provided, etc. The establishments are graded individually or collectively by way of giving those numbers, letters or symbols.

Food  services,  entertainment,  view,  room  variations  such  as  size  and additional amenities, spas and fitness centres, ease of access and location may be considered in establishing a standard.

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

The  more  common  classification  systems  include  'star'  rating,  letter grading, from 'A' to 'F', diamond or simply a 'satisfactory' or 'unsatisfactory' footnote to accommodation such as hostels and motels. Systems using terms such as Deluxe/ Luxury, First Class/ Superior, Tourist Class/ Standard, and Budget Class/ Economy are more widely accepted as hotel types, rather than hotel standards.

Some  countries  have  rating  by  a  single  public  standard  -  Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Hungary have laws defining the hotel rating. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland the rating is defined by the respective hotel industry association using a 5-star system the German classifications are Tourist (*), Standard (**), Comfort (***), First Class (****) and Luxury (*****) with the mark Superior to flag extras beyond the minimum defined in the standard. This system has influenced the European Hotel stars rating system.

In France, the rating is defined by the public tourist board of the department using a four star system (plus "L" for Luxus) which has changed to a 5- Star system from 2009 on. In South Africa and Namibia, the Tourist Grading Council of South Africa has strict rules for a hotel types granting up to 5 stars.

- Hotels can be classified on the basis of clients or guests :
- 1. (A) True (B) False
- 2.
- All countries in Europe have same grading systems for their hotels : (A) True (B) False

## 1.6 STANDARDS  OF  HOTEL  CLASSIFICATION  :

## 1.6.1 Categorization by Star System :

This  system  is  one  of  the  most  commonly  understood,  accepted  and recognized system in India. This is also an official system of classification. In this system, hotels are classified based on facilities, which the hotels have, and services, which the hotels provide to the guests. Based on the number of services and facilities and their qualities and standards, which may vary from a basic bedroom to a luxury room with modern fittings and equipments, the hotels are awarded stars ranging from one to five stars deluxe.

The classification of new and functioning hotels is done by ministry of tourism. The department forms a committee called as hotels and restaurants approval and classification committee (HRACC hotel association of India) which is headed by ministry of tourism and comprises of members from hotel industry, travel agents association of India, and the principal of regional institute of hotel management, catering technology and applied nutrition etc. This is a permanent committee to classify hotels into five categories that is, from 1 to 5 star and into five star deluxe category. The committee inspects once in three years the existing hotels that have been classified to confirm that the hotels are sticking to the standards.

## 1.6.2 Classification based on Star Rating :

A hotel's star rating is an indicator of the quality of services rendered by the particular hotel, and is dependent on the data provided by the hotel. As star ratings do not necessarily show all the amenities& facilities or services that might

be available at a hotel, and some amenities and features may not be available in every room or at every property with a particular star rating even though the hotel gets star rating.

- · One star hotels offer clean, no-frills accommodation with minimal onsite facilities for the budget traveller for whom cost is the primary concern. On-site dining is usually not available .guestrooms generally are small, functionally decorated, and may not have a private bathroom, in-room telephone, or amenities. Public access and guest reception may not be available at all hours.
- · Two star hotels offer limited-service establishments are expected to offer clean, basic accommodation. These properties may offer some business services but generally lack meeting rooms, baggage assistance, and full fitness and recreation facilities. On-site dining is usually limited to coffee or  continental  breakfast  service.  Guestrooms  generally  offer  private bathroom, telephone, TV and limited amenities.
- · Three-star establishments place a greater emphasis on style, comfort, and personalised service. They generally feature on-site dining room service, a pool and/or gymnasium, a beauty parlour, a gift shop, and may provide baggage assistance. Meetings rooms and extended services for business travellers are usually offered. Guestrooms offer more extensive amenities and more careful attention to decor and comfort.

## The four & five star hotels are upscale establishments.

- · Four-star hotels offer a fine-dining restaurant (with multiple cuisines), lounge and room service with extended hours. Service features usually include baggage assistance, concierge service and valet parking. A conference centre with up-to-date technology and full business services are usually offered.  Public  spaces  and  guestrooms  are  thoughtfully  designed  and constructed with high-quality materials. Guestrooms generally offer stylish furnishings, high- quality bedding and bath products, and a wide array of amenities. Recreation facilities as well shopping kiosks are available.
- · A five-star hotel is the finest hotels in the world which s is characterised by luxury appointments, superlative service and the highest standards of comfort.  Five-star  hotels  offer  originality  in  architecture  and  interior design, high-grade materials in construction and décor, and such special touches as fresh flowers and plants in abundance. These properties also maintain a high staff-to-guest ratio, gourmet dining, and 24-hour room service.

internet  access  and  CD  and/or  DVD  players.  Five-star  resorts  may  offer additional recreation facilities such as tennis courts and golf-course access. Onsite SPA services, a top-notch fitness centre and a pool are generally available, as well.

## 1.6.3 Categorization by Locations :

Downtown Hotel : It is located in the heart of the city, generally within a walking distance of the business centre, shopping areas, multiplexes, theatres, public buildings, shopping malls, etc. Rates in these hotels are normally high due to their proximity of area and because the investment made of the property is comparatively  very  high,  computed  on  these  capital-intensive  hotels  are substantially high. Normally business clientele prefer such hotels.

Suburban Hotel : Located in the suburbs of the main city, it has the advantage of quieter surroundings though it does not have the advantage of location. Rates quoted are moderate to low. Such hotels are ideal for budget travellers and organizations who find the quiet setting ideal for conferences, workshops, training sessions, seminars, educational programmes, etc.

Resort Hotel : This type of hotel is located in the hills or at beaches. It is mainly patronized by vacationers. Basic facilities are provided and the rates offered are often on American plan, i.e. Room and all meals included.

Floatel : These types of hotel float on the water. Very common example is a cruise liner. In India, houseboats (peculiarity of Kashmir/Kerala) fall under this category.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Air Port Hotel : As the name suggests, these hotels are situated near the airport and are ideal for transit guests who are in the city only a few hours. It is not possible for them to stay in a downtown hotel. Rates are on European plan, i.e. Charges for room only.

Motels : This term is derived from the phrase, "motor hotels", which are located principally on highways. They provide modest board and lodging to highway travellers. The length of stay is usually overnight, thus rates quoted are on European plan, i.e. Room only.

<!-- image -->

## 1.6.4 Categorization by number of rooms :

The capacity of a hotel in terms of the number of rooms is a yardstick for the categorization of the hotel by "size".

- · Hotels with 25 rooms and less may be termed "small" in India but in the western countries hotels which have less than 100 rooms are considered as small.
- · Those with 25 to 100 may be called "medium" in India but in the western countries hotels which have less than 300 rooms are considered as medium. Those with 101 to 300 are called "large" in India but in the western countries, hotels, which have less than 600 rooms, are considered as large.
- · Hotels with over 300 rooms which are very common these days, may be termed "very" large & in India but in the western countries hotels which have rooms in the range of 600 to1000 are considered as very large;.

## 1.6.5 Categorization by Type of Plan :

Hotels are categorized according to the type of plan, they offer. We thus have hotels on European plan(room only),continental plan(room +continental breakfast) American plan (room rate+ breakfast+ lunch+ dinner) or modified American plan(room+ breakfast+ lunch/dinner).these plans are decided by the hotel on a variety of factors including type of clientele, length of stay and average customer preference

## 1.6.6 Categorization by type of clientele :

We often hear in hotel parlance, the terms such a group hotel, commercial or business hotel, family hotel, etc. This categorization is based on the type of patronage.

- · Group hotels cater to groups and thus their rates would be on American plan (where the rate includes tariff, breakfast, lunch & dinner).
- · Commercial hotels cater to mostly businesspersons and are on European plan (where the rate is for the accommodation only) or continental plan (where the rate includes accommodation & the charges for breakfast).
- · A  family  hotel  would  be  on  American  plan.  Where  all  three  meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) are included in the room rate. Such hotels are normally situated in resort cities.

The  Hotel  Industry

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

- · Convention/conference hotel : convention is a formal assembly of members for acceptance of certain practices. A conference is a meeting of common interest participants. Such hotels need to be at least large as generally the outstation participants are accommodated in the same hotel. Such hotels should have all the facilities like overhead projector, DVD player, television etc as well should have banqueting facility to cater the participants.

## 1.6.7 Categorization by length of guest stay :

This categorization of hotels can be further divided into three sub-groups :

- · Transient hotels where a guest can stay for a day or even for few hours (airport hotels could be termed thus);
- · Residential hotels where guests stay for a minimum period of one month the hotel signs a detailed lease with me customer;
- · Semi-residential hotels, which incorporate the features of both the transient and residential hotels.

## 1.6.8 Categorization by Ownership :

- · Proprietary  ownership  : small properties are owned by one person & operated by his family members whereas large properties are owned by international hotel chains like Hyatt, J.W. Marriot etc .As well as national chains like Cambay, Choice hotels etc.
- · Time-share : where the buyers can occupy the properties (of the company) for a stipulated days, every year for which they make onetime payment. E.g., club Mahindra holiday, country club etc.
- · Management contract : there are entrepreneurs who have finance but do not  have  the  expertise  to  manage  a  hotel  make  a  contract  with  the companies, which have such expertise. E.g. Hilton, Starwood hotels etc.
- · Franchise : the franchisor (who owns the trademark, product) allows the franchisee (who gets the right to do the business under the franchisor's name) to do the business which is mutually beneficial to both .e.g. Ramada Inn, Best Western etc.

## 1.7 CHANGING  PROFILES  OF  HOTEL  INDUSTRY  :

- · The developments in tourism and transportation,
- · Increasing  demand  among  tourists  due  to  the  improvement  in  living standards and economic conditions has also changed the profile of the accommodation sector.
- · Changing social pattern from joint family to nuclear family
- · The tendency among middle-income groups to take holiday at any time of the year has encouraged accommodation operators to offer novel kinds of arrangements, which are now available in addition to traditional season time for hospitality sector.
- · New types of accommodation, particularly holiday villages that are more suitable for family type tourists, condominiums and apartment houses, camper vans, time-share hotels private villas and camping facilities, have proved very successful and to a certain degree are replacing traditional hotels and boarding houses.
- · Change in attitude of the senior citizens who have funds & time available.
- · These  changes  reflect  changes  in  demand  with  new,  often-younger groups(mostly honeymooners)& senior citizens entering the international travel market( including faraway countries & cruises)which was earlier restricted to neighbouring countries only, and also new approaches to the problem of providing enough facilities in a very competitive industry with a highly seasonal demand.

All the above factors seem to have influenced the structure of the hotel industry as a whole.

According to the study conducted by WTO (World Tourism Organization), the future developments in the accommodation sector are as follows :

A significant growth in accommodation supply will continue to be contributed by  Hotel  chain  operators  (both  national  &  international),  and  airlines.  This expansion  will  result  mainly  from  the  further  development  of  management contracts and franchise agreements. There will be a continuing move towards the further  diversification  of  accommodation.  The  development  of  budget accommodation,  covering  budget  hotels  and  supplementary  means  of accommodation, is likely to continue as mass tourism stimulates new demands for competitively priced accommodation. The standard of accommodation will continue to rise. Demand for recreational and sporting facilities will increase in both business and leisure accommodation. Rising building and operating costs, growing environment and conservation pressures, as well as the need to keep staffing  levels  at  a  minimum,  will  influence  design  and  construction  of accommodation units.

## 1.10 HERITAGE  HOTELS  IN  INDIA  :

Heritage hotel chains in India are those hotels, which at some point of time in history were fortresses, and castles that were home to the rulers of India. For centuries, the ancient fortress, the defensive castle or the composite haveli was the abode of royalty and the nobility where hospitality was an integral part of life in Rajasthan. These Heritage hotels are a special treat to the visitors, as those who run or maintain these hotels have made sure that the traditional work, carvings, décor and the style of hospitality remain as it were in the olden times of India. As already mentioned, these heritage hotels were home to the rulers; therefore, it is but natural that the architecture and décor of these palaces are lavish. Some of these heritage homes are reflective of Rajputana and Mughal architecture. The architecture of these royal buildings was such that there were separate  viewing  galleries  for  the  women  of  these  households.  There  were separate wings constructed for the men, women, guests and the servants of the household.

Over the centuries it has been the custom of these heritage homes in India, to provide hospitality to every person who visited these homes, now that most of these homes have been transformed into hotels, the owners Endeavour to maintain the traditional concept of extending a warm and hospitable atmosphere to each and every individual who visits these hotels in India.

After the year 1947, that is in the post independence period the Government of  India  abolished  royal  titles  and  the  concept  of  feudal  lords  and  feudal ownership of lands in India. The Government of India withdrew the Privy Purse and special privileges to the royalty. Consequently, members of most of the royal

families found it extremely difficult to maintain these huge buildings in India. These large mansions lay almost abandoned or unattended till a few enterprising people realized that perhaps the only way to maintain these historic homes was their  appropriate  reuse.  In  addition,  the  large  palaces  of  the  Maharajas  set precedent by becoming five star luxury hotels. Later some of the heritage homes followed suit and are now functioning as luxury heritage hotels all over India.

## 3.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations  for  any  purpose  and  any  duration,  with  or  without  any  means  of transport. Travel also includes relatively short stays between successive movements. Movements between locations requiring only a few minutes are not considered

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

as travel. As an activity, "travel" also covers all the activities performed during a travel (movement).Travel can be for recreational purposes, for tourism, to visit people, for business or for commuting, and may occur for numerous other reasons, such as to obtain health care, migration, fleeing war, etc. Travel may occur by human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling, or with vehicles, such as airplanes, private transport, public transport, automobiles and trains.

Even though both, travel & tourism involve movement of people from one place to another, tourism is wider term as compared to travel. As travel only deals with the movement & as well all the arrangements for that journeying ticketing for the journey, meals during the journey. Tourism includes all the arrangements for the entire experience. Travel ends at the destination, where as tourism does not. Tourism includes travel, accommodation at the destination, meals arrangement; sightseeing, shopping, recreational activities etc. are together called as tourism.

The  United  Nations  classified  three  forms  of  tourism  in  1994  in  its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics : Domestic tourism, which involves residents  of  the  given  country  travelling  only  within  this  country;  Inbound tourism, involving non-residents travelling in the given country; and Outbound tourism, involving residents travelling in another country.

Recently, the tourism industry has shifted from the promotion of inbound tourism to the promotion of intra bound tourism because many countries are experiencing tough competition for inbound tourists. Some national policymakers have shifted their priority to the promotion of intra bound tourism to contribute to the local economy. Examples of such campaigns include "See America" in the United  States,  "Malaysia  Truly  Asia"  in  Malaysia,  "Get  Going  Canada"  in Canada, "Wow Philippines" in the Philippines, "Uniquely Singapore" in Singapore, "100% Pure New Zealand" in New Zealand and "Incredible India" in India.

Thus  we  can  say  that  Tourism  is  the  complex  phenomenon,  which comprises of the basic idea of shifting a traveller or a group of tourists, from one place to another, feeding them, making accommodation available, making various opportunities of entertainment available {either active or passive participation}, and returning them back to their homes.

## 3.2 DEFINITION  OF  TOURISM  :

Tourism is a dynamic, evolving, consumer -driven force and is the world's largest  industry  if  all  of  its  interrelated  components  are  placed  under  one umbrella, travel, lodging, foodservice and recreation. The word tourism did not appear in the English language until the early nineteenth century. The word tour was more closely associated with the idea of a voyage or perhaps a theatrical tour than with the idea of an individual "travelling for pleasure purposes, which is the accepted use of the word today". The World Tourism Organization's definition of tourism is "Tourism comprises the activities of persons travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes."

Hunziker and Krapf, in 1941, defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity In 1976 the Tourism Society of England defined it as "Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destination outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each

destination.  It  includes  movements  for  all  purposes."  In  1981,  International Association  of  Scientific  Experts  in  Tourism  defined  Tourism  in  terms  of particular  activities  selected  by  choice  and  undertaken  outside  the  home environment.

Tourism means different things to different people. For example, a hotelier might say that tourism is wonderful because it brings guests who fill rooms and restaurants. However, a government official might define it as the economic benefit of more money coming into the country, state or city. Whereas fir the host it might be nuisance to his peaceful life.

A tourist, by United Nations (U.N.) definition, is 'a person who stays for more than one night and less than a year'. Business and convention travel is included in this definition.

## 3.3 HISTORY  OF  TOURISM  :

The invention of money by the Sumerians (Babylonians) and the development of trade beginning about 4000BC marked the beginnings of the modern era of travel. Not only were the Sumerians the first to grasp the idea of money and use it in business transactions, but they were also the first to invent cuneiform writing and the wheel, also they should be credited as the founders of the travel business. Five thousand years ago, cruises were organised and conducted from Egypt. Probably the first journey ever made for purposes of peace and tourism, was made by Queen Hatshepsut to the lands of Punt in 1480BC. Beginning in 2700BC the pharaohs began to take advantage of the abundance of good building stone in the Nile valley to build their elaborate burial tombs.

The earliest forms of leisure tourism can be traced as far back as the Babylonian and Egyptian empires. A museum of "historic antiquities" was open to the public in the sixth century BC in Babylon, while the Egyptians held many religious festivals attracting not only the devout, but also many who came to see the famous buildings and works of art in the cities. The local towns accommodated tourists by providing services such as : vendors of food and drink, guides, hawkers of souvenirs& touts.

From around the same date, Greek tourists travelled to visit the sites of healing gods. Because the independent city-states of ancient Greece had no central authority to order the construction of roads, most of these tourists travelled by water, hence seaports prospered.

The lands of the Mediterranean Sea produced a remarkable evolution in travel. People travel for trade, commerce, religious purposes, festivals, medical treatment, or education developed at an early date.

Domestic tourism also flourished within the Roman Empire. Second homes were built by the wealthy within easy travelling distance of Rome, occupied

particularly during the springtime social season. Naples attracted the retired and the intellectuals.

From the early seventeenth century, a new form of tourism developed as a  direct  outcome  of  the  freedom  and  quest  for  learning  heralded  by  the Renaissance. Young men who wanted positions at court were encouraged to travel to the Continent to finish their education. Others soon adopted this practice in the upper echelons of society, and it soon became customary for the education of a gentleman to be completed by a "Grand tour" of major cultural centres of Europe, accompanied by a tutor and often-lasting three years or more. The appeal soon became social, and leisure seeking young men travelled, predominantly to France and Italy, to enjoy the rival cultures and social life of cities such as Paris, Venice or Florence.

## 3.4 FORMS  OF  TOURISM  :

Tourism can be classified on the basic reason for travel. Following are few examples

- 1. Medical tourism (also called medical travel, health tourism or global healthcare) is a term initially coined by travel agencies and the mass media to describe the rapidly growing practice of travelling across international borders to obtain health care. It also refers pejoratively to the practice of healthcare providers travelling internationally to deliver healthcare.

<!-- image -->

Over 50 countries have identified medical tourism as a national industry. However, accreditation and other measures of quality vary widely across the globe, and there are risks and ethical issues that make this method of accessing medical care controversial. In addition, some destinations may become hazardous or even dangerous for medical tourists. Medical tourists can come from anywhere in the First World, including Europe, the Middle East, Japan, the United States, and Canada. This is because of their large populations, comparatively high wealth, the high expense of health care or lack of health care options locally, and increasingly high expectations of their populations with respect to health care.

- 2. Agri-Tourism, as it is defined most broadly, involves any agriculturally based operation or activity that brings visitors to a farm or ranch. AgriTourism  has  different  definitions  in  different  parts  of  the  world,  and sometimes refers specifically to farm stays, as in Italy. Elsewhere, agritourism includes a wide variety of activities, including buying produce direct from a farm stand, navigating a corn maze, picking fruit, feeding animals, or staying at a Bed Breakfast on a farm. Agri-Tourism is a form

of niche tourism that is considered a growth industry in many parts of the world, including Australia, Canada, the United States and the Philippines. Agri-Tourism overlaps with geo-tourism, ecotourism and culinary tourism.

- 3. Wildlife Tourism can be an  eco  and  animal friendly tourism, usually showing animals in their natural habitat. Wildlife tourism, in its simplest sense, is watching wild

animals in their natural habitat. Wildlife tourism is an important part of the tourism industries in many countries including many African and South American countries, Australia, India, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia and Maldives among many. It has experienced a dramatic and rapid growth in recent years worldwide and is closely aligned to eco-tourism and sustainabletourism.

- 4. Sports  Tourism refers  to  travel  for  the  sake  of  either  viewing,  or participating in a sporting event staying apart from their usual environment. It includes the players, the audience as well as the persons from media, commentator etc.

## 3.7 SERVING  INBOUND  TOURIST  :

The inbound tourism market includes people from other countries. Agents who provide services for these travellers are known as Inbound Tour Operators.

During the years of the weak dollar, its decreased value meant higher costs for Americans interested in travelling abroad. This brought an increase in the number of Americans who purchased domestic vacation packages and a decrease in U.S. citizen departures from this country. Americans chose to explore their own land.

At the same time, the decreased dollar value brought a new image of America as a bargain destination for overseas travellers because hotels, restaurants, goods and entertainment often cost less in the United States than many places abroad. Many people from other countries who wanted to visit the United States considered it a good value. There is no guarantee that such trends will continue. The worldwide economic climate plays an important role in tourism and travel patterns have a habit of changing.

## 3.7.1 Serving the Inbound Market :

It may be an opportune time for the aspiring agent to become one of the many agents who are taking advantage of growing opportunities in the recently recognized  inbound  market.  Inbound  Tour  Operators  can  serve  the  inbound market in four ways :

- 1. Walk-in Business : Walk-in tourists are the ones who have not reserved any services through the same agent, but are now approaching for some kind of assistance. Offer services for visitors who happen to be in the area, such as providing maps and brochures on points of interest in the area. Foreign visitors welcome assistance with language and currency problems.
- 2. Retailer-Made Itineraries : Develop special packages for groups on a demand basis. It is the largest market area for retailers. As a wholesaler, the travel agent can offer different packages for his retailers.
- 3. Package Tours : Develop tours of regional points of interest that can be included in larger tours put together by big operators. Working along with the big operators, the inbound tourist operator can give a package for the tour,  which  can  be  combined,  with  the  packages  offered  by  big  tour operators.
- 4. Full-service Ground Operator : A full-service ground operator who handles foreign inbound clients needs following infrastructural requirements as :
- · A large capital investment,
- · A multilingual staff
- · Bank accounts in foreign countries
- · Tariffs and brochures of different domestic tours considering variety of interest E. G. Buddhist circuit, char dham yatra, golden triangle tour etc.

Fig. 3.1  :  Buddhist  Circuit

In addition, currency exchanges capabilities.

This complicated field is recommended for the experienced retailer only. However, in small cities a retailer could function as a regional ground operator who makes all the local arrangements.

Travel  agents  are  beginning  to  recognize  the  importance  of  offering services to incoming tourists as part of developing a full product line. They are providing a wide range of well-designed packaged and escorted programmes and are putting together "big ticket" fully structured independent itineraries. Such products can be promoted as domestic trips for local passengers as well as trips for inbound visitors from abroad.

When handling domestic inbound traffic, the functions of operator and packager are combined. Having total control, the operator/packager also assumes all of the risks. However, when handling international tour programmes, the roles of operator and packager are separate. An international tour packager develops the itinerary and specifications as per the need of the group/ FIT and then arranges for an Inbound Tour Operator to coordinate the services, following the packager's guidelines. The packager is responsible for all aspects (like travel, accommodation, meals, sightseeing, shopping arrangements) except operations and so, the packager, not the operator, assumes all the risks.

Before getting into the inbound market, one needs to weigh carefully the advantages and disadvantages of becoming involved in this field. It is definitely not for everyone.

##  Advantages :

- · Great potential for growth. One can start small and grow with market as opportunity arises.
- · Profitable addition to diversify product line. one can become less dependent on the just the marketing of airline tickets.
- · Business may benefit by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
- · Interesting change from old routines.

## The  Tourism  Sector

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

- · Foreign inbound travel can help offset times when domestic travel volume is slack.
- · Possibility of making contacts with overseas wholesalers and retailers when handling foreign inbound travel-to improve level of service available for outbound clients.

##  Disadvantages/Limitations :

- · Initial unprofitable period will require good financial resources.
- · Need to practically realm the travel business-one will be working from the other direction.
- · Need good travel contacts or promotional resources.
- · Requires great attention to detail when making all the complicated groundlevel plans; and requires attending to the needs of individuals within large groups.
- · Languages and cultural difficulties when handling foreign inbound travellers.
- · With foreign groups especially, staff must be available seven days a week, eighteen hours a day.
- · Need to be adaptable; a sudden snow storm, late plane or slow bus can throw everything off. Employees must be capable of making alternative arrangements/ itineraries.

## 3.7.2 Getting Started :

There are ways of getting into the field that will increase the chances of developing a successful business operation.

- · First, it is essential that one gets into the field slowly, taking each step carefully and learning the business's on field.
- · Second, decide on a target market. one will be more successful developing services  for  a  specific  market  than  trying  to  compete  with  large  tour operators. What kinds of visitors come to your area ? Does your city have direct flights from overseas ? Decide whether your target market will be ethnic, business, groups or special interest tourists. At the beginning, the market should probably be domestic leisure or convention clients.
- · Third, study the resources of the local or regional area that are or would be of special interest to visitors and identify unfilled needs. Are you in a popular vacation or convention destination area ? What are the underused attractions in your area ?
- · Fourth, develop the services you plan to offer. It pays to have some kind of specialty and to make your product appealing to your target market. You could  offer  more  personalized  service,  intimate  knowledge  transfer, accommodations, sight-seeing and you could sell options on the spot to give clients maximum flexibility.

## 3.7.3 Examples of Services to Offer :

- · Assemble complete land packages in your area. For example, a five-day tour leaving from Delhi that shows off Golden Triangle, (Delhi-India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Rajghat, Birla Mandir etc, Agra-TajMahal, Agra Fort, Jama  Masjid  etc,  Jaipur-City  Palace,  HawaMahal,  Jantar  Mantar  etc) Included would be transportation, lodging and perhaps dining, sightseeing, shopping, cultural performances etc.

- · Arrange complete land packages for special-interest groups. For example, a package including transfers, hotel, lift tickets and cocktail reception for a group of forty or more at a ski area of Auli(Uttarakhand)
- · Arrange mini vacations at unique destinations that could be reached within a couple of hours from your area with appeal to different tastes and thus to different clients. For example, leaving from Chicago you could arrange a weekend in Milwaukee to cover that city's highlights or a midweek sojourn (temporary stay) to Turkey Run State Park, a primitive Indiana state park famous for its canoe waters.
- · Set up tour activities for special occasions, such as the Olympics /World Automobile Fair.
- · Set up tour activities for seasonal interest, such as Tulip (a kind of a flower) time in Netherland

## Set up pre and post-convention sightseeing tours.

- · Have an agreement with a local bus company to handle group sight-seeing and transfers.
- · Include ethnic appeal through contacts with local museums, restaurants and ethnic associations& cultural performers
- · Provide a twenty-four hour hotline for clients who have problems on the road. (This is best suited to large companies.)
- · Offer to give foreign travellers a cultural view of India. Many want to see temples, enjoy Indian Cuisine & attend cultural performance.
- · Give foreigners the chance to meet the locals. A foreign group may want to visit a local service club, (such as Rotary), professional society or cultural group.
- · Talk with tour operators in such cities as London and Rome, to put together packages for forty or more participants.

## 3.7.4 Resources :

## Once you have decided on the services you will offer, evaluate

- · Your financial resources, building on your current business base. Do you have  the  capital  to  carry  your  business  through  an  early  unprofitable period ? If not, will you be able to get the necessary financing ?

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

- · Is your staff experienced and qualified to handle inbound travel ? You may need to hire part-time guides; if you intend to serve the non English speaking inbound traveller, you will have to have access to multilingual or at least bilingual guides.
- · You must develop a good working relationship with the suppliers you will be dealing with : local bus companies, hotels, restaurants, resorts, guides, escorts and so forth. Get to know your supplier well. The quality of service they provide will greatly affect your reputation as a reception operator. Visit the facilities and attractions you will be offering. If you know exactly what is involved, you will be better prepared to handle complaints and emergencies.  To  help  avoid  misunderstandings,  always  remember  to reconfirm arrangements.

One supply area that has frequently been a problem is bus transportation. The large national companies generally give adequate service, but you usually get more consistently good service with a regional bus company. A regional company will probably have the same driver and coach for the entire tour, the driver will know the area and the charge for the service will be less.

To maintain good relationships with suppliers and keep most of your clients happy, adhere strictly to tour schedules. Foreigners especially have no conception of how large our country is. They are probably accustomed to driving short distances from city to city and country to country and so may want to accomplish too much in the time they have available. Make sure that all the itineraries you plan are practicable.

##  Legal Aspects :

- · When you begin your new business venture, make sure that
- · You have done your legal homework.
- · Check local, state and federal regulations to make sure you are operating under the appropriate authority.
- · Check to see that the vehicles are properly licensed & make sure that the driver has proper license to drive the vehicles.
- · Find out bus and van regulations.
- · Do you need a special license to pick up clients at the airport in vans ? In addition, of course, have proper insurance for your protection.

##  Pricing :

As you gain experience, you will learn how to price your services. Working with different groups and destinations will give you the background to anticipate the many contingencies, which might arise. Then you will be able to determine the mark-up necessary to make a reasonable profit.

## 3.7.5 Getting Domestic Business :

You can begin soliciting inbound business quite simply. Gear a window display or a special section of the travel agency office to the inbound trade. You could highlight tours to popular destinations in other areas that leave from your own area. Add sales appeal by making them monitors/excursions, which include as much variety as possible.

You may attract walk-in clients by keeping local maps on hand. Now that guest stations no longer give these away, they are in demand by tourists and

business travellers. Free maps will attract visitors to your agency, leading to increased travel sales. (Also, when your clients book travel to another area, you are providing a map of their destination could be a much-appreciated benefit from your agency.)

Another way to get business locally is to make courtesy calls on local hotels. Ask them to give out your business cards to their guests as referrals. The cards should be attractively printed with all necessary information; they should look professional and appealing.

However, these are only first steps. To be a successful reception operator, you will need to actively solicit inbound business from other parts of the country.

Talk with convention and state travel bureaus; approach local bus companies and hotels; contact tour packagers; go around the country to the travel shows; advertise your services. You could send brochures to travel agents in key cities install a separate telephone line and print special letterheads for the inbound part of your business. Look into the possibility of becoming affiliated with a tour operator, ground operator or another retailer.

You may also wish to talk personally with the major potential suppliers of clients, such as tour packagers. An especially effective way to do this is to meet with them in their own offices. Be sure you have a well-prepared presentation and can offer references- you need to gain their confidence.

## 3.7.6 Getting Foreign Business :

Once your domestic inbound business has become established, you may want to expand into the foreign market. Here you need to work especially hard to get business. You need to establish your business with foreign operators. Be sure to use foreign contacts you have already made through your travel business. Especially make contacts in countries, which have direct overseas flights into your area.

Preparing tailor-made itineraries for groups has always been the province of area agents. In this case, the foreign inbound tourist would usually contact a foreign retailer, who, in turn, will work through a dependable local agent.Agents who want to become reception operators should get into the market soon.

##  Tariff :

If you become an international reception operator, you will need to provide a tariff - a reference book of services that you offer - to the packagers who do the actual selling to clients. The tariff is a "pricing list" that details all offered services, who provides them and how much they cost. Your tariff can include standardized tours, all itinerary possibilities and any special features.

Since the packager has control of the sales and selects the services, your tariff" must include information for a wide-ranging group of clients. It must spell out all potential services offered in such a way that they can be combined different interests of the clients. Your services should include the following :

- · Meeting clients at the airport
- · Assist with baggage, transfers and hotel check-in
- · Arrange general or special-interest tours with bilingual guides
- · Arrange self-drive and chauffeured cars
- · Arrange for private guide and escort services

## The  Tourism  Sector

Introduction  to Hospitality Management

- · Arrange translation services
- · Provide transportation (air, train and bus tickets)
- · Provide a hospitality desk at the hotel.
- · Arrangement for currency conversion
- · Arrangements of local artists performances

Offer your tariff to packagers and local agents. Bear in mind that your tariff

should, perhaps, be printed in other languages for use in non-English- speaking countries.

## ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING

The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## PREFACE

We have put in lots of hard work to make this book as userfriendly as possible, but we have not sacrificed quality. Experts were involved in preparing the materials. However, concepts are explained in easy language for you. We  have included many tables and examples for easy understanding.

We sincerely hope this book will help you in every way you expect. All the best for your studies from our team!

## THE INDIAN TOURISM SCENARIO

## Block Introduction :

Tourism has become a popular global leisure activity. In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide, representing a growth of 6.6% when compared to 2009. International tourism receipts grew to US$919 billion (€ 693 billion) in 2010, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 4.7%. As a result of the late-2000s recession, international travel demand suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007. This negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists' arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.

Tourism and travel-related services includes services provided by hotels and restaurants (including catering), travel agencies and tour operator services, tourist guide services and other related services.

One of the most crucial aspects of international tourism is the cross-border movement of consumers. This permits even unskilled workers in remote areas to become services exporters - for instance, by selling craft items, performing in cultural shows, or working in a tourismlodge.

International Tourism Organization plays a role in promoting the development of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism, paying particular attention to the interests of developing countries. There are some official and non-official organizations, working for the tourism sector.

In addition to major segments of the travel industry, there are many other types of travel-related businesses, which have close relation with travel and tourism. The most important of them are :

- 1. Food and beverage businesses,
- 2. Travel insurance packages, and
- 3. Sports Operators

## 1.2.1 Food and Beverage Business :

Food and beverage is one of the largest industries. Millions of people are served each year by family restaurants, fast-food outlets, and hotel dining rooms. Many food and beverages depend on tourism, especially in resort areas. Travel agents are often called on to recommend restaurants but except for package tours that include food and beverages, do not receive commissions from restaurant bookings. However, a hotel concierge in a luxury hotel may receive commissions, referral fees, and gratuities for arranging restaurant reservations. Restaurant may be divided into five main categories, as given below :

- · Classical Restaurants
- · Occasional Restaurants
- · Specialty Restaurants
- · Family Style Restaurants
- · Fast - Food Outlets.
- · Flight Catering
- · Occasional Catering

Classical Restaurants : This group of restaurants emphasize gourmetstyle cuisine and are operated into European tradition. Classical restaurants have highly skilled chefs, most of whom have spent their entire life-times mastering the art of preparing fine meals. Many such establishments also have wine callers stocked with fine vintage wines. Another characteristic feature of the classical restaurant is elegant surroundings and a well-trained highly efficient staff.

Occasional Restaurants : These restaurants may be formal or informal, with a well-disciplined menu and moderate to high prices. The interior may be decorated like a fine diningroom, dressing room, or living room. Traditional, family  style  meals  and  an  emphasis  on  'atmosphere'  are  the  main  trait  of occasional restaurants.

Speciality Restaurants : This category of restaurants has a limited menu that is cantered around a theme. The most popular ethnic restaurants specialize in Italian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, German, or Swedish cuisine. Some of the examples of these restaurants are steak houses, sea-food restaurants, and health-food restaurants.

Family-Style Restaurants : This group includes coffee shops and cafeterias. A typical family-style restaurant features a consistent level of food quality and services. Creating a sense of security and appealing a large cross-section of the dinning public. The menu may be either limited or diversified, but prices and services are usually moderate.

Fast-Food Outlets : Typical fast-food establishments are designed for efficiency and convenience, with a self-service counter, a limited menu, and competitive prices.

Flight Catering : Also known as In-flight catering involving the planning and preparation of meals and the assembly of meal trays designed to be served on board an aircraft.

## 1.2.2 Travel Insurance Package :

The main object of travel insurance is to protect travellers against monetary losses resulting from a wide range of potential travel-related problems. Travel insurance is generally sold through retail travel agencies. A client who purchases travel insurance receives a contract, called a policy, issued by the insurance company. Various types of policies are available, depending upon the client's needs, the type of trip and the prices or premium. The most common types of travel insurance are :

Trip Cancellation Policy : It ensures a traveller for non-refundable trip costs in the event that a trip is cancelled for reasons that are beyond the traveller's control.

Trip Interruption Policy : It ensures a traveller for unexpected travel costs in the event that a trip is interrupted and the client became stranded. Insurance for trip cancellation and interruption are often combined in one policy.

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

Personal Liability Insurance Policy : It ensures travellers for costs of accidental injury or property damage to the third party.

Comprehensive Insurance Policy : It ensures traveller for medical costs caused by accidents or illness during a trip, reimbursement for added expenses if a trip is cancelled or interrupted, and compensation for damage, loss, or theft of personal property.

Travel  insurance  rates  are  regulated  by  state  laws.  Premiums  for  trip protection are usually based on a set of percentage of the total trip cost. Such policies are commonly sold with package tours. Besides travel insurance, personal accident policies are also available for special categories of travellers such as adventure tourists (mountaineers, skiers, and scuba divers).

## 1.2.3 Sports Operators :

The major sport operators are boat charters and scuba dive operators. These operators pay commission to tour wholesalers and retail travel agents. They may sell their services directly to the public. Boat charters include fishing charters as well as yacht charters. Chartered fishing vessels that transport group of eight or more passengers are referred to as 'party boat'. For ocean enthusiasts, yacht charters offer an affordable alternative to an upscale cruise or deluxe lodging establishment, with additional privacy and the opportunity for independent travel. A bare-bones charter includes only the sailing vessel, whereas a crewed charter includes the services of a trained crew, including a licensed captain and a cook. The scuba diving industry is one of the fastest growing travel related industry.

The scuba diving industry embraces a diversity of components, ranging from boat charters to lodging establishments. Live abroad are small passenger vessels that operate specially cruises for scuba divers. Fully equipped for diving, a typical live board moors in remote dive destinations.

## 1.3 PASSPORT  :

A passport is a travel document issued by a national government that identifies the bearer as a national of the issuing state and requests that the bearer be permitted to enter and pass through other countries.

Passports are connected with the right of some protection abroad by the government of the country of which one is a national and with the right to enter the country of which one is a national. However, the right of protection does not arise  from  a  passport,  nor  does  the  right  to  enter.  Each  right  arises  from nationality . A passport proves the nationality of the bearer and, consequently, their right of protection and right to enter.

Passports usually contain the holder's photograph, signature, and date of birth, nationality and sometimes other means of individual identification. Many countries are in the process of developing biometric properties for their passports in order to further confirm that the person presenting the passport is the legitimate holder.

Passports are usually required for international travel, though this is not always the case; they serve only as an internationally-recognized means of identification of the traveller. This requirement may be waived (the terminology may vary in different countries) in individu.0al cases or for classes of travellers.

## 1.3.1 Types of Passports :

Ordinary or Tourist passports are the normal passports issued to most citizens  and  have  no  special  connotations.  They  are  also  known  as  normal passports.

Diplomatic passports are issued to diplomats and diplomatic representatives and other state employees according to the rules of a particular country. Having a diplomatic passport does not necessarily accord the bearer diplomatic immunity. Some countries' visa requirements may have different requirements for diplomatic and non-diplomatic passports. Occasionally they are given by states to foreign citizens with no passport of their own, often exiled VIPs who have been invited to live in that state, e.g. Constantine II of Greece travels on an Italian diplomatic passport.

Official or Service passports are issued to employees (or "Technical and Administrative Staff Members") of a government travelling for work related reasons who either do not qualify as diplomats or are not entitled to diplomatic status under the Vienna Convention.

Special  passports are  issued  to  high-ranking  state  officers  and  their dependents as a means of officially guaranteeing their exemption from visa requirements.

Alien's passports are documents issued by some countries to non-citizen residents.

A Collective passport may be issued, for example, for a school trip. All children on the trip would be covered by the group passport for the duration of the trip. A List of Travellers (LOT) is an EU variant of the collective passport that can be used for groups of school children. Visa national children may travel visa free within the EU if they are travelling on a) a list of travellers, b) in a party from a school and c) are resident in the state where the LOT was issued. In many cases these children may also travel without any further travel document.

Internal passports have been issued by some countries, as a means of controlling the movement of the population. Examples include the iqama in Saudi Arabia, the Soviet internal passport system and the hukou residency registration system used in the People's Republic of China.

Emergency or Temporary passports are issued to persons whose original passport has been lost or stolen and who need to urgently travel.

Business passports are passports with extra pages issued to frequent travellers.

Laissez-passer is a document issued by organizations such as the United Nations for their officials.

Family passports are passports that are issued to family units - parent(s) and child (ren).

## Immigration Stamps on Passports

Immigration authorities usually place immigration stamps in passports at a border crossing as part of their immigration control or customs procedures.

## Travel-Related Products

Introduction  to Hospitality Management

This  endorsement  can  serve  many  different  purposes.  In  the  United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal "leave to enter"  granted  to  a  person  subject  to  control  when  they  enter  the  country. Alternatively  the  stamps  activate  and/or  acknowledge  the  continuing  leave conferred in the individuals' entry clearance.

Other authorities, such as the Schengen system, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for 3 months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In both systems it is not allowed to stamp the passports of persons not subject to Immigration Control, for example citizens of that country (or other EU nationals within the European Union). This is because the stamping of the passport imposes a control that the person is not subject to.

This does not apply in other countries where the stamp in a passport simply acknowledges the entry and exit of a person - for example in Australia, Russia or China.

Most countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned.

The  colour  of  the  ink  or  the  style  of  stamp  may  also  provide  such information. In Hong Kong just prior to and after the 1997 transfer of sovereignty from the UK to the People's Republic of China, arrival and departure stamps were identical at all ports of entry--but only those applied at the airport are in black ink. The stamps applied at Hong Kong's sea and land border crossings were applied  in  purple  and  red  ink  respectively.  Immigration  stamps  applied  by Macau's immigration service under Portuguese administration had slightly different borders depending on whether the person arrived by land, sea or air but were all applied in the same colour of ink.

## 1.4 BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE :

Both the piece and weight systems are known as 'free baggage allowance'. If the traveller needs to take more baggage, they will have to pay an Excess Baggage Charge.The cost is calculated at between 1% and 1.5% (depending on the route) of the full economy one-way fare for each kilo of extra weight. These charges are often surprisingly high, so plan to stay within the Baggage Allowance shown on the ticket.

##  The Weight System :

The weight system is used. And the baggage allowance depends on the class of travel :

- · Economy Class 20 kg (23 kg with some airlines).
- · Business Class/Club Class 30 kg.
- · First  Class  40  kg.

These  allowances  are  shown  on  the  ticket.  For  Business  Class  you're allowed 30 kg. All luggages are weighed at check in and if the total weight is greater than the allowance, then an Excess Baggage Charge will be made.

##  The Piece System :

- · Areas where the piece system applies :
- · All flights to or from USA, Canada and Mexico.
- · All domestic flights in the UK.
- · Caribbean and some South American routes.

##  Baggage Norms around the World :

- · Weight and Number of Pieces
- · These  allowances  are  shown  on  the  ticket.  For  Business  Class  you're allowed 30 kg.
- · All luggage are weighed at check in and if the total weight is greater than the allowance.

##  Checked Baggage :

Checked baggage means items that are taken from the traveller as they check in. All airlines limit how much baggage a traveller can check in. They also limit how much baggage a traveller can carry onto the aircraft.

There are two types of allowance for checked baggage - per piece and by weight and they depend on route.

##  Hand Baggage :

Please note in light of recent increased security measures in place at UK airports the following advice regarding hand luggage is applicable :

##  Cabin Baggage :

The Department of Transport within the  UK  has  issued  revised  requirements relating to cabin baggage.

Passengers are permitted to carry ONE piece of cabin baggage through the airport security search point, which must not exceed a maximum length of 45cm, width of35 cm and a depth of 16cm (17.7" x 13.7" x 6.2" approx).

<!-- image -->

However, restrictions are still in place as to what can be carried within the baggage. No liquids of any type are permitted beyond the airport security check, other than :

Prescriptive medicines in liquid form sufficient and essential for the flight (e.g. diabetic kit) as long as verified as authentic Baby milk and liquid food (the contents of each bottle or jar must be tasted by the accompanying passenger)

Note - the definition of liquids includes gels, pastes, lotions, liquid/solid mixtures and contents of pressurized containers e.g. toothpaste, hair gel, drinks, soups, syrups, perfume, deodorant, shaving foam, aerosols etc

Also  to  help  progress  through  security  search  points  passengers  are encouraged not to include items capable of containing liquids (e.g. bottles, flasks, cans, tubes, plastic containers etc) in their cabin baggage.

All laptops and large electrical items (e.g. large hairdryer) must be removed from the bag and placed in a tray so that such items neither obscure nor are obscured by the bag.

For all US departing passengers the following restrictions apply :

- · No Liquids Or Gels Of Any Kind Will Be Permitted In Carry On Baggage. Such Items Must Be In Checked Baggage. This Includes All Beverages, Shampoo, Sun Tan Lotion, Creams, Tooth paste, hair gel and other items of similar consistency.
- · Exception : Baby formula, breast milk or juice if a baby or small child is travelling; prescription medicine with a name that matches the passenger's ticket; and insulin and essential other non-prescription medicines, which all must be presented for inspection at the checkpoint.
- · Beverages purchased in the boarding area (beyond the checkpoint) must be consumed before boarding because they will not be permitted on board the aircraft.

## 1.5 VISA :

It is a document issued by a country giving an individual permission to formally request entrance to the country during a given period and purposes and usually stamped or glued inside of a passport or sometimes issued as separate pieces of paper.

Many  countries  require  possession  of  a  valid  passport  and  visa  as  a condition of entry for foreigners, though there existent exemptions.Visas are associated with the request for permission to enter (or exit) a country and are thus, for some countries, distinct from actual formal permission for an alien to enter and remain in the country.Some countries require that their citizens and sometimes foreign travellers obtain an exit visa in order to be allowed to leave the country.

##  Conditions of Issue :

Some Visas can be granted on arrival or by prior application at the country's embassy or consulate or sometimes through a specialized travel agency with permission from the issuing country in the country of departure. If there is no embassy or consulate in one's home country, then one would have to travel to a third country (or apply by post) and try to get a visa issued there. The need or absence of need of a visa generally depends on the citizenship of the applicant, the intended duration of the stay and the activities that the applicant may wish to  undertake  in  the  country  he  visits;  these  may  delineate  different  formal categories of visas, with different issue conditions.

Some, but by no means all, countries have reciprocal visa regimes : if Country A requires citizens of Country B to have a visa to travel there, then Country B may apply reciprocity and require a visa from citizens of Country A. Likewise, if A allows B's citizens to enter without a visa, B may allow A's citizens to enter without a visa.Examples of such reciprocal visa regimes are between :

A fee may be charged for issuing a visa; these are typically also reciprocal, so if country A charges country B's citizens 50 USD for a visa, country B will often also charge the same amount for country A's visitors. The fee charged may also be at the discretion of each embassy. A similar reciprocity often applies to the duration of the visa (the period in which one is permitted to request entry of the country) and the amount of entries one can attempt with the visa. Expedited processing  of  the  visa  application  for  some  countries  will  generally  incur additional charges.

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

- · Tourist visa for a limited period of leisure travel, no business activities allowed. Some countries do not issue tourist visas. Saudi Arabia introduced tourist visas only in 2004 although it did (and still does) issue pilgrimage visas for Hajj pilgrims.
- · Business  visa for  engaging  in  commerce  in  the  country.  These  visas generally preclude permanent employment, for which a work visa would be required.
- · Temporary worker visa for approved employment in the host country. These are generally more difficult to obtain but valid for longer periods of time than a business visa. Examples of these are the United States' H1B and L-1 visas.
- · On-arrival visa granted immediately prior to entering the country, such as at an airport or border control post. This is distinct from not requiring a visa at all, as the visitor must still obtain the visa before they can even try to pass through immigration.
- · Spousal visa granted to the spouse of a resident or citizen of a given country, in order to enable the couple to settle in that country. Examples include the United Kingdom's EEA family permit.
- · Student  visa which  allows  its  holder  to  study  at  an  institution  of higherlearning in the issuing country. Students studying in Algeria, however, are issued tourist visas.
- · Working holiday visa for individuals travelling between nations offering a  working  holiday  programme,  allowing  young  people  to  undertake temporary work while travelling.
- · Diplomatic visa (sometimes official visa), is normally only available to bearers of diplomatic passports.
- · Courtesy  visa issued  to  representatives  of  foreign  governments  or international organizations who do not qualify for diplomatic status but do merit expedited, courteous treatment.
- · Journalist visa which some countries require of people in that occupation when travelling for their respective news organizations. Countries which insist on this include Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United States (I-visa) and Zimbabwe.
- · Marriage visa granted for a limited period prior to intended marriage based on a proven relationship with a citizen of the destination country. For example, a German woman who wishes to marry an American man would obtain a Fiancée Visa (also known as a K-1 visa to allow her to enter the United States).
- · Immigrant visa granted for those intending to immigrate to the issuing country. They usually are issued for a single journey as the holder will, depending on the country, later be issued a permanent resident identification card which will allow the traveller to enter to the issuing country an unlimited number of times. (For example, the United States Permanent Resident Card).
- · Special Category Visa is a type of Australian visa granted to most New Zealand citizens on arrival in Australia. New Zealand Citizens may then permanently reside in Australia under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement.

Visas can also be single-entry, which means the visa is cancelled as soon as the holder leaves the country, double-entry or multiple-entry, permitting multiple entries into the country with the same visa. Countries may also issue re- entry permits that allow temporarily leaving the country without invalidating the visa. Even a business visa will normally not allow the holder to work in the host country without an additional work permit.

Once issued, a visa will typically have to be used within a certain period of time.The validity of a visa is not the same as the authorized period of stay in theissuing country. The visa validity usually indicates when the alien can apply for entry to the country. For example, if a visa has been issued January 1st and expires March 30th and the typical authorized period of stay in a country is 90 days, then the 90-day authorized stay starts on the day the passenger reaches the country, which has to be between January 1st and March 30th. The traveller could therefore stay in the issuing country until July 1st.

Once in the country, the validity period of a visa or authorized stay can often  be  extended  for  a  fee  at  the  discretion  of  immigration  authorities. Overstaying a period of authorized stay given by the immigration officers is considered illegal immigration even if the visa validity period isn't over (i.e. for multiple entry visas) and a form of being "out of status" and the offender may be fined, prosecuted, deported or even blacklisted from entering the country again.

Entering a country without a valid visa or visa exemption may result in detention and removal (deportation or exclusion) from the country. Undertaking activities that are not authorized by the status of entry (for example, working while possessing a non-worker tourist status) can result in the individual being deemed removable, in common speech an illegal alien. Such violation is not a violation of a visa, however despite the common misuse of the phrase, but a violation of status hence the term "out of status."

Even having a visa does not guarantee entry to the host country. The border crossing authorities make the final determination to allow entry and may even cancel a visa at the border if the alien cannot demonstrate to their satisfaction that they will abide by the status their visa grants them.

Visa and immigration laws may be very different among countries. As such, aliens are advised to check with the relevant officials for visa and immigration laws governing the countries they wish to enter and eligibility to receive visas or other immigration benefits.

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION  :

International cooperation in any field of activity in the modern world has assumed  a  great  importance.  The  cooperation  brings  together  governments worldwide for negotiations in activities mutually beneficial to all of them. The growth and development of any discipline largely depends on the manner in which it associates itself with those pursuing a similar discipline. The world bodies or the international organizations provide a platform where ideas are exchanged, topics of mutual interest discussed, and solutions arrived at. The participants coming from various disciplines- arts, science, medicine, commerce, travel, to name a few-meet together and discuss areas of mutual interest. Through these discussions new ideas and information develops which helps in the growth and promotion of a discipline.

In  the  field  of  tourism,  organizations  emerged  with  the  objective  of developing and promoting the subject of tourism. The international organizations in particular have played a key role in strengthening tourism by way of combined efforts and therefore their role is of vital importance. The increasingly international character of modern tourism and the growing influence of international agencies in various fields are reflected in the growth and development of international cooperation and organization in tourism. Organizers and the providers of various tourist services whether in the government, private or public sector come together at various forums at the international level to discuss and share common problems and arrive at certain conclusions ? The providers of tourist services sometimes meet as individuals or as individual firms, but more often when their national secretarial organization is a member of a particular international body, which has been set up for general or specific purposes.

Various international organizations in the field of tourism are operating today. Some of these organizations are specifically concerned with the development and promotion of tourism at the international level while others deal with the development and promotion of tourism in a particular region. There are other international organizations, which do not concern themselves specifically with tourism, but with fields indirectly connected will tourism like airlines, travel agents and the hoteliers.

## 2.2 INTERNATIONAL  UNION  OF  OFFICIAL  TRAVEL ORGANISATION  (IUOTO)  :

In the year 1963, the importance of the work of the international organizations in the field of tourism was recognized by the United Nations Conference on International Travel and Tourism held in Rome in the year 1963. The conference recommended that "the United Nations should consider the International Union of Official Travel Organizations (IUOTO), founded in 1947, as its main instrument for the promotion of tourism". The encouragement given by the United Nations to IUOTO paved the way for greater cooperation at the international level in the field of tourism.

The growth of international tourism in the twenties and the consequent need for cooperation between the national tourist bodies, led to the holding of an international conference in 1925 called by the National Tourist Office of Holland.  Representatives  of  fourteen  countries  took  part  in  the  conference. Further conferences led to the setting up of the International Union of National Tourist Propaganda Organizations (IUNTPO) at The Hague. This body sought to promote facilitation and overcome the obstacles to free international tourist traffic; such obstacles having come about as a result of the 1914-18 World War. IUNTPO, whose general aims were more streamlined than its tide, established close contact with the Economic Committee of the Old League of Nations.

During the Second World War, IUNTPO had to discontinue its practical activities. It was with the object of contributing to post-war reconstruction that one of its members, the Travel Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, decided in the spring of 1964 to call a World Conference of National Tourist Organizations to discuss the restoration and reconstruction of travel facilitation destroyed by the war. The conference took place in London in October 1946 and the following year, in 1947, the International Union of Official Travel Organizations (IUOTO) was founded. The Organization represented over one hundred national tourist  offices  of  various  countries  as  full  members  and  about  eighty-eight

International  Tourism Organizations

Introduction  to Hospitality Management

national and international organizations, of both public and private sector, as associate members. It was at that time the only organization whose activities related to every aspect of tourism throughout the world. One of its major tasks was the stimulation and coordination of tourism development. The category of full members was restricted to national tourist organizations or other organizations set up to promote the development of tourism establishments and recognized by the  governments  of  the  countries.  The  category  of  associate  members  was confined to international or national organizations, either commercial or noncommercial,  representing  tourist  interest  or  interested  in  the  promotion  of tourism.

The  only  international  organization  IUOTO  grouped  together  the governmental or official tourist organizations of all parts of the world on the basis of one for each country and territory. The principal aim of the organization was to stimulate and increase 14 free flows of persons in the interest of economic development and to strengthen social and cultural relations. This it tried to do by way of resolving the problems arising in the field of tourist movements and in the adoption of a common policy amongst members for all questions dealing with international travel. The organization tried in various ways to develop the touristindustry in the member countries and particularly by promoting measures on a national as well as on an international level, aimed at reducing travel barriers and stimulating the movement of travellers.

##  The Organizational Set-up :

The following chart shows the various IUOTO bodies responsible for drawing up and implementing its policy :

Fig. 2.1 : Organizational Set-up

##  The General Assembly :

The General Assembly, which consisted of full and associate members, was a sovereign body of the IUOTO. It met once a year. It elected the President and the Vice President of the IUOTO, the members of the executive committee and the auditors and decided upon the applications for new membership. Laying down

the general policy of the organization and the actions to be carried out was another important function of the General Assembly.

##  The Executive Committee :

The Executive Committee consisted of eighteen full members, representing the various geographical areas. The Presidents of the Regional and Technical Commissions presided over by the President of the IUOTO and assisted by the Vice  Presidents  in  an  ex-official  capacity.  The  Executive  Committee  was responsible to the General Assembly for the direction of the affairs of the IUOTO.

##  Regional Commissions :

The following Regional Commissions were created by the IUOTO :

- 1. The Regional Travel Commission for Europe comprised of the countries of western and Eastern Europe.

The  Transport  Committee  was  responsible  for  examining  the  existing conditions  in  the  field  of  rail,  road,  sea  and  air  transportation  and suggesting better facilities and improvements. It studied and recommended measures to improve the conditions and facilities available at airports, seaports and land frontier entry points.

The Secretariat General was the principal executive body for the decisions of the Assembly and the Executive Committee as well as the Presidency. It ensured the liaison between the members of the IUOTO, carried out the studies entrusted  to  it  by  the  IUOTO  members  and  charged  with  administration.  It produced various IUOTO publications and ensured the functioning of the Tourist Documentation Centre.

IUOTO had closer cooperation with the United Nations Economic and Social  Council  (ECOSOC),  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  the International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),  the  International  Civil  Aviation Organization  (ICAO)  and  the  Inter-Governmental  Maritime  Consultative Organization (IMCO). It also had permanent links with the regional commissions of the United Nations.

The Organization was set up with the following objectives :

- 1. To promote the economic development of countries through tourism
- 2. To enhance the social and cultural role of tourism in the life of nations
- 3. To further the vital contribution of tourism to international trade
- 4. To foster the steady expansion of international tourist flow
- 5. To update members with the results of tourist market research that would help them in keeping up to date with the developments in this field
- 6. To guard the interests of tourists as well as the tourist industry
- 7. To  gain  recognition  of  the  value  of  tourism  as  a  means  of promotinginternational understanding and world peace

##  Activities :

The organization undertook various activities like monitoring and identifying trends  in  world  tourism,  studies  on  travel  demands,  market  trends,  tourist motivation, surveys of environmental effects of travel expansion and formulation of recommendations for the protection of natural and cultural resources. Other activities included acting as a clearinghouse for tourist information, keeping its members informed on tourism development and its economic and social aspects, publication of material, fostering research in the field of tourism, organizing vocational training programmes and promoting the implementation of international agreements.

The  various  activities  of  IUOTO  resulted  in  the  countries  significant achievements, some of which were undertaken jointly with other organizations. These included preparation and participation in the United Nations on Customs Facilities and Tourism (1954), initiation, preparation and participation in the United Nations Conference on International Travel and Tourism in Rome (1963) and  initiation  and  realization  of  International  Tourist  Year  (1967).  Besides establishing the Tourist Documentation Centre, the IUOTO has been responsible

for organizing various international travel research seminars and workshops. Another significant achievement of IUOTO has been the establishment of the International Centre for Advanced Tourism Studies at Turin, Italy and organization of interdepartmental specialized seminars on marketing, management, physical planning and promotion. It had also organized correspondence courses for the staff working in the field of tourism. Annual compilation and publication of official international travel statistics is yet another significant achievement of the IUOTO.

The IUOTO was the only non-governmental organization whose activities covered almost every sector of tourism throughout the world. The organization made a pioneering effort in the stimulation and coordination of tourism development at the global level. The pioneering task of the organization is now being carried out by the World Tourism Organization (WTO), which came into existence as a result of the transformation of IUOTO on January 2, 1975. World Tourism Organization was called upon to succeed IUOTO.

## 2.3 WORLD  TOURISM  ORGANIZATION  (WTO)  :

The World Tourism Organization (WTO), an inter-governmental technical body dealing with all aspects of tourism began its legal existence on January 2, 1975. It was formed owing to the transformation of IUOTO and was called upon to succeed it. The swift expansion of travel had created the need for a world body able to deal with tourism problems at the government level and this led to the transformation of IUOTO into WTO.

The headquarters of the organization were set up in Madrid (Spain) in January 1976. The activities of the organization cover all sectors of tourism on a worldwide basis. WTO works in cooperation with all international organizations, the United Nations in particular, as well as with commercial and non-commercial bodies involved in tourism. The WTO has a very emphatic technical character.

The World Tourism Organization was originally conceived as an intergovernmental organization in a UN General Assembly resolution on December 6, 1969. This resolution called for the establishment of WTO to play a "central and decisive role" in the field of tourism and to maintain effective collaboration with the appropriate organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. At Torremolinos, in June 1977, the second General Assembly of WTO approved an Agreement with the United Nations for Cooperation and Relationship. On 20th December 1977, the 32nd General Assembly of the UN approved this Agreement, which is now in force. In immediate implementation of this Agreement, the UN General Assembly in December 1977 also approved a resolution sponsored by the Philippines with 24 cosponsors, including India, requesting the WTO "to intensify its efforts to promote tourism, particularly in the developing countries, through international cooperation and to report to the General Assembly at its 33rd session on action taken".

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

The WTO became an executing agency of the UNDP in May 1976. A few months later, UNDP Resident Representatives throughout the world became WTO representatives for all matters concerning technical cooperation in the field of tourism.

##  Aims :

The aims of the organization are defined in Article 3 of the Statute, which is divided into the following three sections :

- a. The  fundamental  aim  of  the  organization  shall  be  the  promotion  and development  of  tourism  with  a  view  to  contributing  to  economic development, international understanding, peace, prosperity and universal respect for and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all  without  distinction  to  either  race,  sex,  language  or  religion.

- c. In order to establish its central role in the field of tourism the organization shall establish and maintain effective collaboration with the appropriate organs of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. In this connection, the Organization shall seek a cooperative relationship with and participation in  the  activities  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  as  a participating and executing agency.

##  Membership :

There are three categories of members of the organization. The categories

are :

- · Full Members
- · Associate Members
- · Affiliate Members

Full Members are all the sovereign states. Associate Members are the territories or groups of territories, not responsible for their external relations but whose membership is approved by the state assuming responsibility for their external  relations.  Affiliate  Members  are  international  bodies,  both  intergovernmental  and  non-governmental  concerned  with  specialized  interests intourism, as well as commercial and non-commercial bodies and associations whose activities are related to the aims of WTO or fall within its competence.

##  Activities :

The WTO performs a number of activities for its members relating to promotion and development of tourism. The major activities include the following :

- · Continual  review  of  tourism  trends  and  developments  and  exercising watchfulness over alterations in world social and economic conditions that affecting tourism, market fluctuations and maintenance of standards within the tourism sector.
- · Clearing house for all available information on international and domestic tourism including statistical data, legislation and regulations, facilities and special events.

Through its international centre for Advanced  Tourism  Studies  (CIEST),  it  provides  a  comprehensive  range  of vocational training and permanent education programmes by correspondence and residential study circles.

WTO  Functioning-WTO  functions  through  its  various  organs.  The responsibilities of these organs are well defined within the framework of the organization. The three main organs through which the WTO functions are :

- · General Assembly
- · Executive Council
- · The Secretariat

##  General Assembly :

The General Assembly is the supreme organ of the organization. It is also the sovereign body of the WTO. The General Assembly is composed of delegates representing full members, associate members and representatives of Affiliate Members. It meets every two years and may consider any question and make recommendations on any matter within the competence of WTO.

It approves the organization's general programme of work and provides general guidelines for the administration of the Organization.

##  Subsidiary Organs :

The General Assembly has created six subsidiary organs in the form of Regional Commissions. These are as follows :

- · WTO Commission for Africa (CAF)
- · WTO Commission for the Americas (CAM)
- · WTO Commission for East Asia and the Pacific (CAP)
- · WTO Commission for South Asia (CSA)
- · WTO Commission for Europe (CEU)
- · WTO Commission for Middle East (CME)

## International  Tourism Organizations

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

The task of the above six Regional Commissions of WTO set up by the General Assembly, is to implement the technical tourism recommendations of the Assembly in their respective regions. The Regional Commissions ensure the implementation  within  their  respective  regions,  of  the  decisions  and recommendations  of  the  General  Assembly  and  the  Executive  Council. Theyfunction and operate within the framework of the organization. The Regional Secretariats, which are the integral part of the WTO Secretariat, help the Regional Commissions in organizing and convening their conferences and meetings.

##  Executive Council :

The Executive Council consists of Full Members elected by the Assembly at a ratio of one member for every five Full Members of the WTO Organization with  a  view  to  achieving  fair  and  equitable  geographical  distribution.  One Associate Member selected by the Associate Members of WTO and a representative of the Committee of Affiliate Members may participate in the work of the Executive Council without a right to vote. The Executive Council's task is to take all necessary measures in consultation with the Secretary General, for implementing the resolutions of the General Assembly. Composed of twenty-one Full members selected by the Assembly and Spain in its capacity as a Privileged Member, the council meets at least twice a year.

##  Subsidiary Organs :

The  Executive  Council  has  created  subsidiary  organs.  These  are  as follows :

- · Technical Committee for Programme and Coordination (TCPC)
- · Committee on Budget and Finance (CBF)
- · Facilitation Committee
- · Environment Committee
- · Sub-Committee for the review of applications for affiliate membership
- · Sub-Committee on Statistics
- · Joint WTO-IATA Working Party

The subsidiary organs of the Council meet on a regular basis to discuss matters falling within their competence and on which they report to the coined.

##  Secretariat :

The Secretariat of the Organization consists of the Secretary General and the staff members. The Secretary General is responsible for carrying out the general policy and work programme of the organization in accordance with the directions of the General Assembly and the Executive Council. The Secretary General ensures the legal representation of the organization.

The present structure of the Secretariat comprises general management, one division  (relations,  cooperation  and  development),  three  services, (generaladministration,  finance,  conferences  and  documents),  six  sections (personnel, statistics, studies, Africa /Middle East, the Americas/Europe, East Asia and Pacific/South Asia) and four units (technical cooperation, vocational training,  public  information  and  publications,  documentation  and  technical information).

The Organization is performing extremely useful service of a concrete and creative  character  by  facilitating  the  exchange  of  technical  information,  the

making of specialized studies, the holding of special seminars adapted to world regional requirements and advanced vocational training courses. The essentially practical nature of its work programme, tailored as it is to regional requirements, takes full cognizance of the problems peculiar to countries and regions in all stages of development, such as investments, financial questions, physical planning and area development, economic analysis, marketing and market surveys-all this not only with a secretarial approach but with a comprehensive concern from the point of vim of the state.

The creation of WTO coincided with the universal recognition of tourism as an important instrument of economic and social development and its consequent ascendancy to full government responsibility. An inter-governmental body of tourism officials, such as the WTO is empowered to act in the name of their governments and speak in terms of the impact of tourism on the balance of payments. The creation of WTO thus is not only a proof that the states are fully conscious of their own responsibilities in the field of tourism, but also of the establishment of tourism to its rightful ranking at the international level.

The WTO's activities cover all sectors of tourism on a worldwide basis. It provides an international forum where tourism officials, whether governmental or non-governmental, can discuss problems and exchange ideas. Representatives of the private sector also have access to its membership. WTO works in close cooperation  with  almost  all  international  organizations,  the  United  Nations' organizations in particular, as well as with commercial and non-commercial bodies involved in tourism.

##  Finances of the Association :

The Administration and programmes of the Association are financed by way of membership dues and the marketing assessments paid by all members. The amount of dues, however, varies with the category of membership. The marketing assessments of governments and carriers are calculated in accordance with a Stanford Research Institute formula. This formula takes into account, among other things, the growth in visitor arrivals and expenditures at member areas and the growth in traffic volume of carrier members. The association's financial position is reviewed by the Board of Directors at their monthly meetings and an annual audit is made by an outside accounting agency. In addition to membership dues and the marketing assessment amounts, there are additional revenues, which come fromAllied, and Associate Members, a portion of which is applied to various marketing programmes.

## 2.5 INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (IATA) :

In  the  business  of  travel,  the  International  Air  Transport  Association (IATA), the world organization of scheduled airlines have played a key role since its inception in the year 1945. A world association of about 200 Active Members and 35 Associate Members, the International Air Transport Association was a result of the rapid expansion in the network of international airlines in the years following the Second World War. A need for the worldwide regulation of air traffic including co-coordinating international airfares and rates was felt and consequently  an  international  convention  was  called  by  President  Franklin D.Roosevelt of the United States of America at Chicago from November 1 to December 7, 1944. The Convention constituted two permanent bodies, namely,the international  Air  Transport  Association  (IATA)  and  the  International  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

However, before reaching the position that it now occupies in the field of aviation,  IATA  passed  through  several  stages,  in  parallel  with  a  spectacular development of commercial aviation. Its modest beginnings date back to 1919 when the International Air Traffic Association was founded in Hague by half a dozen European airlines that had just been created right from the beginning; they recognized the need to cooperate in setting up a network for rationalizing airlines business.

The  International  Air  Traffic  Association  expanded  steadily  with  the development of air services in the world. Among other things, it drew up the general  formula  for  tickets  and  transport  documents  adopted  in  1927.  The innovations  and  improvements  introduced  by  the  Association  progressively placed unique tools at the disposal of the industry.

In November 1944, as the World War was coming to an end, 54 states met in Chicago to lay the first foundation of the new system that would soon be needed by civil aviation. The Conference led to the creation of the International Civil Aviation Organization

(ICAO), the international body set up by government to establish universal norms for the technical regulation of civil aviation. Indirectly, this Conference

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

was  also  responsible  for  the  foundation  of  the  International  Air  Transport Association-a non-governmental body officially set up in Havana in April 1945which in practice, carried on the task assumed by the former IATA.

##  Aims :

- · To promote safe, regular and economical air transport for the benefit of the people of the world, to foster air commerce and to study the problems connected therewith
- · To provide means for collaboration among the air transport enterprises engaged directly or indirectly in international air transport service
- · To cooperate with the International Civil Aviation Organization and other international organizations

##  IATA Organization :

The  IATA  is  a  voluntary,  non-political  and  democratic  organization. Membership is automatically open to any operating company, which has been licensed to provide scheduled air service by a government eligible for membershipin ICAO. Airlines engaged directly in international operations are active members, while domestic airlines are associate members. IATA's work begins only after governments have promulgated a formal exchange of traffic and other rights (bilateral air transport agreements) and have licensed the airlines selected to perform the service. From that point on, the activity of IATA spreads through virtually every phase of air transport operations.

The basic source of authority in IATA is the annual general meeting in which all active members have an equal vote. A year-round policy direction is provided by an elected executive committee and its creative work is largely carried out by its financial, legal and technical and traffic advisory committees. Negotiations of fares and rates agreements is entrusted to the IATA Traffic Conferences with separate conferences considering passenger and cargo matters, all establishing agreements valid for periods of two years.

Members of IATA committees are nominated by individual airlines and, subject to the regulation and review of the executive committee, serve as experts on behalf of the entire industry. In the Traffic Conference, however, delegates act as representatives of their individual companies. While the executive committee fixes the terms of reference of these conferences, their decisions are subject only to the reviews of governments and cannot be altered by any other part of IATA.

The IATA administration is headed by a Director General and five Assistant Directors General. The Association has two main offices, one in Montreal and the other in Geneva. Regional Technical Directors are based in Bangkok, Geneva, London, Nairobi and Rio de Janeiro and Regional Directors (Special Assignments) in Singapore and Buenos Aires. IATA Traffic Service Offices are located in New York and Singapore. IATA's budget is financed from the dues paid by its members, largely in proportion on to the part of the total international air traffic carried by each airline. Some IATA activities are self-supporting through charges for services rendered.

A wide range of services provided by IATA includes the following :

- · The global planning of international timetables
- · The standardization of the inter-company communications and reservation system
- · The international coordination of telecommunication networks and computer systems
- · The single formula for tickets and airway bills
- · The training of travel and freight agents
- · The regulation of legal question of general concern, to develop security measures
- · The examination and solving of the problems raised by tourism, the flow of passengers and goods at the airports and to establish procedures and technical norms

##  Activities :

IATA's major purpose is to ensure that all airline traffic anywhere in the world moves with the greatest possible speed : safely, conveniently and efficiently and with the utmost economy.For the airlines, IATA provides machinery for finding joint solutions to problems beyond the resources of any single company. It has become the means by which they knit their individual routes and traffic handling. Practices into a worldwide public service system, despite differences between languages, currencies, laws and measurements. It is a pool of experience and information and the administrator of many common services and enterprises.

For governments, IATA furnishes the medium for negotiation of international rates and fares agreements. It provides the most practical way of drawing upon the experience and expertise of the airlines. It helps to carry out the fast and economical transport of international airmail and to make certain that the need of commerce and the safety and convenience of the public are served at all times.

For the public, IATA ensures high standards of efficient operation, proper business practice by airlines and their agents and the lowest possible fares and rates consistent with sound economy. Through the IATA, by one telephone call and payment in a single currency individual passengers can arrange journeys including many countries and the services of several scheduled carriers.

##  Operations :

IATA member airlines are registered in some 100 nations. Their routes cross almost every country of the world at one time or another. It is the IATA's operational task to ensure that the aircraft utilized to carry the world's passengers and goods are able to proceed with maximum safety and efficiency, under clearly defined and universally understood regulations. It is IATA's commercial objective to ensure that people, cargo and mail can move anywhere in the global network as easily as though they were on a single airline within a single country. Plainly thesetwo categories of IATA activities are closely related in their connection with the cost of airline operation, the carrier's charges to the public and the desire to keep both of these as low as possible and in keeping with safety norms.

There is a constant and progressive effort to simplify and standardize devices, procedures and documentation within the airlines themselves, among governments and manufacturers and in collaboration with other international organizations.

##  Trade Association Activities IATA Finances :

The IATA Financial Committee deals with all aspects of accounting and settlements between airlines in respect of the business they do with one another or on one another's behalf It is also concerned with many of the airlines' common

## International  Tourism Organizations

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

problems in regard to currency and exchange, taxation, charges, insurance and statistics.

Over  the  years,  IATA  has  been  able  to  reconcile  the  financial  and accounting systems developed independently in many parts of the world before airlines were extensively linked by intercontinental routes. To do so, it has developed and is continuously working to improve standard manuals of revenueaccounting practices, forms for cost reporting and for operating profit and loss and  surplus  statements  and  similar  documents  and  has  made  possible  the application of electronic data-processing techniques in accounting and other fields.

An example of IATA's financial work is the IATA Clearing House, through which the airlines settle monthly accounts for interline revenue transactions. It enables them to collect and pay their worldwide debts simultaneously by single cash settlement in either dollar or convertible sterling, regardless of the number of  national  currencies  involved.  By  offering  accounts,  the  Clearing  I-louse eliminates the necessity for cash payment of all but a small amount of the total value of monthly claims. It assures regular and timely settlements of interline debts, eliminates much correspondence and other paperwork, saves substantial foreign exchange expenses and, moreover, affords protection in the event of currency devaluations. Virtually all airlines are members of the Clearing House. Its facilities are also used for international clearance by the Airlines Clearing House, Inc., of the USA.

##  The Legal Committee :

The Legal Committee of IATA, composed of experts drawn from more than 20 airlines, is concerned with all legal matters having a bearing on international air transport. One of its main activities is the formulation of the airlines' views in the development of international conventions affecting such matters as the liability of air carriers to their customers and to other parties, the commission of offence on board aircraft, the carriage of nuclear materials and the carriage of airmail.

Another important side of the committee's work is the legal aspects of traffic documents. Since the sale of a passenger ticket or the issue of a cargo waybill creates a contract between the airline and its customer, international airline documents must be effectual under many different systems of law. The Legal Committee has prepared the legal foundation for the present system of uniform traffic documents that can be used throughout the worldwide network operated by IATA members. The relationship between airlines and travel agents, by whom such documents are frequently issued, is also within the scope of the Committee's  work  New  legal  problems  are  arising  with  the  introduction  of computer ticketing, automatic baggage handling and the use of container for the carriage of cargo

##  Technical Committee :

Cooperation of the airlines in operational and technical matters is channelled through the IATA Technical Committee, its annual technical conference and its various global and regional working groups. IATA technical activity is founded upon full exchange of information and experience among all the airlines. Out of the data, the airlines extract common requirements and observations, which guide the  standardization  and  unification  of  their  own  activities,  determine  their practical  advice  and  assistance  to  governments  and  act  as  guide  to  future

development in transport aeronautics. Policies approved are recorded in the technical manual.

IATA has played and continues to play, an important role in the drafting of the ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices, which form the accepted international pattern for the technical regulation of civil aviation, and cooperates closely with ICAO to encourage governments to implement them fully and keep them up-to-date. IATA works in much the same way with other organizations such as the International Telecommunications Union, the World Meteorological Organization and the International Organization for Standardization.

In  addition,  IATA  provides  means  for  member  airlines  to  enter  into consultation with ICAO, with individual states or with the countries comprising a particular region on the planning and implementation of air navigation facilities and services. This work is generally carried out, under the control of the Technical Committee, by global and regional working groups, which deal with new and developing problems in all technical fields of air transport operations.

The annual technical conference provides an international forum in which the airlines and related branches of transport aeronautics can discuss technical development  on  a  broader  basis.  Whereas  normal  IATA  technical  work  is concerned with the problems of integrating into airline use a particular new procedure on a device already available, the conference attempts to fix the relationship between devices, to work out the general requirements of the airlines for new equipment, devices and systems and to set up development priorities which will help airlines, governments and manufacturers, to attain their goals and maximum efficiency and economy.

There are also numerous sub-committees, which meet throughout the year. One is the Medical Advisory Committee, which deals with the physiological and psychological facts, which might affect the safety and well-being of aircrew and passengers. Its emphasis on preventive medicine has resulted in safe air travel for infants, elderly persons and the seriously ill, despite the speeds and altitudes of modern aircraft operations.

##  Traffic Conferences and Activities :

The most difficult role IATA has to operate in is the field of traffic-a term that consists of the commercial activities of the airlines. As an airline association, IATA  is  particularly  concerned  with  facilitating  interline  arrangements,  the standardization of forms, procedures, handling agreements and the like which allow quick and easy exchange of traffic between airlines. In addition to this IATA is also a quasi-public agency to which many governments have delegated the responsibility for negotiating international agreements on international rates and fares subject to their approval.

Various countries have come to terms with the fact that the huge and intricate job of negotiating detailed agreements to meet the constantly changing conditions of world air commerce should be delegated in the first instance to the IATA Conference and that these agreements should become effective only after interested governments review and approve them.

To ensure unifying its member airlines into a single commercial network, IATA has produced a series of interline agreements between them (to which many non-IATA and domestic airlines and sea carriers are parties as well), covering all phases of passenger, baggage and cargo handling, reservation codes and

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

related matters. In almost all these areas, IATA works towards adapt the forms and procedure to processing by computer and teletype.

For the public, IATA has formulated a single formula for a ticket or airway bill on international air transport that is from anywhere in spite of the geographical barriers, national boundaries, linguistic, monetary, legal, economic and other differences. Through IATA agreements, the airlines have adopt standard codes of relations with their passenger and cargo agents and consolidators, which assure the agents of fair, uniform and non-discriminatory treatment. Committees screen and special boards all agencies and scrutinize their qualifications to serve the public and the airlines.

Such arrangements are usually carried out under the leadership of the Traffic  Advisory  Committee,  expert  working  groups  and  Assistant  Director General (Traffic) and his staff. This is usually under the guidance of other standing committees. Actual application, however, comes about mainly through formal resolutions that are subject to the approval of governments. Virtually every IATA traffic action is the result of this unusually comprehensive and successful process of international agreement reached through the IATA Traffic Conferences, where decisions must be taken by unanimous vote.

The Traffic Conference process comes up from the uncharacteristic nature of air transport. Every inch of the world's surface is accessible by air and the airlines fly between most of their major cities over a maze of interrelated routes. Nevertheless, every government reserves complete control over its own share of the airspace and the right for determining what the air services levy on the public. International fares and rates and conditions which underline them must therefore be fixed by international agreements in which virtually every country has some direct or indirect concern.

For administration purposes, there are three Traffic Conference areas : No.1 for the Western Hemisphere, Greenland and the Hawaiian Islands, No. 2 for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, including Iran and No. 3 for Asia, Australia and the South Pacific. Conference business is organised within the framework of these areas, or on an inter-conference basis, but practically, the interrelation of fares and rates throughout the world makes it necessary that all of these conference sessions are held at the same time and place.

Usually, worldwide composite conference meetings are held every two years-in the autumn-to review rates and fares for passengers operations and in spring to think about matters that involve air cargo. Special meetings are called in the interval and action is taken immediately by mail vote, subject to the same rules of unanimity and government approval. The sessions of the conferences are prefaced by months of careful preparation and study, not only by continuing traffic working groups, but also by research and cost committees, which forecast the result of operation to which fares and rates are related. Preparatory work of this nature is under the direction of a Commissioner, Commercial Planning and Coordination.

The workload of the conferences has been spread since the establishment of the permanent traffic conferences committees, which deal with traffic, handling procedures and agency matters except for fares, rates and commissions. These committees  namely  the  Cargo  Agency,  Passenger  Agency,  Cargo  Traffic Reservations and Passenger Traffic -also function based on unanimous vote.

Decisions of the Traffic Conferences and their permanent committees are subject  to  review  and  approval  by  interested  governments  before  becoming effective. The conferences may accept the advice of other parts of IATA, but within their terms of reference they are responsible only to governments and thus to the public, for what they do. Enforcement of IATA resolutions is the duty of a Compliance Office, which, under the Director General, strives to ensure that members respect the obligations, which they have voluntarily assumed.

The flexible nature of the IATA traffic machinery is quite evident over the difficult years of expansion (from 1946). Not only have rates and fares been compatible on the "blue ribbon" North Atlantic routes, but they have also been effective on other major world trunk routes and on the regional feeder services in less developed areas. The trend of rates and fares has been downward and it is significant that the governments concerned have ever disapproved less than five per cent of the conference resolutions even in part. This is a substantial proof of JATNs minute concentration to the public interest. Over the years, other services have been added to the traffic organization. Among these is the Traffic Publications  Office,  which  prepares  prints  and  distributes  IATA  manuals  of conference resolutions and recommended practices, directories and handbooks, which are the tools of the international industry.

##  Tariff Coordination Activities :

The negotiation of international fares and rates for submission to various governments arises from the special nature of air transport. Airlines have their operations between major cities, which often have criss-crossing routes. For an airline, any country is accessible by air. Today governments in most countries of the world reserve control over their own airspace as also over what air carriers may charge the public for using their services. The subject of international rates and fares and the circumstances that emphasize them are the subjects wherein almost every country has some direct or indirect matter.

Tariff coordination framework of IATA is formed with the aim of providing sufficient flexibility Provision has been made for IATA members to introduce innovative passenger fares or cargo rates to respond quickly to market changes without necessarily affecting other tariff in their area of operation. Participation in  such  activity  by  IATA  member  airline  is,  however,  optional.  Airline representatives attend tariff coordination meetings as independent agents on behalf of their companies. Certain level of compromise in this case is advantageous; nevertheless,  in  the  final  analysis,  governments  may  need  resolving  major disputes that are related to cargo rates and passenger fares. Tariff coordination meetings are held worldwide as and when the members consider these necessary. These meetings are held annually.

##  Facilitation :

Another service of traffic is the facilitation section. In an industry based on speed, economy and service, red tape is a serious matter. Customs, immigration and health regulations hamper and delay the efficient transportation of passengers and cargo. Delays can add millions of dollars to the cost of operation. With international  airlines  operating  in  almost  200  countries  and  their  operations subject to the regulation requirement of numerous public authorities in every country, cooperation becomes very vi MI. Cooperation starts with the airlines themselves. A programme to cut red tape is worked out and constantly reviewed by the IATA Facilitation Advisory Committee. For operation purposes, it is

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

handed over to more than 100 airlines personnel at the headquarters of their airlines  throughout  the  world.  The  next  step  is  to  consult  with  the  various governmental inspection services in a cooperative effort to work out simpler clearance documentation and procedures at airports where international passengers or cargo arrive and depart.

Cooperation carries right up the line from the individual nation to the United  Nations  and  its  specialized  agencies,  particularly  ICAO,  which  sets standards and recommended practices for cutting red tape through Annex 9 to its Convention. Since the inception of IATA and ICAO, there has been constant collaboration. Numerous other international organizations, both governmental and non-governmental, Travel Agency Appointments cooperate with IATA to ensure the facilitation of air transport and to guard against the aircraft's particular vulnerability, which is the delay factor.

IATA has numerous tasks outside the formal framework of its committees and conferences. In postal matters, IATA is concerned with questions relating to the  speedy  and  expeditions  handling  of  mail  and  with  the  rates  paid  by governments to foreign airlines for the transportation of mail. It keeps up close association with the Universal Postal Union on these matters and has time after time encouraged reduction in airmail postage rates.

##  IATA Allied Service :

IATA conducts various functions. The IATA collates and publishes industry statistics. It is a documentation centre and publishes on behalf of its members, issuing internal manuals, tabulations of airlines distances, technical surveys, reports and other important industry information. The Association Protection Advisory  Committee  comprises  of  senior  representatives  in  the  economic, technical, public relations fields and legal, studies the manner in which airlines can reduce noise and emissions and yet profit from the progress of technology.

In the field of public relations, IATA maintains a worldwide information programme, furnishes source material for students of air transport, acts as a spokesperson for the industry and provides a number of special publicity and promotional services. The work of IATA's Public Relations Department, guided by the Public Relations Advisory Committee, also includes the organization of PR Conferences and Regional Panels as part of its effort to foster cooperation among the public relations offices of member airlines.

In order to carry out several functions, IATA has a staff of over 500 people through the world and operates with funds provided in the form of annual dues paid by members.

Broadly speaking, IATA is the world association of scheduled airlines with which it coordinates its efforts to serve its passengers, shares their experiences and analyses their problems. Representing over 180 companies from100odd countries, together they provide a bulk of world scheduled air services. IATA plays a leading role in three respects, on the basis of the aims defined in its statutes. The Association provides machinery for the airlines for finding joint solutions to problems often beyond the resources of any single company. Through the Association, airlines have succeeded in standardizing their operating methods and with their complementary routes, they have created a worldwide public service network, despite the many differences in language, currency, legislation and regulations.

The Association is able to act as an intermediary between governments and their users. It is the world parliament of airline companies and their spokesperson vis-a-vis various other international bodies. For governments, it serves as a forum where proposals for international rates and fares are formulated in a natural context for study and approval. For the general public it symbolizes the uniform quality of services, the use of rational commercial methods by airlines and agents, the simplification of formalities and the lowest possible fares and rates consistent with sound economy. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) plays a very important role in the area of representing and serving not only the airline industry but also the general public who use its services. The activities and goals of IATA cover the entire gamut in the areas of air transport, which is the key to the development of modem travel and tourism.

## 2.6 INTERNATIONAL  CIVIL  AVIATION  ORGANIZATION (ICAO)  :

The convention providing for the establishment of the International Civil Aviation Organization was drawn up by the International Civil Aviation Conference held in Chicago from November 1 to December 7, 1944. A Provisional International Civil Aviation

Organization  (PICAO)  functioned  from  6  June,  1945  until  the  formal establishment of ICAO. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) wasformally established on April 4, 1947 as a specialized agency of the United Nations. ICAO has a membership of over 130 governments joinedfor the common purpose of promoting civil aviation on a global scale. The headquarters of the organization are located at Montreal, Canada. The organization has its regional offices in Mexico City, Lima, Paris, Dakar, Cairo and Bangkok.

The  International  Civil  Aviation-Organization  representing  over  130 governments of various countries throughout the world provides the machinery for the achievement of greater global cooperation in the matters of civil aviation. Over the years, the organization has achieved great success in various matters relating to civil aviation.

##  Objectives :

The  main  aim  of  the  organization  is  developing  the  techniques  and principles of international air navigation and fostering the planning and development of international air transport with the following goals in mind :

- · Ensuring the safe and methodical growth of international civil aviation all over the globe

## International  Tourism Organizations

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

- · Encourage the arts of aircraft design and operation for peaceful purposes
- · Encourage the development of airways, airports and navigation facilities for international civil aviation
- · Achieve the requirements of the people of the world for economical, safe, efficient, regular, air transport
- · Prevent economic waste caused by unreasonable competition
- · Ensure that the rights of contracting countries are fully respected and that every contracting country has a fair opportunity to operate international airlines
- · Avoid discrimination between contracting countries
- · Endorse safety of flight in international air navigation
- · Promote generally the development of all aspects of international civil aeronautics

In addition to the above, the International Civil Aviation Organization through its various proposals tries for the reduction of customs, immigration, public health and other formalities in order to facilitate air transportation. As part of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  the  organization  provides technical assistance to states in developing civil aviation programmes. Development of regional plans for ground facilities and services needed for international flying is another important function of the Organization : The Organization disseminates air transport statistics and prepares studies on aviation economics. It also fosters the development of air law conventions.

##  Organization of ICAO :

The principal organ of ICAO is an Assembly. The Assembly consists of all the members of the Organization and is the sovereign body of ICAO It meets every three years and reviews in detail the work of the Organization It sets the policy for the next three years. The Organization has a Council, which comprises of 30 states and which is elected by the Assembly for a period of three years. While electing the states, the Assembly gives adequate representation to :

- 1. Member states of major importance in air transport
- 2. Those  member  states  not  otherwise  included  which  make  the  largest contribution to the provision of facilities for the international civil air navigation
- 3. Those  member  states  not  otherwise  included  and  whose  election  will ensure that major geographical areas of the world are represented

As a governing body, the council gives continuous direction to the work of the organization. The main subsidiary bodies are the Air Navigation Commission, composed of 12 members elected by the council; Air Transport Committee, open to council members; and the Legal Committee, on which all members of ICAO may be represented.

A close look at the range of activities and objectives of both International Air Transport Association and International Civil Aviation Organization indicates that they play a key role in the growth and development of international air transport. Their role since inception has been that of fostering the growth of air transport. Although not directly concerned with tourism, they have, however, played an important role in its growth over the years by way of encouraging air transport.

##  Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) :

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was founded in the year 1961 to foster economic growth and development for the member countries. The Headquarters of the organization are located in Paris (FRANCE). OECD has 24 member countries.

OECD has a tourism committee that comprises of tourism officials that are selected from all 24-member countries. Through its tourism, committee OECD carries out most of its work related to tourism the tourism committee produces regular  reports  and  technical  papers  comprising  statistical  data  on  tourism development to and within these countries. Over the years, the members of the OECD have made concerted efforts to advance people's freedom to travel across borders with minimum barriers. The country members, which are selected from the 24 countries, have the task of influencing their respective governments about the nature and direction that tourism must take in major industrial countries. One of the important publications of OECD is the report' Policy and International Tourism in OECD Member countries" which is published every year and reviews current tourism issues and trends in tourism activity for each country. The review is done annually and serves as an important document for policy makers.

## 2.7 EUROPEAN  TRAVEL  COMMISSION  (ETC)  :

European Travel Commission (ETC) was established in the year 1948 as a  non-profit-making  body  by  the  national  tourism  organizations  (NTOs)  of various European Countries. It has 26 member countries. The objectives of the European Travel Commission (ETC) are :

- · To foster international tourism co-operation in Europe
- · To exchange information on tourism development projects and marketing techniques
- · To undertake/commission appropriate travel research concerning various issues related to travel and tourism
- · To promote tourism within and to, Europe, from other parts of the world particularly from North America and Europe

The commission's functions include research, marketing and a range of allied tourism policy issues. The activities of the European Travel Commission are  supported  by  the  European  commission,  which  considers  tourism  as  an industry of great potential and of great economic and social significance within the community.

## After working through this unit, you would be able to describe :

- · Ecotourism.
- · Principles and benefits of ecotourism
- · Understand Adventure Tourism.
- · Understand classification of Adventure Tourism

## 3.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Tourism industry and its demands cause seriousdamage to our environment. Because of increase demands of touring people, development at tourist's places can lead to destruction of its very natural resources that attracts travellers. Due to these reasons, travel industry characterized a new approach to tourism which supports the conservation of natural resources, habitats etc by avoiding harming or  destroying  normal  environment.  Tourism  which  has  very  less  impact  on

environment is known as Ecotourism or Ecological tourism. In travel and tourism industry  Ecotourism  is  one  of  the  largest  growing  sectors.  The  purpose  of ecotourism in order to maintain species and habitats especially in underdeveloped regions is to engross tourists in non-consumptive, low impact and locally oriented environments.  There  are  many  other  terms  for  ecotourism  like  sustainable tourism, green tourism, ethical tourism, environmentally friendly tourism, adventure travel etc.

It is a given that all travel will have some negative environmental impact, including pollution, habitat disruption and resource depletion. The challenge for ecotourism is to minimize that impact, which is one of ecotourism's ultimate goals, while providing economic incentives to local people and businesses.

One of the largest discrepancies in the travel industry is the confusion between  ecotourism  and  adventure  travel.  While  the  terms  are  often  used synonymously, their goals and impacts can be very different. Adventure travel insulates  you  from  the  local  environment  and  then  utilizes  its  resources. Unfortunately, there is a blur between the two. Adventure travel is definitely big business, but only some of it is green. Because the business is so vast and competitive, many tour operators adopt eco-friendly practices for their own selfpreservation and to grow their business. They need to preserve these areas for future business, for that they need to adopt environmentally friendly activities.

## 3.2 ADVENT OF ECOTOURISM AND ADVENTURE TOURISM :

Adventure tourism starts with activities like mountaineering in Himalayas and  rafting  in  rivers  in  1970s.  Opening  of  national  parks  and  sanctuaries worldwide for general people led to another form of adventure travel which is known as jungle safari in 1980s. Ecotourism starts getting popular in general public at the start of 1990s. Its starts with a boom and its growth increase by 20 per cent every year since 1990 to 1996. Ecotourism and adventure tourism continued its growth in new century also and United Nation designated the year 2002 as International Year of Ecotourism because of its growing popularity. In 2004 World Tourism Organisation declares that ecotourism was growing three times faster than the tourism industry. For many countries, ecotourism is not simply a marginal activity to finance protection of the environment, but a major industry of the national economy. For example, in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nepal, Kenya, Madagascar and territories such as Antarctica, ecotourism represents a significant portion of the gross domestic product and economic activity.

Rising conscious about the global warming and the destruction of the charm  of  its  natural  resources  and  beauty  by  the  tourist  are  some  biggest motivators for this market growth. Visiting to the new places or unexplored places offer a chance to socialize with the local population as people need a change from the  stressful  routine.  It  also  helps  to  get  to  an  opportunity  to  indulge  in adventurous activities. Marine, national parks and other parks with biodiversity, local cultures, protected status and traditional protectors of natural environments are the main attractions in the ecotourism industry.

## 3.3 ECOTOURISM  :

The word ecology is derived from Greek words 'Oikos' and 'logos'. Oikos means household and logos means study. Ecology is the study of life at home environment which signifies relation between people and their environment. The term ecology was first given by Reiter in 1868. It is generally, but not exclusively organised by specialised tour operators for small groups and large groups. Service provider partners at the destinations tend to be small locally owned businesses. The International Ecotourism Society defines ecotourism as "responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well being of local citizens". Ecotourism can also be defined as "travel that contributed actively to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage : includes local and indigenous communities in its planning, development, and operations and contributes to their well being".

Following questions must be asked to confirm ecotourism practices :

- · Is the environment is being cared for ?
- · Is there a genuine effort to help the local community ?
- · Are resources being left intact for future generations ?
- · Is the local culture is being valued and honoured and not just photographed ?

## 3.3.1 Principles of Ecotourism :

All  nature  based  forms  of  tourism  in which main motivation for tourists is to observe and appreciate nature as well as the traditional cultures prevailing in natural areas and their protection.  Ecotourism  is  about  uniting conservation,  communities  and  sustainable travel. This means that those who implement and  participate  in  and  market  ecotourism activities should adopt the following ecotourism

<!-- image -->

principles. The basic principles of ecotourism can be described in following points

- · It contains educational and interpretation features
- · It  minimises  negative  impacts  upon  the  natural  and  socio-cultural environment.
- · Supports the conservation of natural areas and wildlife.
- · Ecotourism  include  designing,  constructing  and  operating  low-impact facilities for tourists.
- · Minimizes air and water pollution as well as tourist waste.
- · Offers safe and enriching or educational visitor experiences.
- · Build environmental and cultural awareness and respect.
- · Provide positive experiences for both visitors and hosts.
- · Provide awareness towards the conservation of natural and cultural assets, both among locals and tourists.
- · Providing  alternative  employment  and  income  opportunities  for  local communities
- · Generate financial benefits for both local people and private industry.
- · Respects the cultural tradition of the host destination.
- · Maintains  and  enhances  the  landscape  so  as  to  avoid  physical  or environmental degradation.
- · Maximizes opportunities for local prosperity for the host destination in the form of long-term tourism viability, local management control, quality employment, local retention of visitor spending, and fair distribution of economic and social benefits.
- · Ecotourism helps in using non-renewable resources efficiently.
- · Deliver memorable interpretative experiences to visitors that help raise sensitivity to host countries' political, environmental, and social climates.

## 3.3.2 Ecotourism Trends :

Latest ecotourism surveys can back-up the fact that currently people prefer eco-friendly products and services. In fact, one in three consumers prefers ecofriendly options during tourism. It might be the time to give your business a fresh start, below you will find the main trends in Ecotourism :

Empowerment of Women in Developing Countries : Different initiatives have been created to deliver a strong message to empower women around the world. There is the Me Too Movement, for example, the tourism industry is no exception to this. One of the recent trends in ecotourism is to improve and support the local women and empower them. Societies are searching for ways to promote gender equality and help women reach their full economic potential.

Nature Reserves and Safaris : Recently, various lodges and camps are opening in Africa, which is a significant step for eco-travel. This idea is to make travelling more responsible towards sustaining natural reserves.Game reserves primarily allow wildlife animals to live safely, and they also play a huge role in the development of communities in natural-diverse areas. Now, local communities get benefits from Ecotourism as they are contributing to protecting wildlife and making sure that their impact on the environment is favourable.

Discovering New Less Crowded Places : It isn't too delightful to visit a monument crowded with people, but that is not the only reason for avoiding crowded  places.  More  often,  travellers  are  taking  more  responsibility  and avoiding places struggling with over-tourism and looking for new less crowded place which is on the top of the list of recent traveller.

Say 'No to Plastic : The plastic waste crisis has been quite a debate for the past few years and recent sentiments of people are completely against the usage of plastic. A 2017 study found that 6.3 billion tons of the world's 8.3 billion tons were plastic waste. Embracing ecotourism involves actively reducing plastic footprint. Travelling itself is an eye-opening activity; it could also allow people to notice the seriousness of some issues like the harsh consequences of plastic pollution.

Introduction to Hospitality Management

International Conferences on Ecotourism : There are many Ecotourism, and Sustainable Tourism Conferences that take place around the world every year which is joined by several countries. They involve major tourist groups to support sustainability in the tourism industry and to protect popular natural destinations which are at risk.

<!-- image -->

What to Expect in the Future : Ecotourism has created a responsible market base that has attracted thousands of tourists who are more inclined towards sustainable and responsible travel. As of now, the conservation of frequently visited  natural  resources  is  one  of  the  main  challenges  associated  with  the promotion of green tourism and ecotourism.

It is crucial to promote smart growth which is beneficial for local traders. Natural resources are flooded with hotels, restaurants andother travel services. As a consequence of unethical tourism, lots of local workers may live without basic sanitation, clean water, health services, proper education, and more.To create well-planned destinations in the future, governments should also take responsibility. Without local planning, ecotourism could be an additional problem for the landscape. Local communities need to realise that they need to protect their resources for the future, preserving the environment and assuring the future of tourism is friendly to our Earth

## 3.3.3 Benefits of Ecotourism :

- · Builds environmental awareness and its conservation methods.
- · Provides direct financial benefits for conservation to local area and local people.
- · Provides employment to local people.
- · Improving the well being of local people and thus empower them.
- · Local culture is being honoured and valued by people visiting them.
- · Ecotourism provides the opportunity for not only environmentalists, but also tourists to learn more about the ecosystems, biology, and geology of a specific location.
- · Ecotourism can end cultural ignorance, stereotyping, and fear in the world through its ability to educate travellers.
- · Ecotourism provides an impactful firsthand experience about sustainable living and eco-friendly practices.
- · It also promotes and preserves traditional practices, locally grown food and crafted goods
- · Some part of money spends on ecotourism, goes toward conservation efforts like reforestation and endangered species repopulation projects. Essentially, the more money spent on ecotourism, the easier it will be to finance conservation projects.
- · It provides funds for ecological conservation and directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities.
- · It promotes sustainable use of natural resources.
- · Maximize tourism in particular area.
- · It helps in conserving natural resources and natural beauty so that our future generation will be able to experience it.

Eco Tourism and Adventure Tourism

Introduction to Hospitality Management

Adventure tourism can be defined as "the movement of the people from one to another place outside their comfort zone for exploration or travel to remote areas, exotic and possibly hostile areas which must include overnight stay, but not last longer than one year".

## 3.4.1 History of Adventure Tourism :

Humans are travelling from ancient time for foods, jobs, work, for religious purpose, for wars, trade and for many other reasons. Adventurous travel was also very old form of travel for humans for hundreds of year in the form of exploration. People travelled in ancient time for exploration of sea roots to different countries, for new destination. However, commercial adventure travel is not a very old phenomenon. Commercial adventure travel includes hiring of a professional guide to provide a range of technical support, regional support, cultural and nature interpretation and equipment. In the mid 1800s, adventure travellers began to push the limits of adventures like mountain climbing and river rafting, with the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 and decent of the Colorado River in 1869. Shortly thereafter, two key institutions were formed, The National Geographic Society and Explorers Club. These institutions are supporting adventures tourism continuously. In the mid-1950s, many adventurers attracted global attention and recognition, thus inspired many people to attempt their own expeditions.

<!-- image -->

Maurice Herzog's ascent of Annapurna in 1950, Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's ascent of Mount Everest, and other successes were hailed in the media around the world. This was the takeoff of modern adventure tourism. Today, adventure tourism is a vibrant, dynamic, and one of the fastest growing sectors.

## 3.4.2 Classification of Adventure Tourism :

Adventure Tourism market can be classified in many ways. Classification of adventure tourism can be based on (i) Nature of risk involved (ii) On the basis of surroundings where adventure tourism is based.

## 3.4.2.1 Nature of Risk Involved :

Hard Adventure : Hard adventure refers to adventure activities with highest levels of risk involved, it requires intense commitment, advanced skills and courage. Hard tourism includes the activities like climbing mountains, rocks, ice trekking, trekking, caving, sky diving, bungee jumpingetc.Hard adventure activities are highly risky in nature. Advance and learned skills and trained professional guidance are required to perform these dangerous activities. Many

tourists died during climbing mountains, caving, trekking every day. There is an interesting fact that is for K2, world second highest mountain peak, for every two people who submit one dies.

<!-- image -->

Soft Adventure : Soft adventure is activities with perceived low levels of risks. It requires minimal commitment and beginning skills to indulge in these activities. All of these activities should be led by experienced guides as per law. Soft tourism includes the activities like backpacking, camping, hiking, kayaking, scuba diving etc.Soft adventure is a popular category in adventure tourism. On average 25% trips taken from North America and Europe are soft adventure trips.

## 3.4.3 Risks Involved in Adventure Tourism :

There are two types of risks in adventure tourism. These two risks are

Micro Risks : The  risks  which  a  traveller  faces  and  happens  during adventure tourism or sport is known as 'micro risks'. These risks are directly appearing in front of traveller during adventure activities. These risks are the main attractions of adventure tourism and have positive impact on adventure tourism.

Macro Risks : These are the risks which affects the whole adventure tourism rather than individual adventure traveller. The local political environment, incident of terrorism, economic fluctuation and social conditions etc. are macro risks. Macro risks have negative impact on adventure tourism.

The  goal  of  adventure  tourism  is  having  experience  of  beating  risks, overcoming difficulties, and facing challenges rather than the perceived risk itself. These micro risks attract adventure traveller and acts as a main motivator to tourists. These are the risks which people are looking for. Perception of risks involved in adventure tourism is very subjective and depends on individual. Something which is risky for someone may be a fun activity to other. Risks associated with adventure tourism are :

- · Loss of life
- · Grave injuries
- · Broken bones
- · Flooding accidents

- · Equipment failure
- · Mechanical failure
- · Possibility of falling risks
- · Terrorism
- · Political disturbance
- · Psychological disappointment with travel experience

- · Physical activity, i.e. activities involving physical exertion or psychomotor skills.
- · Contact with nature, i.e. activities bringing contact with the natural world in general, or with specific wildlife.
- · Contact with different cultures, i.e. people, faith, lifestyles.

## Eco Tourism and Adventure Tourism

## Introduction to Hospitality Management

to plan for worst possible scenario just in case if something goes wrong during the trip. Traveller has to find out weather forecast for the time when they are going for adventure tourism. Travellers should always leave a trail to be followed if they lost contact with the base. They should sign and mention dates on as many guest books as possible at every site or attractions they visit. It is important to make friends along the way with people who could remember them if shown a picture.

The other aspect of planning is to understand what safety equipment is required for a specific adventure and location where the travellers are going. The traveller needs sufficient and correct communicational equipment, for example : GPS equipment, emergency radio which shows weather forecast, radio phone etc  to  communicate.  Traveller  should  also  have  correct  knowledge  of  the environment and should have necessary protective gears in order to protect themselves.  Each  and  every  traveller  should  adhere  to  all  safety  rules  and procedure.  The  other  safety  rule  is  to  go  through  survival  school  on  the environment where the traveller is going and in order to have opportunity to defend them and survive high risk situations. Adventure traveller must have proper safety equipment like complete first aid kit, personal protective equipment (PPE), etc.

## 3.10 CASE STUDY :

Adventure is a need of monotonous life, people seeking adventure in India are our guest, customer and visitors of the culture of the country, therefore, it is the responsibility of people, tour agents and government of the country to provide best possible services to them. There is so much to improve but time is running out as the country is facing increasing competition from other Asian countries. The factor which mostly restrains adventure tourism in India is poor road condition and connectivity to adventure tour destinations. This problem is almost common for each region, once again pointing at poor state of infrastructure of the country. Apart from poor roads, lack of medical facilities, toilet and poor clean water facilities are also common in case of hilly states. In west zone Maharashtra is facing the problem of customer awareness about safety and risk

## ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING

The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## PREFACE

We have put in lots of hard work to make this book as userfriendly as possible, but we have not sacrificed quality. Experts were involved in preparing the materials. However, concepts are explained in easy language for you. We  have included many tables and examples for easy understanding.

We sincerely hope this book will help you in every way you expect. All the best for your studies from our team!

## Block Introduction :

A hotel is defined by many as an operation in itself that offers lodging and ancillary services for individuals who have been away from home. The definition was comprised, keeping in mind the people from varied backgrounds and age groups who spend a lot of time away from home for various reasons. Therefore, it includes the traditional concept of hotels as well as other forms of lodging like condominiums, motels, camps, hostels, etc.

The various operations in a hotel reflect the working of the hotel. In other words, when the mangers and other managerial post individuals get down to planning the overall operations of a hotel, they have to include everything, right from the accommodation to the food and beverage services offered to the guests.

The first unit speaks of the classification of various divisions in a hotel. The second unit on the other hand speaks specifically of Front office division. Third unit discuss about F&B sector which is an equally essential element of the hotel operations. Fourth and final unit discuss the importance of other divisions which are considered as support division of every hotel.

## 1.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Illustrate the various departments of hotels
- · Point out the functions of the departments of hotel
- · Outline the various sections of room's division department.

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION  :

The primary function of a hotel is to provide lodging accommodation & meals. At the same time provides luxuries like recreation facilities etc. It is the responsibility of the hotel to pay maximum attention towards the comforts of the guests. The first interaction between the hotel & the guest is the reservation (when the guest enquires about the room). As first impression is the last impression & thus hotel should take efforts in giving good experience at the time of reservation. The reservation staff must keep themselves updated about the status of the rooms, the facilities & the amenities the hotel is offering. As rooms generate considerable revenue  for  the  hotel,  reservation  demands  a  great  deal  of  attentiveness  & responsibilities. The reservations could be confirmed or waitlisted as well as guaranteed & non-guaranteed.

As a part of the front office team an individual is involved with one of the two processes reservation or registration on day-to-day basis. Hence, in this unit we cover the various means through which the hotel receives reservations. We then move on to covering the various processes that are followed by the front office staff once the guest has reserved a room at the hotel. The next important function that is centre of all activities of the front office department is registration.

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

This unit covers the various forms that are filled and various methods that are followed during this process checking-in a guest.

Food and beverage service has been written to detail the basic knowledge and skills necessary for those studying/or working at a variety of levels in food and beverage service. The book also provides frameworks on which to build further studies and on which to relate further acquired knowledge and experience.

Food service operations are continuing to enjoy tremendous improvement and development together with considerable advances in quality. The demand for food and beverages away from the home has increased and, with a broader spectrum of the population eating out, customer needs have diversified.

Food and restaurant styles are also diversifying to meet the challenges of the demands being made by increasingly knowledgeable and value conscious customers. Menu and beverage list contents are also continually being influenced by trends, fads and fashions, the relationship between health and eating, special diets,  cultural  and  religious  influences  the  advance  of  vegetarianisms,  and customer acceptance, or otherwise of irradiation and genetically modified foods.

## 1.2 THE  DEPARTMENTS  OF  HOTEL  ORGANISATION  :

A large hotel is run by a general manager and an executive committee comprised of the key executives who head major departments : room's division director,  food  and  beverage  director,  marketing  and  sales  director,  human resources director, chief accountant or controller, and chief engineer or facility manager. These executives generally have a regional or corporate counterpart with whom they have a reporting relationship, although the general manager is their immediate superior.

Management structure differs among larger, mid-scale and smaller properties. The mid-scale and smaller properties are less complex in their management structures than the larger ones. In case of large organizations, every department will be managed by a manager where there will be executives working under him. Whereas in smaller setups, someone must be responsible for each of the key result areas that make the operation successful.

Someone must be responsible for each of the key result areas that make the operation successful. For example a small property may not have a director of human resources, but each department head will have general day-to-day operating responsibilities for the human resources function. The manager will have the ultimate responsibility for all human resources decisions. The same scenario is possible with each of the following areas : housekeeping & front office, engineering and maintenance, accounting and finance, marketing and sales, food and beverage management, and so on.

##  Revenue and Support Centre :

Classification of the departments or divisions of a hotel can be done in a number of ways, such as by the service offered (food, beverage, rooms, recreation, etc.) or by grouping them as either a revenue centre or a support centre.

Revenue Centres (or operational departments) sells goods or services to guests and thereby generate revenue for the hotel.

Examples of major revenue centre's are :

- · Rooms Division
- · Food and Beverage Division

Minor or ancillary revenue centres are :

- · Guest telephones
- · Guest laundry
- · Recreational facilities
- · Business centre

Support centres provide a supporting role to the revenue divisions. These divisions usually do not provide direct services to guests and so do not generate revenue directly. But without their help revenue division cannot earn revenue

Examples of support centres are :

- · Sales and Marketing Division
- · Accounting Division
- · Engineering Division
- · Security Division
- · Human Resource Division

##  Front-Of-House and Back-Of-House Departments :

An alternative method of classifying hotel departments or divisions is by the extent to which they are involved in customer contact. In this respect, hotel departments may be divided into the front-of-house and the back-of-the-house departments.

Front-of-house departments are those in which employees have extensive guest contacts, such as reception, cashiers, concierge, restaurants, room service, bars and recreational areas.

Back-of-house departments are those in which the staffs has little or no direct guest contact, such as personnel, accounting and the engineering and purchasing departments.

## 1.3 THE  ROOM  DIVISION  ORGANISATION  :

## 1.3.1 Front Office :

The front office department is the most visible department in a hotel. It typically includes the reception desk, which is usually the place at which guests form their first impression of the hotel and functions as a focal point where registration and check out proceedings are done. The reservations, PBX, uniformed services and concierge are also part of the front office department. Each of these areas is responsible for certain functions and duties. Although each of these areas is separate, it is vital that they understand each other's work for a hotel to operate effectively and harmoniously. It is only through a team effort that a hotel can

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

create an environment that will provide the highest level of guest services. The front office manager is responsible for the smooth functioning of the front office functions.

Front desk generally consists of the reception and cashier while front office is a department which includes all its sub-sections. The front desk area in a hotel is operational 24 hours per day. It is the centre of a hotel, the place where guests turn to seek information, to get help, and to register most of their complaints. When the busy check-in or check-out times occur, the front desk area takes on the challenge of serving every guest as quickly as possible. This is a challenge because just checking in or checking out the guest quickly is not enough. All guests must be dealt with in such a way that they feel as though they have received special treatment. The front desk supervisor is the person who is directly involved in meeting this challenge.

Through the registration process, the guest service agent provides the first initial contact a guest has with the hotel. After this contact, guests feel that the front desk is the place to call or go when they have a question or problem. An area that needs special attention is the effect that the agent has on the guest's perception of the hotel and the amount of satisfaction the guest will derive from his or her stay. The effect of a pleasant, friendly, helpful agent, as opposed to one that is rude, aloof and uncaring, can easily be seen. The basic functions performed by the guest service agent are the registration process (with related cashier duties) and the assisting of guests with any requests they make. The guest service agent's main concern is, of course, service to the guests. This service can be accomplished by acknowledging the guests' presence even if they cannot be served at once, always calling guests by name, and smiling and looking at the guests when serving them.

The night auditor prepares various reports for management. Statistics such as  the  average  room  rate,  percentage  of  double  occupancy,  percentage  of occupancy and other figures are needed daily by management to review the results of  operations.  Additionally,  a  report  indicating  the  status  of  every  room  is prepared for the housekeeping department.

##  Sections of Front Office Department :

In the rooms division most departments or sections are involved in the sales of rooms as well as the provision of services and facilities for guests.

The rooms division is composed or two major departments : the front office department and housekeeping department. Within the front office and housekeeping departments, smaller departments will be formed to focus on specific duties. Only the largest hotel will have all of these different departments.

Telephones : The telephone department of hotels is now utilizing automated systems, making it possible to employ less staff in the telephone department. A computer based switchboard systems makes it easier to transfer calls to guestrooms and departments. Call accounting systems can automatically calculate costs of

telephone calls and charge it to the guest accounts. Voice processing systems enables guests to programme their own wake-up calls. Voice message recording enables callers to leave voice messages. Direct dialling facilities are standard in most hotel rooms. The switchboard is operational 24 hours a day and often the location of the fire-checking equipment.

Reservations : The reservations department falls under the front office even though their office might not be located in the front office area. Internet reservations  and  enquiries  made  through  email  or  fax  is  dealt  with  by  the reservations department the following day. Reservation office staff must observe the utmost of telephone etiquette and speak in a clear voice.

Reception : The main responsibility of the reception is checking guests in and out of the hotel. They also handle any queries from guests and visitors or  refer  them  to  the  appropriate  department.  The  reception  desk  will  be operational 24 hours a day. As discussed earlier, the larger the hotel, the more specialised the duties of the reception personnel.

Cashier : The main responsibility of the cashier is accepting payment of guests' account and dealing with currency exchanges. When a hotel has safe deposit boxes, this will fall under the cashier's responsibility. Revenue centres such as the restaurants, bars and reception, will receive their floats and pay in their takings at the cashier's office. The head cashier may prepare the banking and carry out the paying-in to bank, but in some units this will be done by a member of the accounts staff. The night auditor covers the night shift between 11.00pm to 8.00am hours. During these hours the main responsibilities are to post charges to update client accounts, produce a trial balance and prepare management reports. As the cashier has access to large amounts of money, honesty is one of the most important qualities a cashier should have. The cashier must also be familiar with money and confident in handling very large sums.

Bill Office : The posting of charges and payments on to guests' accounts are handled by the bill office. At the end of the day and accounting periods, the bill office is responsible for extracting summaries of sales figures. Bill office staff needs to be methodical and have a grasp of figures. The bill office is becoming more automated with charges being posted directly to guest accounts through Point of Sale systems, allowing for fewer staff to be employed in the bill office.

Uniformed Staff Department : The department is headed by the bell captain, which is more often referred to as the concierge. Concierge is the French term for porter. In large hotels concierge is different from bell desk. Other staffs in this department include doormen and luggage bell boys. Again, the size of the hotel,  the  standard  of  the  hotel  and  type  of  customers  will  influence  the organisation of the uniformed staff department. In smaller hotels, the concierge responsibility can be taken over by the reception. The hotel might then only have luggage porters to assists guests with luggage. Budget hotel might not have this department at all.

Kiosk : A kiosk selling newspapers, gifts and other essentials is often located inthe hotel lobby. This shop will either be operated directly by the hotel, or, more commonly, be rented out as a concession to a specialist company. In the concession agreement the hotel will have the right to dictate important points concerning opening hours and the range of goods on sales.

## 1.3.2 Housekeeping Department :

The housekeeping department is the largest department in the hotel in number of staff employed. One maid is needed for every 12-15 rooms. Beside room maids, the department also employs supervisors, house porters, laundry and linen staff and general cleaners. The housekeeper is responsible for the preparation of guest rooms for sales and the cleanliness of all public areas of the hotel. Close liaison between the housekeeper and reception is essential so that rooms are available for sale as quickly as possible. Special requests are often passed to housekeeping through the reception department.

The busiest time of day for the housekeeping department is in the mornings when guests are checking out and rooms need to be cleaned for new arrivals. Hotels might also have evening service which is referred to as turn down service. In some transient hotels, 24-hour servicing is provided by the housekeeping department. Increasingly, many hotels have come to rely upon the services of contract cleaning, rather than employing a full staff on the payroll.

Five Star hotels might employ a valet to take care of guest's dry cleaning, pressing and laundry. The valet reports to the head housekeeper.

##  Management of the Departments :

All of these departments will have a department head or supervisor who reports to the Rooms' Division Manager. The cashier and bill office staff report to the hotel accountant for matters of operating procedures, training and policy but they are responsible to the Rooms' Manager for their shifts, appearance, and supervision  in  day-to-day  matters.  This  split  responsibility  requires  a  good working relationship between the Rooms Manager and the hotel accountant so that there is no conflict in the instructions that are given to the operating staff of the department.

##  Laundry :

This department is responsible for cleaning, repairing, stitching of linen used in a hotel, e. g. it can be bed sheets, waiter's cloth uniforms of the employee. Increasingly,  hotels  are  operating  their  own  laundries.  This  sub-department generally reports to the executive housekeeper. The modern laundry operates computerized washing/drying machines and large presses.

Some hotels, especially the smaller and older ones, contract out the laundry service. This is because it is costly to alter an existing hotel to provide space for laundry for the reason of scarcity of funds, space etc. In addition, by contracting out the hotel does not have to own its own linen. It may rent linen and it may be charged for each piece used. However, operators frequently complain that they receive inferior linen and inconsistent services.

##  Layout of the Housekeeping Department :

There is no ideal or universal model for the layout of a housekeeping department. The layout differs from hotel to hotel and is dependent upon its size and physical space limitation. However, if the executive housekeeper is involved in the facility planning stage, she must be told the no. of function rooms and the volume of business anticipated so as to estimate the amount of linen required. She  must  also  determine  whether  the  management  intends  to  contract  out horticulture, tailoring, maintenance, upholstery, etc to include or preclude space for such activities. It is also necessary to estimate carefully the traffic flows and the size of equipment and trolleys etc that need to be moved around so that there is no cluttering and congestion. The following diagram represents the layout of a housekeeping department as a whole.

Guaranteed reservation helps the hotel in earning revenue in case of no-show. No-show is

a term for guests who made their reservation but do not come to hotel or cancel the reservation. Method of payment for guaranteed reservations are as follows :

Prepayment : When a guest paid full in advance for his or her stay prior to arrival is prepayment guaranteed reservation. Prepayment guaranteed reservation is very common at the time when hotel is running at full occupancy.

"I am sorry sir; we do not take breakfast order after 10 :00."

"Ok, can I get an early lunch or brunch as I am hungry ?"

"I am sorry sir; we serve brunch after 11 :15 only"

Beverage Outlets The  Commercial Sector

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

##  The Commercial Sector :

Commercial food and beverage outlets are those operations in which profit is a primary concern. They exist not only in private ownership but also in the publicly owned sector of the market where, for example, a local leisure centre may seek to operate catering outlets on commercial lines. Also, it is worth noting that  in  the  commercial  sector,  catering  may  be  the  main  activity  of  the organization or it may be a secondary or additional service to customers as, for example, catering in department stores or theatres. A broad distinction can be made between catering for a restricted market and catering for a general market. In the case of the former, the market can be restricted in a number of ways : by way of membership criteria as in the case of catering in clubs or by the fact that the catering is only available to those engaged in a specific activity as in the case of travel catering or employee catering. However, there will be some overlap in some cases. For example, catering at a railway station, bus or airport terminal is normally open to the traveller as well as to the general public, while catering on the train, bus or plane itself is limited to those travelling double advantage of offering the customer a place to sit and relax away from the dining area and allowing a faster seat turnover in the restaurant.

##  Commercial Catering for Open Market :

- 1. Public (licensed) Houses /Pubs : Public houses consist of a varied group of establishments, which mainly offer the general public alcoholic liquor for sale for consumption on and off the premises. The supply of food, at one time ancillary to liquor, is an increasingly dominant element in the 'product mix' for the consumer.

The characteristics of public houses are, first, that they require a magistrate's license to operate that is only granted to suitable persons and, second, that many  public  houses  are  owned  by  a  brewery  company,  providing  an integration of their production with the retail distribution of alcoholic beverages.

To become more competitive and to meet customers' demands, the catering premises in most pubs have improved considerably in recent years. Some brewery companies have classified their public houses by the level of catering offered. This ranges from those offering only sandwiches through to hot and cold snacks, a cold buffet counter, a bistro-type operation, a griddle or steak bar and a full à la carte menu. The range of food items offered is mainly of the convenience food type but at times extends to the total fresh food items. Several brewery companies market specific pubs by the type of catering offered with a brand image, for example Big Steak as part of Allied Domecq Inns.

- 2. Fast Food and Take-Away : This sector of the industry is concerned with the preparation and service of food and beverages quickly for immediate sale to the customer for consumption either on or off the premises. These range from the traditional fish and chip shop through a series of ethnic cuisines to the high street branded operations of McDonald's, Burger King or KFC.

At the fast food end of the market, there are a number of characteristics common to many of the outlets. First, units are usually themed around a product (for example, hamburgers) a range of products (for example, fish or pizza), or products of a country (for example, Chinese, Italian). This

'product' is very well marketed, for example from a themed product to decor and atmosphere, to the high and consistent standard of the product, to advertising on television, local radio and newspapers, to the container boxes for take-away items. Second, the method of food production is often partially or fully automated, often using commodities of the convenience type  (for  example,  frozen  chips,  concentrated  beverage  syrups),  and thereby de-skilling the job and restricting the product range variable. Similarly, the method of food service is simplified and basic.

- 3. Function and Event Catering : Function and event catering may be described as the service of food and beverages at a specific time and place, for a given number of people, to an agreed menu and price. Examples of function catering include social functions, such as weddings and dinner dances; business functions such as conferences, meetings and working lunches and those functions that are organized for both social and business reasons such as outdoor catering at a sports event, show or exhibition.

Function catering is found in both the commercial and non-commercial sectors of the catering industry. In the commercial sector, function catering could be a specialist organization operating in its own function facilities or an outdoor catering specialist operating in a vast range of clients' or rented facilities or within marquees, or as a separate department within a hotel. Anyone who has visited a major sporting event cannot fail to be impressed by the scale and range of catering that takes place within the 'tented village'. Indeed some visitors seem to take more interest in the food and beverage provision than in the sports event they have been invited to attend.

In  the  non-commercial  sector,  function  catering  is  rarely  the  primary reason  for  providing  the  establishment  with  catering  facilities.  Such establishments include hospitals, schools, industrial cafeterias, etc. where the functions are not usually organized on a purely profit basis as they are in  the  commercial  sector,  but  rather  to  serve  a  specific  need  of  the organization. Typical examples would be Christmas functions, retirement parties, fund-raising events, etc.

- 4. Chain-Catering Organizations : There are many establishments with chains spread over wide areas and in some cases overseas. Prospects for promotion and opportunities are often considerable, whether it is in a chain of  hotels  or  restaurants.  These  are  the  well  known  hotel  companies, restaurant Chains, the popular type of restaurant, chain stores and the shops with restaurants, which often serve lunches, teas and morning coffee, and have snack bars and cafeterias.

##  Commercial Catering for a Restricted Market Travel Catering :

##  Travel Catering :

Travel catering (that is, road, rail, air and sea) has "a number of characteristics not commonly associated with other food and beverage outlets. It frequently involves the feeding of a large number of customers arriving together at a catering facility, and who need to be catered for in a specific time, for example, on board a plane. The plane only carries sufficient food and beverage supplies for a specific number of meal periods. If for any reason this food cannot be served to customers, alternative supplies may not be readily available. The service of the food and beverages may be particularly difficult due to the physical conditions within the

## Food  and Beverage  Division

Introduction  to Hospitality Management

service area, for example, turbulence on board a plane. The types of restaurants described previously are usually catering for a specific and identifiable socioeconomic market. Travel catering often has to cater for 'mixed markets'. Finally, there are the problems of staffing these food and beverage facilities : the extra costs involved in the transportation and service of the food and beverages; space restrictions and the problem of security while the operation is in transit. Four main types of travel catering may be identified.

- · Road catering has progressed from the inns and taverns of earlier days used  by  those  travelling  on  foot  and  horseback  to  the  present-day motorway service areas and other roadside catering outlets, these service areas  are  also  particularly  prone  to  vandalism  and  littering.  They  do, however, provide a valuable catering service to the travelling public and their food and beverage facilities usually include self-service and waiter service restaurants, vending machines and takeaway foods and beverages. High street fast food operations are also now appearing both on motorway service areas and as freestanding drive-troughs.
- · Rail  catering may  be  conveniently  divided  into  two  areas  :  terminal catering  and  in-transit  catering.  Catering  at  railway  terminals  usually comprises licensed bars, self-service and waiter service restaurants, fast food and take- away units, supplemented by vending machines dispensing hot and cold foods and beverages. In-transit catering can feature three kinds of service. The first is the traditional restaurant car service where breakfast, lunch and dinner are organized in sittings and passengers go to the restaurant car for service where appropriate seating accommodation is provided, and then return to their seats on the train after their meal. In some cases meals are delivered direct to the seat of first class passengers only. The  second  type  of  service  is  the  buffet  car,  which  is  a  self-service operation in which passengers go to the car and buy light refreshments over the counter. The third is a trolley/ manual service where snacks and drinks are delivered to customers at their seats.
- · Airline Catering has increased and developed considerably over the past twenty-five years. Originally consisting of sandwiches and flasks of tea, coffee and alcoholic beverages, the progress to today's full and varied service has paralleled that of aircraft development itself. Like the railways, airline catering falls into two main areas : terminal catering, and 'in-transit' or 'in-fight catering. Food and beverage outlets at air terminals usually consist of self-service and waiter service restaurants, supplemented by vending machines and licensed bars. The in-flight catering service varies considerably with the class of Travel type and duration of flight. For the economy travellers, the food and beverage portions a highly standardized with  the  meals  portioned  into  plastic  trays  that  are  presented  to  the passengers  and  from  which  they  eat  their  meals.  Disposable  cutlery, napkins, etc. may be used to increase the standard of hygiene and reduce the weight carried and storage space required. For first class travellers there is virtually no portion control. Service may be from a gueridon trolley, where food is portioned in front of the customers and any garnishes, sauces, etc. are added according to their immediate requirements. The crockery used may be bone china and this combines with fine glassware and cutlery to create an atmosphere of high-class dining. A characteristic of airline catering is that this service is often contracted out lo a specialist catering

firm, which will supply a similar service to many airlines. The meal is usually included in the price of the fare and a particular feature is now made of cabin service facilities by different airlines. The growth in air travel has made competition fierce, and the area of food service is now a particularly competitive aspect of the total service offered by an airline.

- · Sea or Marine Catering Varies from the provision of food and beverages on the short sea route ferries to the large cruise or passenger liners where the catering facilities are an important part of the service offered by the shipping line and are usually included in the price of the fare. On the cruise liners  the  standard  of  catering  facilities  is  high  because  they  are  an important sales feature in a competitive activity. On the short sea routes, however, price is usually a more important factor and because of the necessity to feed large numbers of people in a short time the catering service provided is usually of the popular and fast food type.

##  Clubs :

Clubs, as a sector of the hotel and catering industry, are establishments offering food and drink, occasionally with accommodation, to members and their bona fide guests. The types of clubs range from working men's clubs, to political party clubs, social clubs, sporting clubs, restaurant clubs, to the private exclusive clubs. In England and Wales, clubs are of two main types : proprietary clubs and registered clubs.

Proprietary clubs are licensed clubs, owned by an individual or company and operated by themselves for profit, and as such require a justice's license to operate. Many such clubs resemble licensed restaurants with a substantial part of  their  turnover  obtained  from  the  sales  of  food.  Another  growing  sector comprises sports or health clubs that offer their members sporting, fitness and leisure facilities but where food is an ancillary service.

In registered clubs the management is responsible to an elected committee. The members own all the property including the food and drink, and pay their subscriptions to a common fund. As a non-profit making club that belongs to all the members and provides a service to the members, it does not require a justice's license to operate, simply to be registered. The turnover of members' clubs is mainly obtained from the sale of drinks that are normally sold at a competitive price, as the profit element in clubs is lower than, example, in public houses.

##  Institutional and Employee Catering - Contract Caterers :

Institutional and employee catering falls under the heading of subsidized and welfare catering, as indeed most of these types of operations are run on some form of a subsidized basis. However, it is worth considering that in parts of the private sector such catering activities may be operated on a commercial basis. For example, in many private hospitals and private schools the catering function is operated very much with commercial objectives in mind. Increasingly, contract caterers are providing catering services to the general public on behalf of their clients, for example in leisure centres, theatres or shops.

##  The Subsidized or Welfare Sector :

Subsidized or welfare food and beverage establishments may be defined as those operations in which making a profit from the catering facility is not the outlet's primary concern. Since the operations are either completely or partially subsidized by a parent body, such establishments' primary obligation is the well-

## Food  and Beverage  Division

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

being and cares of their customers or patients. Unlike customers frequenting commercial sector operations, these customers often do not have a choice of catering facilities, for example in hospitals and schools. Some non-commercial operations are subsidized by government bodies that dictate an allowance per head, or by parent companies that may have a similar arrangement.

##  Institutional Catering :

Institutional catering establishments include schools, universities, colleges, hospitals, the Services and prisons. In some of these establishments no charge is made to certain groups of customers to pay for the provision of the food and beverage  services  as  they  are  completely  or  partially  subsidized  by  various government funds. This is the part of the catering industry also referred to as the institutional sector.

- · Schools
- · Universities and Colleges
- · Hospitals
- · The Services
- · Prisons

##  Employee Catering :

As already outlined, this is the provision of catering services to employees. The activity may be performed either directly by the employer, or subcontracted out to contract caterers. A direct or in-house catering service that is running smoothly and being well managed is unlikely to change to using a contractor. Those  operations,  however,  that  are  experiencing  difficulty  may  be  wise  to consider employing the services of a catering contractor but in doing so must also be sure to define exactly what is required of the contractor in terms of level of service, costs per employee head, revenue, etc.

In providing a catering service for their employees, the parent company may decide at one extreme to subsidize the facility or at the other to pass all the costs on to the customer. In some sectors of the industry the catering service may be provided virtually free with the employees making only a small token payment per meal.

## 3.4 FOOD AND  BEVERAGE  PRODUCTION  :

A hotel kitchen is responsible for serving meals to the guest. There may be one big kitchen serving multiple outlets of the hotel or hotel can have separate kitchen for the serving outlets or one big kitchen may be accompanied by the satellite kitchen near the serving outlet. A hotel kitchen is under the charge of the executive chef. This person, in turn, is reports to the director of food and beverage for the efficient and effective operation of kitchen food production. The desired outcome is to exceed guests' expectations in the quality and quantity of food, its presentation, taste and portion size, and to ensure that hot food is served

hot and cold food is served cold. Some executive chefs are becoming kitchen managers; they even serve as food and beverage directors in midsized and smaller hotels. The kitchen staffs are under a great deal of pressure and works round the clock.

The organization of kitchens will vary, mainly due to the size and the type of the establishment. Organization depends on 5 factors

- · The menu as it determines the tasks; organization is based on the menu.
- · Type of establishment
- · Size of operation
- · Physical facilities
- · Human resources available.

## 3.5 KITCHEN  BRIGADE  :

The team of cooks and their assistants under the partie system is commonly called the specialists head the parties and with their assistants help produce complex dishes with great speed and efficiency. All the head of the parties come under the control of the Chef de Cuisine aided by one or more sous chefs. In small establishments, head of the larder or sauce section acts as Sous Chef.

## After working through this unit, you would be able to describe :

- · Other divisions of hotel.
- · Hierarchy of each division.
- · Management and other staff positions in each division.
- · The duties and responsibilities of each division in running a hotel.

## 4.1 INTRODUCTION  :

A person or any guest of a hotel may never understand the complexity of managing a hotel, its products and its services and day to day operation of a hotel. Starting from hotel entrance to aesthetically designed rooms required many hours of planning, training, coordination, communication and efforts of staff of each division of a hotel. Behind the wall working of each division may not be visible to all guests but it is the services that are the result of meticulous planning of

each department is visible. For smooth running of any hotel it is important that all the employees of each division must have good communication within the division and between divisions also.Front of the house divisions cannot provide good products and services without the help and assistance of back of the house divisions.  For  example  Front  Office  Department  can  only  sell  rooms  when housekeeping and maintenance department provide clean and safe rooms for guests.

So it is the teamwork of all division and department which helps in running a hotel smoothly. Every division should give their best to provide a wholesome environment to each and every guest of a hotel. Every guest has some basic expectation from the hotel, which every division of a hotel has to fulfil by working closely and efficiently. Basic guest's expectations from hotels are :

- · Safe and secure accommodation in a hotel.
- · A clean and comfortable guest room.
- · Good quality food and beverage facilities.
- · Courteous, professional, knowledgeable and friendly service.

## 4.14 CASE STUDY :

A hotel in India started a recruiting plan based on referrals from current employees of hotel. At starting year this system worked, primarily because hotel had a trained, knowledgeable, strong, competent staff during this period. However problems began to develop next year as fewer & fewer referred people applied to fill the increasing number of positions at the hotel. Despite of shrinking pool of applicants for increasing number of jobs, HR manager continued to rely on the employee referral system for his hotel. He justified this decision by saying "Even though fewer employees are available, the employee referral method brings employees into our chain who are knowledgeable, know about our hotel and its working & as per our expectations. In the long run, these aspects will help us keep training & orientation costs down"

But unfortunately, the referral program is failing miserably in coming years and the hotel is desperately short of staff .To acknowledge the problem, finally the management developed a new position i.e. Director of recruiting. You have been hired for this position and asked to prepare a recruitment plan those solves labour supplies problems that your hotel has been facing over the past few years. However,  your  first  problem  is  to  convince  HR  director  of  the  need  for  a recruitment program.

## ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING

The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## PREFACE

We have put in lots of hard work to make this book as userfriendly as possible, but we have not sacrificed quality. Experts were involved in preparing the materials. However, concepts are explained in easy language for you. We  have included many tables and examples for easy understanding.

We sincerely hope this book will help you in every way you expect. All the best for your studies from our team!

## MICE TOURISM

## Block Introduction :

Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions. The  acronym  MICE  is applied inconsistently with the "E" sometimes referring to events and the "C" sometimes referring to conventions. MICE is used to refer to a particular type of tourism in which large groups, usually planned well in advance, are brought together for some particular purpose. Recently, there has been an industry trend towards using the term meetings industry to avoid confusion from the acronym. Other industry educators are recommending the use of "Events Industry" to be an umbrella term for the vast scope of the meeting and events profession.

Most components of MICE are well understood, perhaps with the exception of incentives. Incentive tourism is usually undertaken as a type of employee reward by a company or institution for targets met or exceeded, or a job well done. Unlike the other types of MICE tourism, incentive tourism is usually conducted purely for entertainment, rather than professional or educational purposes.

MICE tourism usually includes a well-planned agenda centred on a particular theme or topic, such as profession trade organization, a special interest group or an educational topic. Such tourism is often a specialized area with its own exhibition. (e.g. : IMEX, EIBTM, GIBTM, AIBTM, CIBTM and AIME) and practices. Location of MICE events are normally bid on by specialized convention bureaux located in particular countries and cities and established for the purpose of bidding on MICE activities. This process of marketing and bidding is normally conducted well in advance of the actual event, often several years. MICE tourism is known for its extensive planning and demanding clientele.

Leisure, or free time, is time spent away from business, work and domestic chores. It is also the periods of time before or after necessary activities such as eating, sleeping and, where it is compulsory, education.

The distinction between leisure and unavoidable activities is loosely applied, i.e. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility. A distinction may also be drawn between free time and leisure. For example, Situations International maintains that free time is illusory and rarely free; economic and social forces appropriate free time from the individual and sell it back to them as the commodity known as "leisure". In this block, unit 1 discuses recreation and unit 2 takes an in depth look at meetings, incentives conventions and expositions.

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Recreation is any activity people choose to do during their leisure or free time for the fun, pleasure or satisfaction it provides. Recreation is better known as an act of diversion : an activity that diverts, amuses, refreshes or stimulates the mind, body and soul.

Recreation  planning  is  a  people-oriented  process  that  brings  together information about the rational allocation of recreation and sport resources to meet the present and future requirements of people at state, regional and local level.

Recreation therapy is the use of leisure activity to achieve a treatment goal. Therapeutic activities can include art, friendship development, dance, outdoor experiences, therapeutic sports, and more. Recreation therapy can be done in many different settings, such as hospitals, rehabilitation centres, nursing homes, community parks departments and independent living centres.

Introduction  to Hospitality Management

Outdoor recreational activities are undertaken in a natural environment and these  activities  include  an  educational  process  that  facilitates  leadership, interpersonal and management skills. The possibilities for recreational activities in India are enormous.

While leisure is more likely a form of entertainment or rest, recreation is active and participatory, but in a refreshing and diverting manner. As people in the world's wealthier regions lead increasingly sedentary life styles, the need for recreation  has  grown.  The  rises  of  so  called  indoor  recreational  activities exemplify this.

The amount of leisure time at the disposal of the average person has increased significantly as the workweek has shortened. Management of recreation pursuits is now a thriving business field, and trained professionals in recreation are finding many career options open to them.

## 1.2 RECREATION  :

As post-industrial revolution, the society has become more complex, life has become more stressed. Compared to a generation ago, the stress levels of business executives is much higher. The term burned-out-and indeed, the' word stress- have only become a part of our everyday vocabulary in recent years. Recreation is all about creating a balance, a harmony in life that will maintain wellness and wholeness.

Recreation allows people to have fun together, engage themselves in such activities  which  relax  them  and  to  form  lasting  relationships  built  on  the experiences  they  have  enjoyed  together.  This  recreational  process  is  called bonding. Bonding is hard to describe, yet the experience of increased interpersonal feeling for friends or business associates, as a result of recreational pursuit is common. These relationships help in solving personal as well as professional problems.

Recreation is a process that seeks to establish an environment which can lead to happiness. Happiness and well being, therefore, are incidental outcomes of recreation.

## 1.2.1 Public Recreation and Parks Agencies :

During the early part of the nineteenth century in the United States, the parks movement expanded rapidly as a responsibility of government and voluntary organizations.  By  the  early  1900s,  fourteen  cities  had  made  provisions  for supervised play facilities, and the playground movement (here the children of neighbourhood can gather together and perform certain play activities) gained momentum. Private initiative and financial support were instrumental in convincing city government to provide tax dollars to build and maintain new play areas.

Increasingly, the concept that city governments should provide recreation facilities, programs and services became widely accepted. Golf course swimming pools, bathing beaches, picnic areas, winter sports facilities, game, fields and playgrounds were constructed. In other word, the provision of selected recreationrelated products or services by a governmental or non-profit organization in a commercial manner, with much or all of the costs covered by fees, charges, or other non-tax revenues."

## 1.2.2 Commercial Recreation / Non Commercial Recreation :

Recreation Management was developed in the 1920 and 1930s, when recreation and social programs were offered as a community service, Colleges and universities began offering degree programs. Both public and private sector recreation management has grown rapidly since 1950.

Commercial  recreation  has  been  defined  as  "recreation  for  which  the consumer pays and for which the supplier expects to make a profit". "Commercial recreation includes theme parks, attractions and clubs" and non commercial recreations are community gardens, public libraries' etc. Primary function is the provision of retail products and entertainment; including sporting goods, theme/ amusement/water parks, movie theatres, sport/fitness/health clubs, golf courses and country clubs.

## 1.4 LEISURE  :

Leisure or free time is a period of time spent out of work and essential domestic activity. It is also the period of recreational and discretionary time before or after compulsory activities such as eating and sleeping, going to work or running a business, attending school and doing homework, household chores and day-to-day stress.

The  distinction  between  leisure  and  compulsory  activities  is  loosely applied, i.e. people sometimes do work-oriented tasks for pleasure as well as for long-term utility. Distinction may also arise between free time and leisure. For example, criticism of consumer capitalism by the Situations International maintains that free time is illusory and rarely free and instead, economic and social forces appropriate it from the individual and sell it back to him as a commodity in the form of leisure.

Modern life is a busy life. The pace of life gets faster and faster every day and a man must hurry and utilize every moment of his life, otherwise he would be left behind in the race of life. But some leisure is necessary for the happiness of life. There can be no happiness for a man, unless he gets some time to pass in the way he likes best. Leisure may also be passed with great profit in the making of beautiful things. There was a time when the Indian skilled worker used to make beautiful carpets, baskets, toys, etc., in his leisure time, but now this art has been lost. Many of the Indian farmers and workers today are faced with problem of enforced leisure (unemployment) but they fail to use it rightly for the own good and for the good of society. They are advised to use their time in making traditional articles as their forefathers used to do. Similarly, the educated may take to some hobby which would both entertain them and make them more cultured. For example, they may do painting or the study of standard works of literature, more specially poetry. Gardening is another of the finest uses of leisure; the way in which a man passes his leisure is the test of his education. A really educated man would pass it in such cultural act ivies as give pleasure and lead to self- development as well Indians, generally, misuse their leisure, for the education they receive is bookish and does not make them intellectually curious. They are not eager to know and to do; they have not been educated in the real sense of the word. A leisure study is the academic discipline concerned with the study and analysis of leisure.

Leisure or free time is a period of time spent out of work and essential domestic activities. It is also the period of recreational and discretionary time before or after compulsory activities such as eating and sleeping, going to work or running a business, attending school and doing homework, household chores, and day-to-day stress. Leisure activities refresh mind and brings positive flow of energy. Leisure activities are of 2 types

- · Active leisure activities : such activities include mental or physical strength of an individual. e. g. dancing, trekking etc.
- · Passive leisure activities : where the body and mind is allowed to rest e.g. watching a movie.
- · As per the need and availability of the activities, one can choose the activity to serve the purpose of recreation.

##  Entertainment Habits of Indian Youth :

The spending of leisure rightly is an art, and a difficult art. It must be spent in activities which require some, "doing", some acting, some use of the brain. The correct way of passing leisure is to acquire culture, to make and contemplate beautiful things. During holidays, one may go out on picnics, as is done in the west, and thus get an opportunity of enjoying the beauty and freshness of nature. Picnics are health giving and provide the much needed change so essential for health and well-being. They refresh the mind and make it forget for the time being the prosaic cares and worries of this sorry life of ours. They provide the much needed touch of poetry in one's life. They increase efficiency and send back a man to his work with greater enthusiasm and energy.

The youth readership survey by National Book Trust (NBT) and National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) estimates that India's youth population  (13-35  years)  is  about  459  million  (2009).  The  literate  youth population is 333 million.

## 2.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Discuss Meetings
- · Explain Convention
- · State Exhibition and Exposition
- · Discuss Off premise catering
- · Give examples of event Management

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION  :

A meeting is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement. Meetings may occur face to face or virtually,  as  mediated  by  communications  technology,  such  as  a  telephone conference call, a Skype conference call (Skype is a software application that allows users to make voice calls over the Internet.) or a videoconference (A videoconference or video conference also known as a video tele-conference is a set of interactive telecommunication technologies which allow two or more locations to interact via two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously).

Thus, a meeting may be distinguished from other gatherings, such as a chance encounter (not convened), a sports game or a concert (verbal interaction is incidental), a party or the company of friends (no common goal is to be

achieved) and a demonstration (whose common goal is achieved mainly through the number of demonstrators' present, not verbal interaction).

A convention, in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest. Conventions are often planned and coordinated, often in exacting detail, by professional meeting and convention planners, either by staff of the convention's hosting  company  or  by  outside  specialists.  Most  large  cities  will  have  a convention centre dedicated to hosting such events. The term MICE - meetings Incentives Conventions and Exhibitions - is widely used in Asia as a description of the industry.

The  chapter  compiles  various  segments  of  meetings  and  convention planners,  conferences.  It  also  informs  about  the  current  market  trends  of conventions, meetings, and conferences and outdoor exposures including food and staff management. Further it is providing the complete idea of specialized services of outdoor function managements, event management. There are various ways to arrange these functions effectively and smoothly. In detail it has been elaborated how to fulfil these requirement of current market trends, to build goodwill of an organization, methodologies to follow for trainings staff, and specialized personnel.

## 2.2 MEETINGS  :

Meetings are primarily conducted by either the corporate or non-profit industries. Corporations in the medical, financial, and entertainment fields hold an extensive number of meetings-both for their employees and the public. As well meetings are held for the purposes of education, training and decision-making research,  change,  sales,  team  building,  new  product  introduction,  problem solving, strategy or reorganization.

Meetings are often held as a marketing tool as well as a revenue source by associations, non-profit entities, museums, performing arts organizations and educational institution.

Meetings are held for communication, which should be both way, but if the communication is one way, then the same information can be passed on in the form of memos, notices etc, which will be circulated within the organization.

-  Requirements of a Good Meeting :
- 1. Set Objective for the Meeting : One benefit of setting objectives for the meeting is to help you plan the meeting. The more concrete your meeting objectives, the more focused your agenda will be. A second important benefit of having specific objectives for each meeting is that you have a concrete measure against which you can evaluate that meeting. Were you successful in meeting the objectives ? Why or why not ? Is another meeting

Meetings,  Incentives, Conventions  and Exhibition

## Introduction  to Hospitality Management

required ? Setting meeting objectives allows you to continuously improve your effective meeting process.

- 2. Provide an Agenda Beforehand : Provide all participants with an agenda before the meeting starts. Your agenda needs to include a brief description of the meeting objectives, a list of the topics to be covered and a list stating who will address each topic and for how long. When you send the agenda, you should include the time, date and location of the meeting and any background information participants will need to know to hold an informed discussion on the meeting topic. What's the most important thing you should do with your agenda ? Follow it closely!
- 3. Assign Meeting Preparation : Give all participants something to prepare for the meeting, and that meeting will take on a new significance to each group member. For problem- solving meetings, have the group read the background information necessary to get down to business in the meeting. Ask each group member to think of one possible solution to the problem to get everyone thinking about the meeting topic. For example, to start a sales meeting on a positive note, have all participants recall their biggest success since the last meeting and ask one person to share his success with the group.
- 4. Assign Action Items : Don't finish any discussion in the meeting without deciding how to act on it. Listen for key comments that flag potential action items and don't let them pass by without addressing them during your meeting.  Statements  such  as  We  should  really…,  that's  a  topic  for  a different meeting…, or I wonder if we could… are examples of comments that should trigger action items to get a task done, hold another meeting or further examine a particular idea. Assigning tasks and projects as they arise during the meeting means that your follow-through will be complete. Addressing off-topic statements during the meeting in this way also allows you  to  keep  the  meeting  on  track.  By  immediately  addressing  these statements with the suggestion of making an action item to examine the issue outside of the current meeting, you show meeting participants that you value their input as well as their time.
- 5. Examine Your Meeting Process : Assign the last few minutes of every meeting as time to review the following questions : What worked well in this meeting ? What can we do to improve our next meeting ? Every participant should briefly provide a point-form answer to these questions. Answers  to  the  second  question  should  be  phrased  in  the  form  of  a suggested action.

## 2.3 MEETING PLANNERS :

Meeting planners may be independent contractors who contract out their services to both associations and corporations as the need arises or they may be full-time employees of corporations or associations. In either case, meeting planners have interesting careers.

<!-- image -->

The  professional  meeting  planner  not  only  makes  hotel  and  meeting bookings but also plans the meeting down to the last minute, always remembering to check to ensure that the services contracted for have been delivered. In recent years, the technical aspects of audiovisual and simultaneous translation equipment have added to the complexity of meeting planning.

## 2.4 SEATING ARRANGEMENTS :

Problem Solving : With the high-level of interaction required for group problem solving, seating must reflect equality. Equal contribution of ideas is easier when people are seated in a circular pattern. Avoid positioning someone at the head of the table or the top of the room - an indirect placement of power. Round table arrangements foster a feeling of contribution for all meeting participants.

<!-- image -->

Training : Like presenters, the trainer needs to be visually accessible to the training participants. Because most trainers today desire participation from class members, openness is important here too. Set up a U-shaped arrangement to promote equality and interaction. Place visuals at the opening of the U. This configuration allows the trainer to move freely throughout the group members and work one-onone with individuals.

## 2.6 EXHIBITION AND EXPOSITION :

An exhibition is an organized presentation and display of a selection of items.  In  practice,  exhibitions  usually  occur  within  museums,  galleries  and exhibition halls. Exhibitions may be permanent displays or temporary, but in common usage, "exhibitions" are considered temporary and usually scheduled to open and close on specific dates. While many exhibitions are shown in just one venue, some exhibitions are shown in multiple locations, such exhibitions are called travelling exhibitions.

Commercial exhibitions, generally called trade fairs, trade shows or expos, are usually organized so that organizations in a specific interest or industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products; some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade) and members of the press.

The exhibition industry has also gained fresh impetus with exhibition centres like Pragati Maidan in New Delhi, the Nehru Centre in Mumbai and the Chennai Trade Centre in Chennai amongst several other options.

Exposition-A  trade  fair  (trade  show,  trade  exhibition  or  expo)  is  an exhibition organized so that companies in a specific industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products, service, study activities of rivals and examine recent market trends and opportunities. In contrast to consumer fairs, only some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade, e.g. professionals) and members of the press, therefore trade shows are classified as either "Public" or "Trade Only". A few fairs are hybrids of the two; one example is the Frankfurt Book Fair, which is trade-only for its first three days and open to the general public on its final two days. They are held on a continuing basis in virtually all markets and normally attract companies from around the globe.

##  Common characteristics of an exhibition and an exposition :

- · Exhibitions are one of the most effective mediums for establishing and maintaining customer relations.
- · Exhibitions offer an unparalleled and economic opportunity to showcase the existing products and services, launch new products or enter new markets.
- · They play the major part in product marketing.
- · They provide the opportunity for large numbers of buyers and sellers (from multinational companies to small entrepreneur) in an industry to come into direct contact with each other in one place at the same time.
- · Exhibitions  cater  to  mass  exposure,  which  enables  to  reach  a  large proportion of the marketplace in a short space of time.
- · Expositions create high profile, highly targeted business and consumer exhibitions, where buyers and suppliers from around the world can come together to do business.

##  Trends in Conventions, Meetings and Expositions :

- · Globalization/international participation : More people are going abroad to attend meetings.
- · The cloning of shows : Some international shows do not travel very well (i.e. agricultural machinery). Thus, organizations such as Blenheim or Reed Exposition Group lift components and create shows in other countries.
- · Competition  :  Competitiveness  has  increased  among  all  destinations. Convention centres will expand and new centres will come on-line.
- · Technology : The industry needs to be more sophisticated. The need for fibre optics is present everywhere.
- · Shows are growing at a rate of 5 to 10 percent per year.
- · The costs are increasing which hinders the growth of this sector as the companies also need to hike up their budgets.
- · Systematic marketing of convention venues is the need of the time.

## 2.7 OFF  PREMISE  CATERING  :

Off-premise catering is serving food at a location away from the caterer's food  production  facility.  One  example  of  a  food  production  facility  is  a freestanding commissary, which is a kitchen facility used exclusively for the preparation of foods to be served at other locations. Other examples of production facilities include, but are not limited to, hotel, restaurant and club kitchens. In most cases there is no existing kitchen facility at the location where the food is served. Off- premise catering can mean serving thousands of box lunches to a group of conventioneers; to serving an elegant dinner for two aboard a luxury

## Meetings,  Incentives, Conventions  and Exhibition

Introduction  to Hospitality Management

yacht, or providing food, staff and equipment for an upscale fundraiser with hundreds of guests.

##  Advantages of off-premises catering :

- · There is no need for large amounts of capital to get started, since most off premise catering operations begin by using the existing kitchen facilities of a restaurant, club, hotel, church or other licensed foodservice business.
- · All  of  the  necessary  catering  foodservice  equipment  such  as  china, glassware, flatware, tables, chairs and linens can usually be rented, thus avoiding having to invest in expensive equipment inventories.
- · Food and supply inventories, as well as operating costs, are much more easily controlled, because clients must advise the caterer in advance as to the number of guests that are expected.
- · Off-premise caterers need buy only the amounts necessary to serve the event, unlike a restaurant where there is a large variation from day to day regarding the number of patrons and their menu selections.
- · Advance forecasting is more accurate for off-premise caterers, because parties are generally booked weeks, months or years in advance.
- · Off-premise events generate tremendous amounts of free word-of-mouth advertising, which can produce future business without the necessity of advertising.
- · Caterers also have the advantage of being somewhat selective about their clients.

##  Disadvantage :

- · Catering managers, owners, and staff undergo periods of high stress during very busy periods. Deadlines must be met. There are no excuses for missing a catering deadline. Stress is compounded because the workload is not evenly  spread  throughout  the  year.  For  most  off-premise  caterers,  80 percent of the events are scheduled in 20 percent of the time. For most, weekends are generally busier than weekdays. Certain seasons, including Christmas, are normally busier than others.
- · The seasonality of the business makes it difficult to find staff at certain times.
- · Revenues  are  inconsistent,  making  cash  management  very  difficult, particularly during the slower periods when expenses continue yet revenues do not.

Off-premise catering managers must make decisions that keep their operations  running  smoothly.  They realize  that  some  decisions  will  be better  than  others,  that  there  is  no perfect solution to every problem and that the best decision-making goal is to find the best possible solution with the least number of drawbacks.

<!-- image -->

##  Guidelines of a manager of an off-premise catering enterprise :

- · Remember that there's seldom only one acceptable solution to the problem. Choose the best alternative.
- · Make decisions that help achieve the company objectives.
- · You need to consider feelings whenever people are involved.
- · Allow quality time for planning and decision making

## 3.2 MICE  TOURISM  IN  INDIA  :

India's impressive variety of history and culture, from the ancient Gigantic Kingdoms to the present state, harmoniously blend to form a unique atmosphere in over a million square kilometres of scenic sights. A continent-sized country, India possesses an amazing wealth of sights and sounds, tastes and textures. From a bustling cosmopolitan city to the quiet countryside, hill station or a beach resort, India has destinations, which offer a backdrop of unmatched beauty for a business meet, will find a fascinating amalgam of tradition and culture, beauty and nature, style and splendour, warmth, feelings and courtesies, comfort and convenience virtually everything the modern conference organiser or delegate could expect. Conferences here bring fresh meaning of the concept of combining work with pleasure.

What makes India different from any other destination is the myriad of experiences that it offers. This is one land where the ancient and the modern coexist. India has literally everything that a visitor wants to experience and offers people a complete holiday both physical and mental. This is perhaps the reason why we have so many repeat visitors. To quote Mark Twain, "India is the cradle of the human race, the birthplace of human speech, the mother of history, the grandmother of legend and the great grandmother of tradition. Our most valuable and most instructive materials in the history of man are treasured up in India." Amidst the countless ways that India can capture world attention as a tourist paradise, there also exists a dynamic business opportunity as a splendid venue for international conferences and conventions of no less than global standards.

## 3.2.1 India - A Hot MICE Destination :

MICE - the new form of business tourism is the fastest growing section of  the  International  tourism  market.  It  caters  to  various  forms  of  business meetings, International conferences and conventions, events and exhibitions and is  slowly  but  steadily  capturing  every  big  hotelier's  attention.  Being  a  hot favourite tourist destination, India is also very much into the business. After the hot-spots like Hong Kong, Malaysia and Dubai, India is fast gaining its pace in the  competition  to  become  an  ideal  MICE  destination.  With  the  advanced technology and facilities, warm hospitality, personalized services coupled with immense natural beauty and rich cultural heritage, the goal seems to be not very far. MICE tourism is the new buzzword in the international tourist market and relates to various business groups and individual travellers.

The importance of the MICE industry lies in the fact that it converts the annual business meetings and conferences into a glamorous and enjoyable event for the delegates and attendants. Be it a meeting to bring people together either from  within  one  company  or  from  a  broader  spectrum  or  an  international conference of 100 delegates or product launch party or exhibition, MICE tourism finds itself being inevitable in all the occasions. To grow the business tourism in India, the country boasts of some world-class convention centres. The Ashok, New Delhi; Hyderabad International Convention Centre, Hyderabad; Le Méridien,

Cochin are forerunner in the Indian MICE tourism facilitating both domestic and International level of business meetings and conferences. Enchanting India's image as a conference destination is also projected through the chains of Hotels, providing international standards in facilities and services. Exclusive business hotels and exotic resorts, with meeting rooms of distinction, spacious convention facilities, modern business centres and a wide range of conference facilities.

India is in a continual process of upgrading its MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) facilities. There are multiple plans on the anvil for more world-class convention centres, airports that contest with the best in the world and efforts to team the famous Indian hospitality with customisation as per a visitor's requirement. One could also offer the credit to the world class incentive

programs,  her  ability  to  heal spiritually,  her  unmatched offering as a health destination or continually improved infrastructure facilities that over 3  million  foreign  tourists thronged her this year generating over US $30 billion as revenue, even  as  most  other  preferred hotspots marked a decline in their tourism graphs.

India is undoubtedly a unique Conference Destination as it offers cultural and heritage sites, the exotic and mystical, excellent facilities of beach and adventure holidays which can be combined as pre and post conference tours.

The inbound MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and events) segment is growing at 15 to 20% annually. It is estimated that the total national and international MICE meetings market all over the world is in excess of $270 billion.  The  Infrastructure  -  India  provides  an  impressive  combination  of accommodation  and  other  conference  support  facilities  to  hold  a  successful Conference. To mention a few; Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi, Centre Point, Renaissance Hotel and Convention Centre in Mumbai, the BM Birla Science and Technology Centre in Jaipur, The Jaypee Hotels and International Convention Centre, Agra and the Cochin Convention Centre, Kochi etc together with facilities in the business hotels and resorts at various centres in the country.

India is going the global way and MICE is fast becoming a major part of its travel and promotional budgets. In the Indian context, incentives is at present the largest component of MICE but in a maturing market, it's only a matter of time before the entire gamut of MICE activities are undertaken by the Indian corporate world. With the expansion in the network of airlines operation on the domestic routes, better tourist surface transport systems including the Indian Railways, new centres of information technology, many new convention centres, hotels and meeting facilities, India is now an important MICE destination. The Indian sub- continent is emerging as one of the finest Incentive destinations in the world owing to the diverse culture and geography. From the icy Himalayas to the tropical islands and from citadels in the desert to verdant jungles it is a world in itself. With the emergence of exciting new destinations every year one has unparalleled choices for the incentive operator here. The incentive programmes are a combination of old world charm and tradition interlaced with modern cosmopolitan sophistication.

Today, there are distinct travel divisions within tour companies and airlines that exclusively target MICE movement. Destinations have also begun to market MICE products to specialised agencies and the corporate world at large. The business of MICE holds enormous potential for any country. It is estimated that a person travelling to a country for a conference or convention spends anywhere four to eight times more than a normal leisure traveller. They spend more on food, more on business centre services.

India is globally connected to a network of over 50 international airlines and several domestic airlines, which provide convenient connectivity within India.

## 3.3 EVENT MANAGEMENT :

The management of events requires coordination, from stage one. The first thing required is to get the orders for the event. This process is also known as pitching for an event. Usually, whether it is for small time events (birthday parties and weddings), or then for the larger ones assigned by companies (exhibitions and trade fairs), or then the international concerts; the event manager/company is asked to submit a project report, with the finances involved. On the basis of this is the assignment given to them.

Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development of festivals, events and conferences. Event management involves studying the qualities of the brand, identifying the target audience, devising the event concept, planning the logistics and coordinating the technical aspects before actually executing the modalities of the proposed event. Post-event analysis and ensuring a return on investment have become significant drivers for the event industry. Events and festivals, such as the sporting events like Asian Games, Pushkar cattle fair(Rajasthan), award winning functions like Film fare award or religious  celebrations  like  GanpatiUtsav,  Dassera,  KumbhMela  have  a  large impact on their communities and, in some cases, the whole country.

## 3.3.2 Requisites of a Good Event :

- · Knowledge is power : In order to make an event successful, understanding and knowledge is crucial. No two events are the same and understanding the nuances of what is required for a particular event is crucial. Events such as corporate meetings have their own demands of protocol and procedures. Entertainment  events  such  as  concerts  require  knowledge  of  various supporting resources to be put in place. Before actually commencing with managing an event, do make sure that you understand what exactly needs to be done. Talk to people who have participated in such events before, talk to other people who have managed such events before, keep yourself constantly updated with the evolving dynamics of each type of event.
- · Set the Stage : What is perfect for a few persons may turn out to be a claustrophobic experience for a hundred. It is very important to know the number of people who are expected to attend the event beforehand. Make sure the customer has intimated his requirements to you clearly. The choice of the venue will depend on this factor. Very often the decisionto choose a venue is taken jointly with the customer. After the venue is chosen it is essential to obtain maps, scout the location and take notes.
- · Prepare today, execute tomorrow : Once a high level understanding of what needs to be done is obtained, it's time for the planning phase. Chalk up a planof which actions to be taken, and when. Assign responsibilities to the various actors within you team. Track the progress of each such planned action to completion. Before a big event, it is crucial to conduct dry runs and simulations. If possible, do involve the customer in such a dry run and walk him through of what he may expect during the actual event. This will prevent unpleasant surprises.
- · Time it Right : When planning an event, work out a plausible time span. No event should be hurried, hectic affair and neither should it be a long drawn affair which puts the audience's patience under test. The agenda should be well balanced, with adequate time contingencies built in.
- · Tools  of  the  trade  : It is also very important to have a grasp over the technicalities that run the show. Arrangement of proper technical equipment and  skilled  technicians  is  of  prime  importance.  Nothing  can  be  more embarrassing than a piece of equipment malfunctioning in the middle of the show. Pay attention to detail - for example when two projectors are beaming simultaneously on two ends of the stage, they must be in sync and

have the same colour balance. Have the technicians check and recheck the equipments before the show starts.

- · Rules  are  not  always  meant  to  be  broken  : Organizing an event also requires number of approvals, permissions and procedures to be obtained. These range from permission from the police, civic authority clearances, environmental clearances etc. Make sure you, or your customer, have sought and obtained all necessary approvals and permissions. Stick within the boundaries of the provisions during the event. Never ever make the mistake of landing up in the wrong side of the law.
- · Teamwork : An event involves a number of players. In some large scale events, it is mind boggling to think of the sheer number of players involved. For example, in a music concert - musicians, sound technicians, light technicians,  stage  technicians,  sponsors,  celebrities  and  of  course  the general audience are involved. Each of these parts has to function smoothly in  order  for  the  whole  to  work.  Communication  is  the  key.  Frequent meetings, briefings and rehearsals are needed for everyone to understand what their responsibilities are and how they need to coordinate. During the event have effective communication and coordination mechanisms like wireless headsets, or cell phones.
- · Backup plan : In spite of the intricate planning, rehearsals and the best of your efforts, things may not always run smoothly and last minute glitches can occur. Do not panic - be prepared for such exigencies. Have a backup plan in place. Arrange for emergency power backups and other technical backup systems. If an inordinate delay occurs (for example a performing artist does not show up on time), plan in advance how to handle the situation and keep the audience occupied.
- · Safety is important : While it is important to have fun, safety is a very important factor. Ensure that emergency exits are well marked and that you have adequate trained personnel to handle the situation in case anything untoward happens. Have the fire brigade and paramedical ready in case of very large events.
- · Attitude : Last but not the least, always remembers that managing an event is all about interacting with people to deliver the best results. Keep a cheerful and positive disposition - it lowers stress for everyone concerned. The customer is always right - some things may not always go your liking, but in the end your satisfaction would come from seeing the event getting executed perfectly.

## The Incredible India Campaign

Indian government regularly formulated different policies and prepared brochures for the promotion of tourism in India; however, it did not support tourism as it should be. Because of that our country attracted very few tourists from other countries. In 2002, the tourism ministry made a specific effort to bring in more professionalism in tourism industry in its attempts to promote tourism in India. The tourism ministry hired the services of Ogilvy & Mather (India) (O&M) to create a new campaign to increase tourist inflows into the country. The 'Incredible India' campaign, as it was named, was launched in 2002 with a series of television commercials and print advertisements. This campaign had a great impact in attracting tourists from around the world.

After starting this new campaign, Visa Asia Pacific in March 2006, India released spending data by tourists and India is emerged as the fastest-growing market in the Asia-Pacific in terms of international tourist spending. This data disclosed that international tourists spent US$ 372 million in India in the fourth quarter (October-December) of 2005, 25% more than in the fourth quarter of 2004. China, which came second in the region in relation with the growth in spending by international tourist, was successful in making international tourists spend US$ 784 million in fourth quarter of 2005, a growth of 23% over its fourth quarter of 2004 figures.

Though India was able to earn only around half of what China earned, still growth of international spending in India is more than China in spite of attracting only a fraction of the number of tourists than our neighbour managed to lure, indicated that the campaign had been successful in achieving its objectives.
