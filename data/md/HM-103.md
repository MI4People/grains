## 1.1 Introduction

The guestroom is the main product of a hotel, as it contributes to more than 50 per cent of the total sales, making the profit percentage from room sales very high. The ‗sale'  of  a  room  means  leasing  the  room  for  occupation  for  24  hours  at  a  predetermined cost. Thus, a room sold on a particular day earns revenue for that day, and then  it  can  be  sold  again,  and  again.  Rooms  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‗highly perishable commodities' as rooms not sold for the day lose out on the revenue for that day.  In  addition  to  earning  revenues,  guestrooms  also  have  a  role  in  the  imagebuilding of the hotel. Guests may stay in a hotel for pleasure, convenience, or from necessity. Whatever the reason for the stay, the will always expect a certain standard of  service  and  comfort.  It  is  hence  essential  for  each  and  every  hotel  employee  to understand  the  importance  of  a  guestroom  for  a  guest.  The  housekeeping  staff,  in particular, has the responsibility of making the guestroom ‗a home away from home' for the guest.

The aim of all Hotels or establishments that offer accommodation is to provide their customers with clean, attractive, comfortable and welcoming surroundings that offer

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

value for money. Nothing sends a stronger message than cleanliness in a hospitality industry. No level of service, friendliness or glamour can equal the sensation a guest has upon entering a spotless, tidy and conveniently arranged room. Both management and guest consider keeping the place clean and in good order a necessity, for a hotel to command a fair price and to get repeat business.

A survey carried out showed 63% travelers rated cleanliness and appearance as their first priority in their choice of hotels. The housekeeping department takes pride in keeping the hotel clean and comfortable so as to create a ‗home away from home'. Good  housekeeping  is  considered  as  the  backbone  of  accommodation  sector  as  its main  aim  is  to  provide  a  clean  comfortable,  safe  and  aesthetically  appealing environment.

Housekeeping is an operational department of the hotel. It is responsible for cleanliness,  maintenance,  aesthetic  upkeep  of  rooms,  public  areas,  back  areas  and surroundings.

A hotel survives on the sale of rooms, food, beverage, and other minor services like laundry, health clubs, health spa, sightseeing, shopping arcades etc. The sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 50% of these sales.

Thus a major part of hotels margin of profit comes from room sales because a room once made can be sold over and over again. However, the days when the room remains  unsold  there  is  a  total  loss  of  revenue.  To  this  extent,  rooms  are  more perishable  than  food.  The  housekeeping  budget  typically  accounts  for  20%  of  the properties  total  operating  expenditure.  The  largest  element  of  operating  cost  in  the housekeeping  department  is  labour.  The  effort  that  the  housekeeping  department makes in giving a guest a desirable room has a direct bearing on the guest experience in the hotel.

Guest rooms are the heart of the hotel. Unless the décor is appropriate, the air odour free, furnishing and upholstery is spotlessly clean the hotel may loose a guest as a  potential  customer.  The  housekeeping  department  not  only  prepares  the  clean guestroom  on  a  timely  basis  for  the  guests  who  are  arriving  but  also  cleans  and maintains everything in the hotel so that the property is fresh and attractive as the day it  opens  for  business.  The  housekeeping  thus  contributes  in  a  big  way  towards  the overall  reputation  of  a  property.  It  is  a  24  hour  and  365  day  operation.  Scientific housekeeping demands the employment of the most effective cleaning materials and procedures, attention to  purchasing the most suitable linen supplies, maintenance of decorative area under the housekeeping department purview and proper organization and supervision.

Other than hotels, professional housekeeping service is very much in demand in  hospitals,  cooperate  buildings,  airports,  airlines,  cruisers,  banks  shopping  arcade. Since  most  such  organizations  prefer  to  outsource  these  functions,  contract housekeeping is becoming a lucrative entrepreneurship venture these days.

Brand  loyalty: Resident  guest  may  be  loyal  to  a  particular  chain  of  hotels  or properties. E g. Holiday Inn, Hyatt, etc. Change of brand loyalty can be explained as a matter of habit, maximization of value to price or past experience with service since it is  difficult  to  explain  pre  purchased  information  about  services.  Consumers  may  be reluctant  to  change  brands  as  they  are  uncertain.  Guest  also  become  brand  loyal  as they  realize  that  repeat  patronage  to  a  particular  property  gives  them  personalize service  and  greater  satisfaction  of  their  needs.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  guest  is recognized as his needs are known by the staff.

Decreasing brand loyalty may be due to:

-  The availability of individual brands only in certain locations. This forces the client  to  choose  another  brand.  In  this  way  the  consumer  learns  about competing brands and is able to make a more realistic evaluation of the kind of brand he would like to patronize.
-  Travel writers give useful tips about different hotels, their services and comfort of stay.
-  Travel agents also help in giving information about different hotels.
-  Trade magazines often do monthly assessments of different hotels.

## 1.5 Importance of the Guestrooms to a Guest

It is extremely important to understand the expectations of a guest when he/she pays to  stay  in  a  room.  People  nowadays  travel  a  lot  more  than  they  did  earlier,  and  the expectations  from  hotels  are  constantly  on  the  rise.  In  such  a  scenario,  continuous analysis of guest expectations becomes necessary. Given that a hotel is often referred

to as ‗a home away from home', there would be similarities in a guest's expectations from a hotel and from a home. These similarities would dictate that the guestrooms be neat,  hygienic,  comfortable,  private,  and  above  all,  safe.  The  most  important consideration  here  is  staff  needs  to  understand  and  respect  the  guest's  expectations from the guestroom and the hotel staff.

Primarily, a neat room is the basic minimum expectation of any guest, and the staff needs to ensure this by laying out fresh linen and presenting a clean room on a daily  basis.  The  room  should  not  only  be  attractive,  but  also  comfortable  and functional.  Hotel  guests  expect  a  high  degree  of  cleanliness,  leading  to  a  hygienic environment to stay in. For instance, guest that the hotel has provided them a sanitized toilet when they see a disinfected paper strip on the toilet seat. The ‗basic necessities' in a guestroom are constantly varying. Nowadays these may include Internet and WiFi connectivity, channel music, television, temperature control, and so on. Guests also expect that they will not be disturbed often and that the location of the rooms would be such that they have a good view. Safety, as we have already mentioned, is a key factor with regard to guestrooms - guest would like the guestroom location to be safe and  not  accessible  to  one  and  all.  The  doors  of  a  guestroom  should  have  a  double locking system operable from inside, along with strict control measures in the hotel with regard to the handling of guestroom keys and master keys. Fire-exit layouts being placed  in  the  rooms  is  a  necessity  as  well.  Irrespective  of  its  location,  a  guestroom should  also  offer  easy  access  to  other  guest  service  areas,  such  as  restaurants, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and so on, with clear directions to and from the room or elevator being posted in corridors.

The  guest  would  also  expect  to  be  able  to  get  in  touch  with  ancillary departments  providing  other  services  to  guests  from  the  room  itself.  The  various services- such as room service, restaurants, housekeeping, valet, and so on- should be clearly indicated with explanation and intercom numbers in the literature on the house rules and in the information kits placed in each guestroom.

## 1.6 Areas of responsibility of housekeeping department

Guestrooms / Floors : Room attendants and floor supervisors are responsible for the cleanliness maintenance and security of guestrooms and surrounding areas.

Public  Areas: Front  of  the  house  areas  (E.g.  swimming  pools,  parking  area,  club, food service area etc.)

Laundry:  OPL  (On  Premises  Laundry): If  the  laundry  is  on  premises  then  the guest laundry from the rooms is directly collected and delivered by the laundry ballet. However all hotel linen is first collected in the linen room and then sent to the laundry for  washing.  OPL (off premises laundry) is the laundry of both the  guest and linen

which  is  done  by  the  external  laundry.  All  the  linen  including  the  guest  laundry  is collected in  the  linen  room  from  it  is  sent  to  the  external  laundry  for  washing.  The washed linen including the guest laundry is collected at the linen from where it is sent to the guest rooms and other service points.

Resident Guests: They are given their service by room attendance and they are not charged for it. Some hotels have a shoeshine machine in the corridor.

Florist: It could either be given out for contract or be a part of the responsibility of the housekeeping  department.  An  employee  of  the  housekeeping  department  would  be required  to  do  the  flower  arrangements  in  the  lobby,  guestrooms,  restrooms, restaurants.  Any  banquet  requirements  like  a  backdrop  for  a  wedding  are  done  on contract.

Extra Room Complimentary & Supplies: Iron, first-aid, hot water bags, ice bags, thermometer, hair dryer etc are given out for guest use at no extra cost. However a request for extra beds should be routed through the Front office since the guest would be charged extra for it.

## 1.8    Different Sections in Housekeeping Department

Executive  Housekeeper's  office :  An  Executive  housekeeper  has  to  plan,  counsel, brief and meets her subordinates. It should preferably be a glass paneled office so as to give her / him a view of what is happening outside the office. The office should be leaded  by  a  cabin  for  the  secretary  who  would  control  movement  into  the  house keeper's office.

Desk control  room :  This  room  acts  as  a  nerve  system  center  for  coordination  and communication with the front office and other departments.  The desk  control  room should have a large notice board to pin up staff schedules and day to day instructions. The desk control room is the point where all staff report for duty and check out at the duty end.

Linen room :  This  is  the  room where current linens are stored for issue and receipt. The  room  should  be  large  airy  and  free  from  heat  and  humidity.  It  should  have adequate shelves, easily accessible to stack all linen. It should be secured and offer no possibilities  of  pilferage.  The  linen  room  should  have  a  counter,  across  which  the exchange of linen takes place. The room should preferably be adjoining the laundry so as to supply linen to and from the laundry.

Linen  room  store :  This  room  stores  the  stock  of  new  linen  &  cloth  materials  for uniform, etc. the stock maintained should be enough to replenish the whole hotel at a time.  However,  these  stocks  are  only  touched  when  the  current  linen  in  circulation falls  short  due  to  shortage,  damage  or  loss.  The  room  should  be  cool  and  dry  with ample shelves, generally 6" above the ground.

Uniform room : This room stocks the uniform in urgent use. It is possible that smaller hotel  may  choose  to  combine  the  uniform  room  with  the  linen  room.  A  separate uniform room really depends upon the volume of uniforms in circulation. The only difference  will  be  that  the  uniform  room  would  have  adequate  hanging  facilities  as many uniforms are best maintained when hung.

Tailor's  room :  This  room  is  kept  for  house  tailors  who  attend  to  the  stitching  and patch-up  work  of  linen  and  uniforms.  Room  is  avoided  if  the  mending  and  the stitching jobs are done in contract basis.

Laundry :  This  is  an  important section under housekeeping which is responsible for cleaning of all fabrics used in hotel. The section should be adjacent to linen room so as  to  avoid  excessive  steps.  Laundry  should  ensure  the  cleanness  and  drying  of  all guest clothes, employee uniforms and linen to the best assured standard.

## 1.9 Organizational Structure of Housekeeping Department

Organization  is  a  process  of  identifying  and  grouping  the  work  to  be  performed, defining and delegating responsibility and authority ad establishing relationships for the purpose of enabling people to work more effectively in accomplishing objectives. If the whole establishment has to work as one unit, it is important that there are clear lines  of  authority  and  good  lines  of  communication.  The  organizational  structure  of housekeeping department - whether in a small, medium or large hotel - is depicted using an organization chart.

Commercial/Off-site/Contracted  Laundries: These  cater  to  hotel  on  contractual basis. The contract specifies the rate for laundering different articles of linen, the time taken for laundering and so on. Usually the soiled linen are laundered and delivered back to the hotel within 24-48 hours. The laundries may however hold back 3-5 per cent  of  the  soiled  linen  for  stain  removal  and  other  special  treatments.  Contract laundry are a good option if the hotel does not want to make a heavy investment in setting up its own laundry or has space constraints.

Advantages to the Hotel - The advantages of Contract Laundries are as follows:

-  No capital outlay
-  Little technical expertise required
-  Labour costs are saved

Disadvantages  to  the  Hotel -  The  disadvantages  of  Contract  Laundries  are  as follows:

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

-  Less control over standards
-  Delivery and collection delays
-  Higher  stock  requires  as  it  takes  a  longer  time  for  the  whole  process  to complete a single laundry cycle, including transportation
-  Loss of articles may increase
-  Extra cost for special treatment

On Premises/On-Site/In-House Laundry: An On Premises Laundry (OPL) is hotel's own laundry,  situated  on  its  premises.  It  can  be  run  be  run  by  the  management  or managed on a contract. Many hotels make this heavy investment to provide quality service to guests. More care is taken while laundering in-house since it is the direct responsibility  of  the  hotel.  Services  are  faster,  a  maximum  of  8  hours  to  return laundered articles, hence par stocks are reduced. There is a better supervision, better control and hence a longer life of linen. There are a fewer chances of pilferage since the linen do not leave the premises. However, a contingency plan must be made, to be implemented in case of equipment failure.

Advantages to the Hotel - The advantages of OPLs are as follows:

-  No losses or ‗softfalls' of missing articles are likely to occur
-  Less stock required as the cycle is quicker
-  Can cover emergency requirement
-  Is a capital assest

## Disavantages to the Hotel - The disadvantages of OPLs are as follows:

-  The initial capital investment is high
-  Higher labour cost
-  Technical expertise or special managemnet is required
-  High cost of maintenance, repairs and overheads

Laundromats: These are self service laundries usually found in motels.  Laundromats may be utilised by using coin slots to pay by the load or by making a fixed monthly payment. In some resorts, long-stay guests too can use the equipment.

Planning  an  OPL: The  decision  of  whether  to  include  a  laundry  on  the  premises should ideally be made during the initial planning stage for the facility. If this is not done, considerable cost may be incurred to change the plumbing and electrical system later.  Hot  water,  cold  water,  steam,  gas,  large  sewer  drains  and  water  lines  are essential plumbing considerations. Hot water of temperatures between 160 o Celsius to 180 0 Celsius  should  be  available  for  sanitising  the  machines.  Both  110  volts  (for equipment manufactured in Europe).

Location : The laundry  should,  if  at  all  possible,  be  easily  accessible  from  thelinen room so that heavy bundles of laundry can be easily transported from one location to another. It should be located away from the guest areas, however, because of acoustic reasons,  Vibration  and  Humidity  problems  anticipated  in  a  laundry.  It  should preferably  be  along  the  outside  wall  of  building  to  provide  adequate  venting. Moreover, the laundry should be located so that it can be operated and/or used by both men and women.

Size: The  rule  of  thumb  for  hotel  laundries  is  7sq.ft.  Per  room  (not  including  soil storage).  For  soil  storage,  1  cubic  foot  for  every  3.6kg  (up  to  a  height  of  4  feet)  is

usually allotted, though it is difficult to state an optimum size because of individual institutions' needs.

Ventilation: This is essential to exhaust moisture-Laden air from the dryers outof the laundry room. Laundry room also require adequate ventilation through regular doors or windows to take in a supply of fresh air equal to the air amount of air removed from the room through exhaust fans or similar.

Equipment  section: Laundry  equipment  must  be  considered  to  initial  cost,  life expectancy,  maintenance  and  depreciation.  Overhead  cost  of  utilities  such  as elcetricity , water and gas need to be considered.

Wet laundry must be moved from the washer-cum-extractor to the dryer, while dry laundry must be moved to storage shelves and hence to shower areas and ‗equipment issues' areas. To facilitate these transfers, utility baskets, hampers and carts must be provided. A workable (4ft x 6ft)with castor wheels on the legs is very convenient for folding towels or other laundry. It can be moved about the room as needed too. Tehre shopuld be a cupboards or bins as well, for the storage of detergents, soaps, bleaches and other cleaning agents.

Labour: The rule of thumb for a small institutional laundry is that one person should be able to handle a weight of about 36kg an hour.

Other  Costs: Costs  of  laundry  aids  such  as  soap,  bleach,  detergents  and  other chemicals  should  be  estimated  and  considereation  should  be  given  as  to  how  bulk quantities of other supplies will be stored.

Collecting Soiled Linen: Room attendants; collect the soiled linen in the soiled linen bag, attached to the housekeeping department cart. Putting linen directly into into the soiled linen bag prevents room attendants from using towels, sheets and other items to clean spillage and other dirt. Public area linen are brought to the laundry by respective departments.

Transporting soiled linen to the Laundry: Linen is carried by hand or in a laundry cart. Linen chutes on each floor is also used for transporting of linen.

Sorting: The laundry has a sorting area, large enough to hold and sort a day's linen. Soiled linen is sorted according to the degree of soil and type of fabric. Both types of sorting help to prevent unnecessary wear and damage to linen.

Washing: The  laundry  should  weigh  the  load  before  putting  it  into  a  machine,  to ensure that the machine is not overloaded. Most laundries rely on chemicals, which are used in the machine to clean the linen. Washing consists of nine steps:

- 1. Flush;
- 2. Break;
- 3. Suds;
- 4. Intermediate rinse;
- 5. Bleach;
- 6. Rinse;
- 7. Intermediate extract;
- 8. Sours;
- 9. Extract

Before washing, soaking is done overnight in detergent for heavy soiling.

-  Flush -  This  wets  the  linen  using  little  or  no  chemicals  and  remove  water soluble dirt, medium water temperature is used. This stage takes 1-3 minute extractions also occur.
-  Break -  A  highly  alkaline  soil  loosening  product  is  used  before  the  suds stage.  Used  on  heavily  soiled  linen  only,  medium  water  is  used  for  4-5 minutes.
-  Suds -  This  is  the  actual  wash  cycle  to  which  the  detergent  is  added.  The action  of  detergent  together  with  the  movement  of  the  drum  and  the  water temperature cause the dirt to be removed. This stage take 5-8 minutes.
-  Intermediate  rinse/  carryover  suds -  This  is  the  first  rinsing  stage  which removes  the  soil  and  alkalinity  to  help  bleach  work  more  effectively.  This stage take 2-5 minutes.
-  Bleach -  Bleach  is  popular  laundry  aid  and  helps  detergent  to  remove  soils and  stains.  Through  oxidisation,  Laundry  bleaches  convert  soil  into  more soluble, colourless or dispersible particles than can be removed by detergent and  carried  away  in  the  wash  water.  The  two  general  oxidising  types  are Sodium  Hypochlorite  (also  called  chlorine  or  liquid  household  bleach)  and oxygen. Sodium Hypochlorite oxygen bleaches should not be used together. The  benefits  of  both  are  lost  when  combined.  Colour  removers,  considered reduced bleaches, are also products in the bleaches category. This stage takes 5-8 minutes.
-  Rinse - This is the final rinsing stage where all the detergent, bleaches etc. is removed with the help of water. This stage takes 1.5-3 minutes.
-  Intermediate extract -  High  speed-spin  removes  detergent  and  from  linen. This stage take 1.5-2 minutes.
-  Sour and soft or starch/sizing -  It  is  the  final  conditioning of the linens at medium temperature. Starch is added to stiffen cotton fabric: sizing is added to polyester blend. Starching or sizing replaces the sour softer step. This stage takes 3-5 minutes.
-  Extract -  A  high speed of spin removes excess moisture. Additional cycles may be used. This stage takes 2-12 minutes.
-  Finishing - Finishing gives linen a wrinkle free appearance. A steam cabinet or tunnels are often used to dry the articles to give the fabrics a wrinkle free look.
-  Drying -Items that are generally include towels and washcloths. After drying, the items should be removed immediately and folding.

-  Transporting  lines  to  use  area -After  the  entire  cycle  is  over  the  linen  is returned to the various outlets on a basis of dirty for clean.

Laundry Equipment: Sophisticated machinery is needed in laundries to cope  with the various types of fabrics and other items to be laundered, dried and pressed, given the  huge  amount  of  laundry  to  be  completed  in  a  given  time  period.  The  type  and amount of equipment should be  chosen keeping in mind the amount of linen to be processed by the laundry.

Laundering Equipment: Laundering equipment include washing machines, washercum-centrifuge and extractors, hydro-extractors and dryers.

Washing Machines - Those used in hotel laundries are typically of the tumbler type. There capacities typically  vary  from  7  to  200  kg. The wash barrels of those used in hotels  are  usually  of  stainless steel. Machines with a capacity of 100kg  or  more,  generally  have  a drum  that  has  two  or  three compartments.  These  are  also referred  to  as  ‗Tunnel  Washing Machines'.  The  unit  may  end  loading or front loading.

controlled. Most automatic washing machines have detergent and solution dispensing

Washing machines with microprocessors  are  computer capabilities. The executive housekeeper  should  ensure  that  all maintenance procedures are followed and the machine is used as per instructions.

## Washer-cum-Centrifuge and

Extractors : These machines range in capacity from 7 to 300 kg. They may operate on steam or electricity or even a combination of the two.

Hydro-Extractors: These are large centrifuges, ranging in capacity from  7  to  70  kg.  A  typical  hydroextractor.  The  basket  is  made  of stainless steel. They are electrically operated.  Clothes  from  the  washer are  put  into  a  hydro-extractor  to remove  about  50-75  per  cent  of

Figure 2.22 Washer-Cum-Centrifuge and Extractoe

<!-- image -->

excess water. The water is extracted from the washed linen by means of centrifugal force or by the application of pressure.

Dryers - These are units of tumbler-type equipment meant to remove moisture from damp, tightly packed linen (that have come out of hydro-extractors) by tumbling them in a rotating cylinder through which heated air passes. They are generally used for noiron articles and towels as these linen do not require pressing. The heated air may be produced by electricity, gas or steam.

## Pressing Equipment

## Storing (Ironing)

-  Steam press - These are hand press used for small items.
-  Flat press -  These  are  generally used by hotels that are not able to afford calendaring  machines  to  press  linen  like bed-sheets pillow covers, etc.
-  Suzy's - A Suzie is an inflammable shape on  to  which  folds  e.g.  a  blazer  is  placed
- and which are then filled with steam, so drying  and  pressing  out  creases  of  the blazer.  It  is  also  known  as  body  hot

Figure 2.23 Flat Press

<!-- image -->

- blower. In some hotels instead of Suzy body press - collar, cuff, sleeves are used.
-  Calendaring machine -This is a very large machine consisting of several and heated well-padded roller which iron the article as it passes through, only that
- article are calendar and  a  large calendar will be wide enough to take a double bed sheet all, that pieces of linen  bed  sheet,  pillow  slip,  table cloths and serviettes can be ironed in this  machine.  After  ironing  articles are  folded  by  hand  or  by  a  folding machine.
-  Folding Machines -Folding machines do not fold the linen as such but  aid  the  worker  in  doing  so.  The machines  hold  down  one  end  of  the

Figure 2.24 Folding Machine

<!-- image -->

linen to be folded so that the workers can fold it more easily.

Dry-cleaning equipment: These are similar to washing machines of the tumbler type. They  are  available  in  a  wide  range  of  capacities.  They  are  steam-powered  or electrically  operated.  They  carry  washing,  extracting,  drying  and  deodorising  in  a continuous  process.  Solvent  filtration  and  distillation  are  carried  out  in  a  closed system.

Carts, Trolleys and Sacks: These are used for the transfer of clean linen from the laundry to the linen room to the floor pantries and so on. Linen carts and trolleys may be made of aluminium or steel.

-  What  are  the  points  to  be  considered  while  purchasing  laundry equipment?

-  To  get  first  and  information  from  people  who  have  used  the machines.
-  The  quality  of  the  process  while  dealing  with  uniform  and guest laundry.
-  How compact or bulky the equipment is, as the extend of space required will depend on this.
-  The efficiency and the actual production of the machine when compared to the rated capacity.
-  The consumption of various utilities such as steam, electricity and  hot  and  cold  water.  There  are  machines  available  which save more energy than others.
-  The  servicing  and  maintenance  requirement  and  breakdown frequency as to how expensive are the spare parts.
-  The  training  needs  to  be  imparted  to  staff  to  make  best utilization of the features offered by the equipment.

Valet Service: By Valet Service the hotel takes care of the guest laundry needs. A laundry valet is a staff who works for the laundry and so he takes around on the guest floor, two or three times in the morning and collect all the clothes from various rooms in  separate  laundry  bags  with  appropriate  information  as  to  how  many  pieces  of clothes to be washed/pressed or dry cleaned. He is also responsible to return the clean clothes back to the guestrooms. Hotels that provide valet service are often quicker and promote  more  goodwill.  Most  important,  however  revenue,  the  valet  service generates. An efficient valet service generates and helps in defray the overall laundry cost,  offering  valet  service  required,  the  housekeeping  department  to  setup  its  own laundry business. To support the business it must:

-  Set time for laundry pickup and delivery.
-  Determine how laundry will deliver the guestrooms.
-  Figure bills to be attached to clean laundry.
-  Determine  the  hotel  liability  policy  in  accordance  with  state and local laws.
-  Handles lost and damage article.
-  Field guest comments and complaints.

Laundry Agents or Aids: Laundry ‗aids' are the material used to improve laundering results  (bleaches,  optical  whiteners)  or  to  accomplish  specific  functions  or  effects (soaks, stain removers, softeners, stiffeners)

The  important  laundry  agents  or  aids  are  water,  laundry  soaps  and  detergents, stiffening  agents,  bleaches,  alkaline  agents,  acid  agents,  organic  solvents  and absorbents.

## LAUNDRY SOAPS AND DETERGENTS

SOAP: ‗Soap' is technically also a type of detergent and is the most widelyused fabric cleaner ‗soaps' are the sodium, salts of fatty acids and are widely made by reacting natural oils with sodium hydroxide or another caustic alkali. All soaps contain water but not more than 30 per centis good soaps.

While selecting laundry soaps, the following criteria must be kept in mind:

-  The soap should be of a clear, pale colour as dark-coloured soaps may contain impurities that aren't easily visible.

-  The  soap  should  feel  firm  when  passed.  If  it  feels  soft,  it  may  contain excessive amount of water and will be wasteful in use.
-  A  good  laundry  soap  dries  to  form  a  firm,  unspeckled  surface.  Soaps  that develop  white  crystals  on  the  surface  should  not  be  used,  as  this  shows  an excess of harmful alkalis.

DETERGENTS: Soap-free  detergents  have  properties  similar  to  soap-  such  as foaming,  wetting  and  cleaning  -  but  they  are  able  to  make  soluble  salts  out  of  the calcium, magnesium and other metal salts that make water ‗hard' and render ordinary soap insoluble. Detergents and soaps act by lowering the surface tension of water.

## FABRIC STIFFENERS AND SOFTENERS

Fabric softeners are added with sours in the final wash cycle. Softeners make fabrics suppler and easier to finish.

Stiffening :  A  certain  amount  of  crispness  in  fabrics  given  a  fresh  look.  This  crisp appearance is obtained by using stiffeners. Commonly the term ‗starching' is used for the process, even though the stiffening agent may be something more than starch. Softening - Fabric tend to start feeling harsh after repeated laundering. This is due to the build-up of salts (present in hard water) on the fibres during the last rinse of the washing process. Softness can be imparted to these fabrics using chemical softeners in alaundry  process.  Softeners  coat  the  fibres  of  the  fabric  and  make  them  softer  and fluffier.

Bleaches: The  chemical  are  capable  of  whitening  fabrics  and  removing  stains  by destroying  pigmented  matter.  They  also  disinfect  and  deodorize.  Their  action  of combating  yellowing  and  discolouring  is  due  to  chemical  reaction  -  it  is  generally oxidation but vary sometimes be reduction. Various types of bleaches are:

Oxidising bleaches - These bleaches release oxygen, which combines with the stains to form a colourless compound. The bleach should be left in contact with the fabric only until the stain is removed or else the fabric will be weakened.

Open air sunlight -  This  is  the  world's  oldest  and  cheapest  method  of  bleaching. Hanging  clothes  out  in  the  sun  to  dry  keeps  white  clothes  sparkling.  Sunlight bleaching can also be used for stain removal for bleaches cotton and linen fabrics.

Sodium Hypochlorite (Javelin water)

Sodium chlorite

Hydrogen peroxide

Sodium per borate

Potassium permanganate

Bleaching powder

## ALKALINE AGENTS/ ALKALINE BUILDERS

Washing  soda  (Sodium  Carbonate,  Na2Co310H2o)  This  is  the  most  commonly used additive in detergents. It is used along with soap to improve the cleaning power of  soap,  particularly  on  the  boil.  Washing  soda  also  softens  water  and  emulsifies grease stains. It is used for removing vegetable stains and scorch marks in particulars.

Borax  (Sodium  Tetraborate,  Na2B4O7.10H2O) -  This  compound  occurs  naturally and is sold as a white powder. It is mildly alkaline substance, readily soluble in cold water and can be used safely on any fibre. The alkalinity is useful in removing acid stains. The addition of borax to starch solution (in 1:16 ratio) prevents its scorching or browning at the high temperature used for finishing collars.

Ammonium Hydroxide (NH4OH) - This is sometimes purchased as a concentrated solution.  It  must  be  used  with  care  as  its  pungent  vapours  may  cause  coughing and choking.  Ammonia  is  a  strong  alkali,  capable  of  yellowing  silk  and  wool,  making colours bleed and in the time tenderising the fabric.

## ACID AGENTS

Oxalic Acid - This is a poison and should be kept in a jar labelled as such. It is sold in the  form  of  white  crystals.  Its  uses  include  the  removal  of  obstinate  fruit  stains, bleaching of brown stains left after the potassium permanganate and removal of the tannin base of the ink stains together with hydrogen peroxide.

Salt of Lemon - This is a compound of potassium oxalate and oxalic acid, referred to as potassium bi-noxalate. It is also called ‗salt of sorrel'. It is used in the same way and in the same proportion as oxalic acid.

Acetic Acid -  This  is  one  of  the  most  important acids in use in the laundry. Acetic acid is sold in several strengths, glacial acetic acid being the strongest and purest. It should  not  be  stored  in  metal  vessels  but  only  in  glass  enamelware  or  earthenware vessels.  A  weak  solution  of  vinegar  is  used  as  a  steeping  bath  to  remove  excessive bluing agents and as a neutralising agent.

## ORGANIC SOLVENT

Cleaning Benzene (C6H6) or Petrol - This is obtained from the distillation of shale oil or petroleum. It is highly inflammable and should be kept or used indoors in large quantities; ofcourse, it must never be used, even in small quantities, near an open fire either. It is valuable for removing stains containing grease.

Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) -  This  is  more  expensive  than  cleaning  benzene  but similar in action and has the advantage of being non-flammable.

Methylated  Spirit -  This  is  ethyl  alcohol  (C2H5OH)  mixed  with  methyl  alcohol (CH3OH), which makes it poisonous. It is solid coloured with a violet dye to draw attention  to  this  fact.  Although  not  a  very  good  solvent,  it  can  be  used  to  remove sealing wax, silver nitrate and silver stains.

Paraffin - This is a mixture of hydrocarbons. It is a white, waxy solid obtained as a residue from the distillation of petroleum and shale.

Turpentine  (C10H16) -  This  solvent  is  more  expensive  than  paraffin.  It  has  s distinctive smell and is both inflammable and violate. It acts as a solvent for grease, vanish, paint and printer's ink.

## 2.12  Summary

This chapter describes the importance and functions of the housekeeping control desk. The housekeeping control desk is the nerve centre of all communication from and to the housekeeping department. The document and files maintained at control desk are discussed in detailed . Rooms and public areas must be cleaned and serviced each day. All  rooms  and  public  areas  should  present  a  fresh  pleasing  appearance  and  provide comfortable  conditions  for  those  using  them.  Daily  maintenance  removes  dirt, accumulation of which is dangerous for health as it forms breeding ground for germs.

Day  to  day  care  encourage  high  standard  of  work.  It  allows  the  time  allocated  for special cleaning to be spent out to full advantage.

A system of key control is essential to the security of a lodging property.  All keys whether  metal  or  electronic  should  be  adequately  controlled.  Most  lodging establishments use emergency keys, master keys and guestroom keys. In this lesson, we also looked into various aspects of the linen room planning, layout, location and activities.  We  further  learnt  about  the  inventory  maintenance  and  its  functioning. Detailed information relating to selection criteria for linen,   Also  in  this  lesson,  we dealt in detail with the supply of various linen items to the guest rooms, their retrieval after use, their laundering and recycling.

It is essential to ensure a continuous supply of linen, which is well laundered, so that hotel  operations  can  be  carried  out  smoothly  and  efficiently.  The  principles  of laundering are: removal of dirt and stains from the linen articles and restoring linen articles to their original appearance as far as possible. A commercial or off-premises laundry  refers  to  laundering  activities  performed  outside  the  establishment.  An  onpremises laundry  refers  to laundering  activities  carried  on  within  the  hotel  by  staff employed.

## 3.1 Introduction

A interior design describes a group of various yet related projects that involve turning an interior space into an effective setting for the range of human activities that are to take  place  there  It  is  the  arrangement  of  line,  direction,  form,  shape,  colour,  and texture and arranging them aesthetically and tastefully. Interior decoration is the art of creating a pleasant atmosphere in the living room with the addition of a complex of furnishings,  art,  and  crafts,  appropriately  combined  to  achieve  a  planned  result  or design.  These  arts  and  crafts  have  to  be  well  maintained  by  the  housekeeping department. Decorating flowers is a creative and stimulating art which often carries a message or theme. Flowers and indoor plants add colour and beauty to a room.

It is of two types:-

-  Structural design
-  Decorative design

Structural  Design is  suitable  to  the  purpose  for  which  the  objects  are  made.  All objects have structural design. It must fulfil the following requirements:

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

-  Design must be suited to its purpose
-  It must have correct proportions
-  It must be simple
-  The material used must be suitable to its purpose.

Decorative  design makes  the  structural  design  more  beautiful  .A  design  added  to increase the beauty of an article is called decorative design. It requires:

-  Decoration must be used in moderation
-  It should be placed at structural points to strengthen the shape of the object
-  It should enrich and not interfere with the structural design.

A design should not only be beautiful but also have individuality, character, style and utility e.g.-chair.

## 3.2 Objectives

After reading this unit the learner will able to:

-  Describe a significant role played by colour in interior decoration.
-  Explain the importance of lighting.
-  Plan window treatment for various kind of window.
-  Enumerate the various kinds of beds, mattresses and bedding.

## 3.3 Elements of Design

Design elements are the basic units of a visual image. These elements include:

The 3 f's: Form, Follows and Function are known as the 3 f's of Design. Form refers to what something looks like, and function refers to how it works.

Space: Space  is  the  area  provided  for  a  particular  purpose.  It  may  have  two dimensions  (length  and  width,  such  as  a  floor,  or  it  may  have  three  dimensions (length,  width,  and  height).  Space  includes  the  background,  foreground  and  middle ground. Space refers to the distances or areas around, between or within components of a piece. There are two types of space: positive and negative space. Positive space refers to the space of a shape representing the subject matter. Negative space refers to the space around and between the subject matter.

Line: Line  is  the  basic  element  that  refers  to  the  continuous  movement  of  a  point along  a  surface,  such  as  by  a  pencil  or  brush.  The  edges  of  shapes  and  forms  also create lines. It is the basic component of a shape drawn on paper. Lines and curves are the basic building blocks of two dimensional shapes like a house's plan. Every line has length,  thickness,  and  direction.  There  are  curved,  horizontal,  vertical,  diagonal, zigzag, wavy, parallel, dash, and dotted lines.

Colour: Colour is seen either by the way light reflects off a surface or in colours light sources. Colour and particularly contrasting colour is also used to draw the attention to a  particular  part  of  the  image.  There  are  primary  colours,  secondary  colours,  and tertiary colours. Complementary colours are colours that are opposite to each other on the  colour  wheel.  Complementary  colours  are  used  to  create  contrast.  Analogous colours are colours that are found side by side on the colour wheel. These can be used to create colour harmony. Monochromatic colours are tints and shades of one colour. Warm colours are a group of colours that consist of reds, yellows, and oranges. Cool colours are group of colours that consist of purples, greens, and blues.

Shape: A shape is defined as an area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, colour, or texture. They can be geometric or organic. Shapes in hotel decor and interior design can  be  used  to  add  interest,  style,  theme  to  a  design  like  a  door.  Shape  in  interior design  depends  on  the  function  of  the  object  like  a  kitchen  cabinet  door.  Natural shapes forming patterns on wood or stone may help increase visual appeal in interior design. In a landscape, natural shapes, such as trees contrast with geometric such as houses.

Texture: Texture is perceived surface quality. In art, there are two types of texture: tactile  and  implied.  Tactile  texture  (real  texture)  is  the  way  the  surface  of  an  object actually feels. Examples of this include sandpaper, cotton balls, tree bark, puppy fur, etc. Implied texture is the way the surface of an object looks like it feels. The texture may look rough, fizzy, gritty, but cannot actually be felt. This type of texture is used by artists when drawing or painting.

Form: Form  is  any  three  dimensional  object.  Form  can  be  measured,  from  top  to bottom  (height),  side  to  side  (width),  and  from  back  to  front  (depth).  Form  is  also defined by light and dark. There are two types  of form, geometric (man-made) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture and colour. It can be illustrated or constructed.

Value: Value is an element of art that refers to the relationship between light and dark on a surface or object and also helps with Form. It gives objects depth and perception. Value is also referred to as tone.

## 3.3.1 Principles of Design

The elements of art are line, form, colour and texture.  This must be handled within conformity with certain principles and laws that govern their use if beauty is to result. Every art field has certain guidelines that are to be followed and the same is applicable in planning of interiors.

Scale  and  proportion: By  habit,  the  human  eye  becomes  accustomed  to  definite dimensions  in  daily  life.   Some  of  these  dimensions  are  fixed  for  convenience. Proportion is the law of relationship, which demands that all space divisions should be pleasingly related to each other and to the whole. The Greeks developed a great deal of calculations about space distribution and a scale of space relationships. These skills are used even today.  The normal ratios are 2:3, 3:5 and 5:8.  These forms are equal divisions.   A  square  room  is  more  difficult  to  arrange  and  uninteresting  to  live  in. Rooms  should  be  preferably  furnished  with  smaller  furniture  types  and  consistent patterns.  The furniture should be in proportion to the size and height of the room and its architectural features.

Balance: It  is  the  principle  of  design,  which  produces  a  feeling  of  restfulness  and contentment.  Balance deals with quantity or number in the arrangement, colour and distribution  of  pattern  or  plain  surfaces.   Balance  is  the  result  of  equalisation  of attraction  on  either  side  of  a  central  point.   Balance  can  be  attributed  to  colours, texture, pattern and light. There are two types of balance:

-  Formal Balance

-  Informal Balance

Formal Balance: Formal or symmetrical balance occurs when objects of equal size and weight are placed on each side and at equal distance from the centre.  When they are identical, the balance is symmetrical.

Informal  Balance: Informal  or  asymmetrical  balance  results  when  objects  are arranged in such a way that a large one nears the centre, smaller ones away from the centre.   Both  types  of  balances  are  attractive.   Formal  represents  intellect  while informal represents feelings.  This also has emotional significances.

Rhythm: This  is  the  principle  of  design  that  suggests  connected  movement  in  a pleasant manner.  It can be obtained through a repetition of light, forms, and colours or  through  a  progression  of  rise  or  continuous  line  movement.   Rhythm  is  achieved through repetition, progression, transition, opposition and radiation.

Emphasis: It  is  the  principle  of  design  that  centres  interest  on  the  most  important thing in the arrangement in a room. Emphasis may be centred on a painting, fireplace, window treatment or furniture grouping.  All other parts must be subordinated to the interesting point.  It is better to understand emphasised rather than over emphasized. Emphasis can be created at any point in the room.  Dramatic use of art components creates emphasis i.e. Large and unusual forms, different surface patterns, more light elsewhere and unusual texture and contrasting colours.

## 3.4 Colour

Colour  establishes  an  aesthetic  connection  between  objects  and  set  of  mood.  The study  of  colour  may  be  approached  from  any  of  the  five  angles  i.e  physiologist, chemists,  physicist  and  psychologists  or  people  who  works  with  pigments.  Of  the many theories of colour two are in common use. These are generally known as the Prang system and Munsell system.

Dimension of Colours: When the average person thinks of color, he or she usually considers  the  aesthetic  aspects  of  color  such  as  the  shade  and  whether  it's  light  or dark; or a cool or warm tone. There are three properties or qualities that develop the 3dimensional  color  space  concept-  distint  as  the  length,  breath  and  thickness  of  an object.

Hue: Hue represents the color itself-red, yellow, blue, etc.   If you were to take the visible spectrum-red, orange, yellow, blue, indigo and violet-and place  each  color  in  a  circle.  The  colour  of  an  object  is  determined  by  the wavelengths  of  the  light  reflect.  An  object  appears  black  when  all  the wavelengths are absorbed and white when all reflected.

Value: It  is  the  one  dimension  of  color  space  that  can  stand  alone.  Value represents the lightness or darkness of a given hue the value ranges from 0 for pure black to 10 for pure white.  In the absence of hue you would simply have black, white or shades of gray.

Tint is the term used to describe a hue that has been lighted in value from its normal value. Pink is tint of red. Tints are achieved by mixing white with a pigment or by using a pigment in a dilute form to allow for the white of the ground to show through.

Shade is the term used to describe a hue that has been darkened in value from its normal value.  That your coat is not true blue but some blend of blue with other colors. Maroon is a shade of red. Shades are achieved by mixing black with a pigment. NoteThis use of the term shade is specific to color theory. In common usage a -shade‖ is usually a variation in color of a hue. To say -your coat is a nice shade of blue‖ usually means

Intensity/Chrome: It  refers  to  the  purity  of  a  hue  and  the  brightness  or dullness  of  a  color  Intensity  is  also  known  as Chroma or Saturation .  The highest intensity or purity of a hue is the hue as it appears in the spectrum or on the color wheel. A hue reduced in intensity is called a Tone . A tone is a hue with reduced or dulled strength.

## WARM AND COOL COLORS

Warm colors in the most general terms, are related to the yellow/red side of the color wheel chart.  They  attract  attention  and  are  generally  perceived  as  energetic  or exciting. Cool colors, on the other hand, sit on the blue/green side of the color wheel; they are generally perceived as soothing and calm.

Figure  3.1 Prangs' colour wheel

<!-- image -->

The  12-part  colour  wheel  is  based  on  the  three primary  colours (red,  yellow  and blue) placed evenly around a circle. Between the three primaries are the secondary colours (green, orange and violet), which are mixtures of the two primaries they sit between.  The tertiary  colours fall  between  each  primary  and  secondary.  Between yellow  and  orange,  for  example, is  yellow  orange;  between  blue  and  violet  is  blue violet  and  so  on.  All  the  colours  around  the  outside  of  the  colour  wheel  are  called saturated colours . They contain no black, no white and none of their complimentary or opposite colour.

Munsell sytem: When the average person thinks of color, he or she usually considers the aesthetic aspects of color such as the shade and whether it's light or dark; or a cool or warm tone.  However, A.H. Munsell saw color in terms of its relationship to other colors, which led him to develop his 3-dimensional color space concept.  He described color space using objects with which most people would be familiar, such as a -color tree‖ to teach and communicate color with greater understanding and clarity .

## 3.4.1 Colour Scheme

Colour is a very potent feature in interior design because it evokes almost immediate response  from  the  eye  and  can  produce  both  physical  and  psychological  reaction. Designers can work wonders with colour and colour combinations if they have a good knowledge of colour and its effects.

A good decorator always combines both value and practicality to evolve a scheme, which will work to the best advantage of the interiors.  Standard colour harmonies are divided into two main groups:

- 1. Similar or Related Harmonies
- 2. Contrasting or Complimentary Harmony

Similar or related harmonies: Selecting colours that are close to each other on the colour wheel produces related harmony. This includes two types of schemes

-  monochromatic
-  analogous schemes.

Monochromatic  harmony indicates  the  selection  of  one  colour  or  hue.   Different values must contrast in a single colour harmony.  This scheme is quite safe, effective, and  peaceful  in  small  areas.  However,  tends  to  get  tiresome  and  monotonous,  if carried  out  in  an  entire  room.   Additional  interest  may  be  created  by  providing contrasts and combining textures through various surfaces.

Analogous scheme is produced by a combination of adjacent hues that have one hue in common.  The analogous are a combination of primary or secondary colours with two intermediate colours on either side of it.  This scheme is quite restful and shows greater varieties.

Contrasting  or  complimentary  harmony: Combining colours  that  are  opposite  to each other and far away on the colour wheel produces complimentary harmony. They should differ in value and intensity.

This group includes different types:

-  Complimentary harmony
-  Double complimentary harmony
-  Split complimentary harmony
-  Triad harmony
-  Accented Neutral Harmony

Complimentary  Harmony: This  is  obtained  by  using  colours  lying  opposite  each other on the colour wheel e.g. Blue and orange with yellow and violet etc.  This type of  harmony  provides  a  richer  effect  of  colour  than  related  harmony.   It  can  be successfully  used  for  rooms,  window  displays  and  outdoors.   It  should  have  strong colour intensity.

Double Complimentary Harmony: In this scheme, two directly adjacent colours and their complimentary colours are used together for a double complimentary harmony e.g.  Yellow  and  yellow  green  with  red  and  red  violet.   In  using  this  scheme,  the outstanding view should contain the largest amount of colours, that is, the dullest of all the colours.  The next may be a little bright but should be partially neutralised.  The fourth colour, which is used in the least quantity, should have the brightest intensity.

Split  Complimentary  Harmony: It  is  the  combination  of  primary  or  intermediate colours on either side of the colour wheel; compliment yellow with red violet and blue violet, blue with red orange and yellow orange, red with blue green and yellow green etc.  A true split complimentary scheme is a harmony of similar colours with a note of contrasting colours. The amount of different values and intensities should be adjusted to prevent a shocking effect.

Triad Harmony: This is a combination of any three colours that form on equilateral triangle on the colour wheel.  It requires careful treatment and can provide the richest and  most  interesting  harmony.   But  if  not  carefully  planned,  it  can  have  a  very irritating effect e.g. Red yellow blue orange, violet & green and red violet blue green and yellow orange.

Accented Neutral Harmony: It  is  a  harmony  in  which  the  largest  area  of  the  room will be neutralised with a smaller area in a brighter colour.

## EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF COLOUR

How Colour Affects Mood: Relying strictly on the colour wheel to make decorating decisions leaves an important factor out of the equation: the moods that colours can create.  The  colours  you  live  with  really  do  influence  your  emotions.  Some  palates lighten and brighten your mood while others pacify or purify. We respond to colour with our hearts, not just our heads, so it's important to choose wisely. Understand that colours behave in three basic ways -- active, passive, and neutral -- and you can easily match  every  room's  colours  to  your  personal  desires  and  taste  and  to  the  room's purpose.

Active Colours: On the warm side of the colour wheel, active colours include yellow, orange, and red. These advancing, extroverted hues stand out to greet and sometimes dominate.  They  inspire  conversation  and  an  upbeat  attitude.  Red,  the  most  intense, pumps the adrenaline like no other hue. Small doses of the fire-engine hue wake up an entry or turn up the heat on a hearthside den. Golden or lemony yellows -- good for home offices and kitchens -- unleash creative juices.

Passive  Colours: The  cool  colours  -  blue,  green,  and  purple  -  will  pacify,  staying quietly  in  the  background  to  calm  and  restore  depleted  spirits.  They're  ideal  for bedrooms or private retreats, but if yours is a cold climate, you may want to work in some sunny accents for warmth and contrast.

Neutral Colours: Neutralizers are the "uncolors": browns, beiges, greys, whites, and taupe. They neither activate nor pacify but combine and cooperate, bridging together different  rooms and colours. They're good transitions on woodwork, trim, hallways, and  functional  spaces  like  kitchens  and  baths,  but  even  living  rooms  can  benefit. Darker neutrals tone down other colours; crisp white intensifies them.

Colour  Language: Curious  about  how  colour  influences  mood?  Here  are  a  few examples:

Pink: soothes, acquiesces; promotes affability and affection.

Yellow: expands, cheers; increases  energy. It  is  warm  but  not  over  bearing. Cream and light tans are suitable background colours.

White:

Black:

purifies, energizes, unifies; in combination, enlivens all other colours. disciplines, authorizes, strengthens; encourages independence.

Orange: cheers,  commands;  stimulates  appetites,  conversation,  and  charity. Beige and tan are favoured as background colours.

Red: empowers,  stimulates,  dramatizes,  competes;  symbolizes  passion.  It  is the strongest of colours and is associated with danger.  When reduced to a tint of pink it losses its intensity and becomes milder and delicate.  As a shade, red may give a warm brown.

Green: balances,  normalizes,  refreshes;  encourages  emotional  growth. It  is associated with nature, health and well-being.   It provides dignity and solidity. Purple : comforts, spiritualises; creates mystery and draws out intuition.

Blue: relaxes, refreshes, cools; produces tranquil feelings and peaceful moods. It  is  associated  with  simplicity,  purity,  truth  and  meditation.   It  stimulates intellectual activity but in the extreme, it could lead to depression.

Violet :  It  is  the  colour  of  tension  and  ambiguity.  It  represents  sensitivity, subtlety and has lavender in playful and magical.  Deep violet should be used with caution.

A combination  of  colours  from  the  three  families  i.e.  Warm,  cool  and  neutral  in  a correct  balance  will  provide  attractive  and  comfortable  interiors.   Colours  may  also have an advancing or receding effect.   Warm colours tend to appear closer than their actual distance while cool colours tend to have a receding effect. Spaces can be made to seem larger or smaller through choice of colours and shape.  A long narrow space can be made to seem less long and less narrow through the use of warm colours on either ends and cool colours on the sides. A low ceiling will seem less oppressive in light colours where as a high ceiling will appear lower in dark tones.

## 3.4.2 Functional Consideration in Colour Scheme

The  function  of  the  place  should  be  manifested  through  the  colour  harmony.   The maintenance availability and cost must be considered.  Light colours are soiled easily and may prove to be more expensive in terms of time and money.  In private areas, it is  important to create a personalised colour atmosphere.  In a room shared by many groups, preference should prevail, e.g. Restaurants, lobby and other public places. Sub divide a room into the following areas of colour distribution - dominant area (walls, floor  and  ceilings)  medium  area  (draperies,  upholstery,  furniture  and  bed  spreads), small  furniture  (cushions,  pillows  and  table  cloths),  accent  areas  (accessories, paintings, lamp shades etc.)

According to the law of chromatic distribution, the largest area should be covered with a  neutralised  colour.   As  the  area  reduces  in  size,  chromatic  intensity  may  be proportionally increased. Any two hues may be used if they are at the proper degree of neutralisation.   They  should  preferably  contrast  in  their  values,  e.g.  Like  walls  and dark floor where the draperies and upholstery are of an intermediate value. Contrast

creates interest; neutral colours are formal while brighter values are more informal.  A neutralised colour appears more neutral in small areas than in larger areas.

Colours  selection  is  influenced  by  climate,  orientation  activity  and  preference.  In hotels, entrances, lobbies and front desk areas invite the use of strong colours to make a  positive  first  impression.   Lobbies  and  lounges  can  have  warm  colours  to  support comfort  but  cooler  tones  in  warm  climate.   All  the  schemes  should  be  generally agreeable  to  the  guest.   Corridors  leading  to  guest  room  should  be  given  a  lively colour treatment.  In bedrooms, intense colour must be avoided on ceilings and large wall  areas.   Restaurants  may  fail  by  using  insensitivity  to  colour  since  appetite  is influenced by light and colour.  Black, grey, blue and violet should be avoided.

## 3.5 Lighting

Light  is  an  essential  element  of  every  interior  scheme  and  should  be  given  special attention in the initial plan of each room.  Sufficient and conveniently planned outlets should  be  an  integral  part  of  architectural  planning.   Planning  of  artificial  light presents a major problem, as it requires both aesthetic and practical considerations. The average room lighting equipments and fixtures must be consistent with the style of the décor and must consistently contribute to the character and atmosphere of the room.

## 3.5.1 Types of Lighting

Natural: Day light provides natural light and varies according to the position of the sun  and  time  of  the  day.   Light  is  necessary  for  colour  visibility.  Textures  are  also influenced by light absorbed or reflected by them.

Artificial: These are of two types:

-  Incandescent
-  Fluorescent

Incandescent Lighting : In this type of lighting tungsten filament is sealed in a glass bulb  and  heated  to  a  point  at  which  it  glows.   The  glass  bulbs  are  usually  made  of standard  lined  glass/heat  resistant  borosilicate  glass,  which  permits  higher  voltage used for outdoor lighting.  Same bulbs are finished with an acid solution from inside which etches the glass and gives a frosted effect.

Fluorescent  Lighting: This  consists  of  sealed  glass  tubes,  which  contains  mercury and halogen glass. It has electrodes at each end and on the inside, the tube is coated with  a  florescent  material  containing  phosphorous.  When  a  current  is  passed,  the mercury  vapour  emits  ultra  violet  light  which  is  converted  into  visible  light  by  the phosphorous on the inside surface of the tube. The lifespan of the incandescent lamp would be 750-2000 hrs and of a fluorescent light 1800-20000 hrs. Fluorescent lamps are suited for lower ceiling application and general lighting.  They provide diffused light.

## CONSIDERATION IN LIGHTING SELECTION

Function: The function of lighting must be evaluated in terms of quantity and quality of vision. The primary goal is visual clarity and to safeguard guest.

Safety: Safety is important in light consideration since improper lighting could prove  hazardous  to  persons  working  in  a  particular  area.   Staircases  require adequate lightings to prevent accidents. Proper wiring insulations and earthing should also be considered for safety.

Beauty: A  close  relationship  exists  between  the  type  of  lighting  and appearance of colour.  Wrong colour choices reduce the effectiveness of wellplanned schemes.  The designer should use brightness/ contrast to create visual interest. Interior lighting should be an integral part of the total designing of the area.

## METHODS OF LIGHTING

Architectural lighting :  It  supplies functional lighting and is good for contemporary rooms.

-  Valence  Lighting: A  historical  fluorescent  tube  is  placed  behind  a  valence board, carting up light which reflects and then down, shining on the drapery by providing both direct and indirect light.
-  Cornice  Lighting: A  cornice  is  insulated  in  ceiling  and  directs  the  light downward.   It  can  provide  a  dramatic  effect  on  drapery,  wall  covering  and pictures.
-  Covered Lighting: Covered lighting consists of placing a series of continuous fluorescent tubes in a group or placed at one or more walls of a room.
-  Soffit Lighting: This is a method of direct lighting in which the illumination from  the  light  source  is  built  into  the  underside  of  soffits  or  beams  used  in staircases, reception, lounges etc.
-  Luminous Lighting: This is recessed lighting to light up a particular area e.g. Kitchens, utility areas, bathrooms etc.

Non  Architectural  Lighting: This  consists  of  the  light  reflected  from  walls  and ceilings. Portable lamps may also be used for general overall light or localised light.

Other Lighting: Table lightings, point source, accent diffused and ambient lighting.

Lighting Systems: Types of lightings my be classified by the manner in which the light rays are directed on the object to be illuminated.

Direct  Lighting: It  is  a  type  of  light  that  is  produced  by  most  table  and  floor lamps.   The  light  is  directed  downwards  and  the  ceiling  receives  reflected  light. This  light  produces  sharp  shadows  and  some  times  a  glare.   Direct  lighting  is usually combined with other types of lighting according to the requirements e.g. Spot lightings.

Indirect Lighting: In  this  type  of  lighting,  the  light  is  directed  to  the  ceiling  or walls  from  which  it  is  reflected  into  the  rooms.   The  immediate  light  source  is secluded from view. Overall, room illumination with indirect lighting will diffuse or shadow less with low, less, light source brightness.  When used above, indirect lighting is flat and uninteresting without shadows. It is suitable for general lighting of the covered valence and cornice fitting.  Other lighting systems are semi direct and semi indirect lighting.

## 3.5.4 Light Fittings

-  Dimmers: These are combined with on and off switches and control the level of lights on & off at one certain time or at different times in different rooms. Several dimmers can be attached to a single control.
-  Anti Burglar: These lights function on a time switch which turn the lights on and off at a certain time or at different times in different rooms.
-  Door Switch :  This light is set in the doorframe and gets turned on when the door is opened.
-  Photo Cell Control: Light sensitive units can replace switches at the entrance where a photocell card needs to be installed to activate the lights.
-  Full Fittings or Pendant Lights: These are fitted over dining tables, billiards table  and  for  spot  lighting.   The  control  switch  may  be  a  finger  tap  switch provided at the table.

## LIGHTING FOR DIFFERENT AREAS IN HOTELS

Entrance Halls: Entrance halls should look interesting and the lighting should be in keeping with the atmosphere of the place. During the day, an entrance can appear dull and dim if one comes from outside. The light in the hall should be bright enough at the reception  desk,  on  display  boards  etc.   Care  should  be  taken  to  avoid  glare  but  the light should be sufficient for the guest to be able to read clearly.

Lounge Area: In the lounge area, a chandelier or a general light fitting may be fixed to provide overall light. Cornice lighting may be fixed to reflect on the ceiling, coved lighting may be provided by using wall brackets and other fittings.  When there is a false ceiling, the light may come in through the gaps in the ceiling or through glass panels  fitted  in  the  ceiling.   Lamp  fittings  here  are  concealed  and  only  the  light  is reflected. The atmosphere of the lounge should be comfortable and restful.  Localised lights may be used if necessary and portable fittings may be provided.  In case of an area attached to a cafeteria, higher degree of illumination may be necessary for quick service.

Restaurants: In  restaurants,  subdued  lighting  is  generally  perfected  specially  at heights.  General  lighting  is  normally  used  for  banquets.  Fluorescent  lightings  may also be used.  The effect of lighting on the colour of food should be considered.

Corridors: Subdued  lighting  may  be  required  in  corridors  but  gloom  should  be avoided and the guest should be able to see the room number clearly.  Placement of light  should  not  be  very  far  from  each  other.   Cornice  or  ceiling  lights  are  quite appropriate.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Stairs: Stairs should be well lit to prevent accidents.  The lights can be set along the wall or just below the handrail.  In case of overhead light, fittings should be placed at the end of each flight of stairs.

Bedroom: Bedrooms do not generally require general lighting but adequate lighting should be provided in different parts of the room.  The light should not be too bright. A general wall light, a table lamp, bedside lights are the standard light.  Lights should be controlled at the door as well as the headboard of the bed to prevent accidents or to have the guest enter into a darkened room.  Bedside lights may be mounted on to the wall or fixed as table lamps.  They should be placed sufficiently high to enable the guest to read a book.  Dressing table light should provide sufficient light to illuminate the face and not the mirror. Pelmet lights can be fixed which illuminates the curtain and  giving  a  soft  glow  around  the  window  area.   The  wardrobe  built  in  cupboards should have one light inside to enable guests to see the contents clearly.  This light may be fixed to the ceiling of the wardrobe.

Bathroom: In  a  bathroom, safety is of prime importance.  The fittings must be safe with vapour and water proof fittings. All electrical fittings and equipment should have dual switches which can be controlled from outside.  Plastic or glass is preferred to metal.  An emergency light that operates independently of the main supply should be provided  which  comes  on  during  power  failure.   This  light  should  be  placed  in staircases corridors and exit entrances.

## Impact of Lighting on Mood and Atmosphere

The selection of lighting systems, light intensity, its colour and the accessories used influence the mood and atmosphere of the room.  Lighting in the bedroom should be warm  and  relaxing.  Yet,  it  should  be  bright  enough  to  observe  the  articles  in  the room.  Light of low wattage and medium wattage is suitable.  Using dimmer switches can  change  the  atmosphere  and  mood.   A  series  of  down  lighters  and  wall  washers will be suitable to light up the room and prevent glare to the occupants.  Subsidiary lighting  by  the  telephone,  mirror,  coats  rack  may  be  necessary.   In  a  restaurant,  a relaxing  mood  can  be  created  by  using  pelmet  lights  and  pendent  lamps  above  the table.  The light should be dim around the people, but with medium wattage over the food.

Passageways should be visible .  Candlelight  may  also  be  used  to  create  a  romantic ambience. Bright pools of light alternating with shadows provide a warm welcome. Lights in office area must provide general light as well as spot lighting on the table. Reading lights should be situated behind the user at the top left hand side.

## 3.6 Window treatment

A window treatment is  an interior decorating element placed on, in, around or over a window. Often, a goal of professional window treatment is to install the elements which enhance the aesthetics of the window and the room.

## 3.6.1    Types of Window Treatment

Figure3.2 Types of window treatment

<!-- image -->

Soft  Window  Treatments: Soft  window  treatments  comprise  curtains,  valances, swags,  etc.  Curtains  often  contribute  more  to  the  atmosphere  of  the  room  than  any other item of furnishing. Plain, heavy curtains falling down to the floor can be used o create  a  formal  setting.  Short  curtains  made  of  light,  brightly  patterned  fabrics  are used  to  create  an  informal,  relaxed  atmosphere.  Apart  from  creating  the  desired atmosphere, curtains give flexible control over privacy, heat, light and to some extent noise.  The  various  fabric  used  for  making  curtains  are  cotton,  linen,  rayon,  glass fibres, acrylic and silk for luxurious setting. Care should be taken to minimize their exposure to sunlight and airborne soils, as these reduce the curtains' functional life. Good curtains are usually lined and heavy curtains re interlined. The lining helps the curtain to drape well and protect them for sunlight and airborne dust.

Curtains fulfill several important functions    :

-  They give flexible control over privacy, heat, light.
-  They soak up noise in proportion to the area they cover, the thickness of the fabric and the depths of the folds.
-  They can add colour an pattern to the décor.
-  They cover bareness and furnish a room even without furniture.
-  They can change the apparent size of a room or conceal architectural flaws.

## TYPES OF CURTAINS

Glass curtains: These are made of sheer fabrics of simple straight-line covering the entire window area with draperies.

<!-- image -->

Sash  curtains: These  are  made  of  sheer  fabrics  and  lightweight  material  with decorative ruffles.  They are fixed on the frame or wall by special fixtures.

Casement curtains: These cover the entire window and have casing at both top and bottom

<!-- image -->

Criss cross curtains: Wide panels are mounted on walls so that they overlap on the top and are tied back.

Café  Curtains: Short  curtains  that  cover  the  portion  of  a  window  often  hung  on decorative rods by means of rings.

<!-- image -->

Cottage curtains: These are combination of café and sash curtains.

Tier curtains: Two or more horizontal rows of short curtains, which are mounted on rods so that they overlap.

Tie back :  Either one panel can be ti back to one side or both the panels an be tied back to two sides. They are often tied back to the window frame.

<!-- image -->

Vertical  draw  curtain: These  are  mounted  on  traverse  tracks  so  that  they  can  be drawn open.

Vertical drop curtain: These are curtains, which move up and down and are found in theatres and cinema halls.

## DECORATIVE HEADINGS

Curtain headings and accessories We shall  now look at the various headings and accessories used with curtains.

<!-- image -->

Pelmets and cornices: Cornices are box-like shapes used  at  the  top  horizontal  portion  of  the  drapery treatment to hide the poles and other hardware.

Valances: These  are  made  of  fabric  that  has  been

<!-- image -->

pleated,  scalloped  or  ruffled.  They  should  never  exceed  one-sixth  of  the  window's height and should be about 8-12 inches in depth.

Swag and Tail curtains: These  are  heading  at  the  top  of  the  curtains  and  form  an integral part of the decoration. This is generally meant to hide the curtain headings.

Drapery cranes : These are the appropriate hardware to use where installations have to be flexible.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Traverse and decorative rods: These  are  used  in  conjunction  with  runners,  which are hooked onto the curtain. They come in many types. The conventional traverse rod is used with classic pleated draperies that pull away from the centre to either side.

Curtain  rods: This  is  a  very  old  curtain-hanging  tradition.  They  come  in  many beautiful and durable designs, with a wide range of length options. Spacers in curtain rods extend outward from the wall for depth or to accommodate multiple rods. Both rod-pocket  and  tab-  top  curtains  can  be  difficult  to  open  or  close  on  telescoping curtain rods. While hidden by many medium-weight and heavyweight materials, rods are visible through sheer curtains, and ring-top

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Measurement and Installation of curtains: Curtains are fixed to the track by rings or hook and drop to the floor or windowsill.  The fabric for the curtain should be a large piece hanging in folds with the entire pattern visible.  It is better to avoid fabrics with white background in large establishments.  The general width of the material may be 90 cms, 120 cms, 150 cms or more.  The curtain width should be a minimum of one and half times the track width.  Lining the curtain helps to protect from dirt or sunlight  and  provides  good  drape.   Silk  fabrics  are  expensive  and  usually  used  in luxury  establishments  in  public  areas  and  suites.  Brocades,  damasks,  velvet's  and  a variety of weaves may be used. For the bedroom, a lighter material like cotton, linen, chintz, satin etc may be used.  In bathrooms, a heavy window does not require curtains but nylon, plastic and glass fibre material are often used for shower curtains.  Plastics may easily dry but may tear easily.

## General points in curtain construction

-  Velvet and pile fabric should hang with the pile running downwards.
-  15-30 cms should be allowed for hem and turning on each curtain.
-  For floor length curtains, it should be 1. ould be one and half times or 2 times the width of the track.
-  The curtain heading may be gathered, pleated or held with tapes.
-  Lining should be fixed at the top and side of the curtain but not attached at the hem.
-  Hems and sides should  be  hand  sewn  but  5  -  2.5  cms.  above  floor  level  to prevent friction.
-  The minimum width for any curtain sh
-  not machine stitched.
-  Heavy curtains may have weights or chains at the hem to improve the hang.
-  Flame retardant fabrics should be used in public rooms.
-  Draw cords or curtain controls should be used to pull the curtain.

## 3.6.2 Selection of Window Treatment

When it comes to decorating, there is one element in the room that is often forgotten, and  that  is  the window  treatments .  Most  people  will  purchase  curtains  as  an afterthought, something that needs to go up but doesn't really matter. The problem is the  window treatments  do  matter  and  it  should  be  an  active  decision  when  you  are designing  your  decor.  Selecting  the  right window  curtains can  be  surprisingly complex. If you choose the wrong type or the wrong color, it can completely ruin the design that you have. Finding the best curtains for your room can lead to a flow in style  that  will  have  any  professional  interior  designer borrowing from  your idea for future projects.  If  you are trying to select window treatments for your home but are unsure of where to start, there are a few pointers that will help make finding the right window curtains much easier.

Keep the curtains in the room: This is actually a mistake that many people make. They find a curtain style and they put the same curtains into every room whether it looks  good  with  the  decor  or  not.  The  simple  fact  is  each  room  can  have  different curtains, unless you are working with an open floor concept

Understand your privacy: One of the more popular window treatments that you can find are sheer drapes. While these are wonderful in many different areas, they are not

the best style of drape to purchase if you want to have a little privacy since you can see through most sheer drapes. Bedrooms should never have sheer drapes solely, and neither  should  bathrooms  for  that  matter.  Instead,  pair  them  with  a  darker  drape  or window covering that does just that; covers.

Understand the lighting: When it comes to windows, not all of them produce the same amount of lighting and this will affect the type of drapes that you use. Drapes that are heavy can block out a lot of light and this works well in a bedroom, especially bedrooms that offer amazing views of the sunrise. Sheer drapes are excellent for sun rooms  that  don't  need  a  lot  of  privacy.  Sheers  provide  a  light  airy  feel  that  work wonderfully in many spaces. When you know the amount of light coming through the window, you can plan accordingly.

## 3.7 Bed and Bedding

A bed is a piece of furniture or location primarily used as a place to rest, relax, nap or sleep.  To  make  beds  more  comfortable,  the  top  layer  is  frequently  a  mattress. Originally these were bags of straw for most people and filled with fluffy, feathers of birds for the wealthy. Eventually new filling materials such as cotton, silk cotton and artificial fillers became common. In modern times most mattresses use springs, solid foam, latex, water, or air. As time passes on more and more people are looking for a better medium to sleep, since people spend a large percentage of time in life in a bed. It has become a more recent realization for many, to attribute health deteriorations to what they lay on. Water resilient fibers (natural and synthetic), latex, synthetic foams and a combination of  a  huge  range  of  different  spring  technologies  are  used  in  the manufacture of beds. For greater head support, most people use a pillow, placed at the top of a mattress. Also used is some form of covering blanket to provide warmth to the sleeper, often bed sheets, a quilt, or a duvet.

Also, some people prefer to dispense with the box spring and bed frame, and replace it with a platform bed style. This is more common in Europe.

## Construction of beds

Most beds consist of following parts:

A Frame: on which the spring and mattress rest this is usually a rectangular, metal or wooden framework, some having raised edge all around o that the mattress fits in and is held in place.

A  Base: which  may  be  made  of  open  coiled  spring,  wire  mesh  or  laminated wooden strips to provide resilience and support.

A Mattress: which lies on the top of the spring and provides extra padding.

A Headboard: made of painted or varnished wood or an upholstered type. In most hotels, headboards are not part of the beds. They are typically mounted on the wall behind the beds and not on the frames. The main objective of the headboard is to protect the wall from developing greasy stains from a guest's head. To fulfill this purpose, the headboard must rise up to 30-45 cm above the top of the mattress.

A  Footboard: usually  made  of  wood  or  metal  and  lower  in  height  than  the headboard

## BED FRAMES

There are basically two types of bed frames:

- 1. Platform  Frames/  Box  Frames: These  are  usually  made  from  wood.  They provide the bed spring and mattress with a platform or box on which to rest. While platform frames are raised off the floor by feet, box frames lie tight to the floor.
- 2. Metal  Frames: These  consist  of  four  length  of  angle  iron  with  a  metal  leg attached to each corner. Larger beds also have two cross bars added for extra support. These metal legs may have castor or furniture glides attached to them.

Base spring: Spring add resiliency and durability to the bed. They are made by j wire spring  or  coils  together  and  covering  them  with  padding.  There  are  primarily  four types of spring constructions:

- 1. Box Spring: The coils for these are made of heavy gauge steel. Box springs are mounted on a wood frame and covered with a pad.
- 2. Metal Coil Spring: These may be arranged in two layers. The springs on the bottom  are  tightly  coiled  for  good  support.  The  top  are  loosely  coiled  for resilience.
- 3. Flat  Bed  Spring: The  strips  of  metal  attached  length  wise  to  a  frame  with helical hooks. These hooks are small coils with hooks at both ends.
- 4. Stretched spring: These are in the form of highly coiled springs attached to the  frame  on  one  side  and  resilient  thick  metal  wires  on  the  other  side.  The wire crisscross each other and cover the middle of the frame with the spring lying on the sides.

## 3.7.1   Types of Beds

- 1. Cribs: These are available as guest loan items in hotel and usually collapsible to  save  storage  space.  They  should  have  adequate  locking  mechanisms  to ensure that they do not collapse when the infant or a child is put to sleep in them.
- 2. Rollway Zed Beds: Zed beds get their name from their three-part folded frame resembling the letter 'Z'. These can be rollway beds on roller or castors. They generally  have  a  thin  latex  foam  mattress  that  rest  on  a  base  of  stretched springs attached to rectangular folded frame.
- 3. Sofa Beds: These provide extra seating by day and a bed by night.
- 4. Murphy  or  Sico  Beds: These  beds  fold  up  to  into  the  wall,  giving  the impression of a book shelf, a wardrobe or a cabinet. Rooms with these types of beds can be used for meetings by day and a bedroom a night.
- 5. Canopy Bed: A canopy bed is a decorative bed somewhat similar to a fourposter bed. Canopy is supported by four-posters.
- 6. Trundled Bed: A Tuckle bed (or trundle bed ) is a bed that are stored under a normal bed and that can be wheeled out for use by visitors.
- 7. Bunk Bed: A Bunk bed is a type of bed in which one bed frame is stacked on the top of another.

- 8. Loft Bed: A loft bed is an elevated bed similar to a bunk bed but without the lower beds-freeing floor space for other furniture (such as a desk) which might be built into loft bed.
- 9. Hammock: A hammock is a sling mode of fabric, rope or netting, suspended between two points used for swinging, sleeping or resting.

## 3.8 Mattresses

An  ideal  mattress  should  give  support  and  at  the  same  time  conforms  to  the  body contours. When choosing mattresses, it should be kept in mind that they should be at least 6 inches longer than the average sleeper's height.

Construction of mattress: Consist of Three components:

Ticking/Upper  Layer: It  is  the  thick  protective  fabric  and  covers  inn  side  off mattress. It can be made of cotton, polyester and stain.

Topper: It is the soft foam stitched along with inner side of ticking for better support.

Core/Filling: Cotton foam, Jute, Cotton fibre, Kapok.

## 3.8.1 Types of Mattresses

There are primarily five of mattresses:

Interior-Spring  Mattress: These  mattresses  have  a  liner  layer  of  springs between  layers  of  insulation  and  padding.  Interior  spring  mattresses  are  of three types:

Open-Spring  Mattresses: These have hourglass-shaped wire coiled sandwiched between wire frames.

Pocketed-Spring Mattresses: The springs in these are cylindrical and each is enclosed in a fabric or a foam pocket.

Continuous-Spring Mattresses: In these, the springs are made from wire that is linked and interweaved in a wire-mesh like pattern.

Latex or Foam Rubber Mattress: These are made from synthetic rubber that is whipped into foam with a chemical setting agent while in a semi-liquid state and poured into heated moulds. In the moulds, the foam gets shaped set and vulcanized without losing any of its tiny air cells.

Solid Stuffed Mattresses: These mattresses are made by filling a ticking with padding. The padding may be in the form of animal hair, cotton, kapok, wool, coil or flock.

Plastic Mattress: These are made from polyethene and vinyl foam. They are non-absorbent and resistant o attack by month and other pests.

Water  Mattresses: These  resemble  interior-spring  mattress  in  appearance. Well designed ones have water filled cells in the centre of the mattress. These cells are covered with vinyl-covered urethane foam.

SELECTION OF MATTRESSES: The following attributes must be checked when selecting mattress:

Firmness: The firmness should be consistent across all parts of mattress.

Construction: Most  expensive  mattress  typically  has  a  damask  ticking,  thicker padding higher coil counts and a cushion swin into the mattress.

Softness: Mattress should be soft and contact points; if not body will begin to ache, causing one to turn and not sleep well.

Appearance: Examine the colour, fabric and stitch pattern to assess quality.

Ticking: This  is  a  mattress  outer  most  layer.  Most  are  made  of  cotton-polyester  or vinyl. Vinyl is used in cheaper mattresses. The blanket sticking should be sturdy, with a weight of at least 170 gms per square inch.

Quilting and Top Padding: Most mattress have a few layer of padding attached to the ticking.

Insulated Padding: This padding lies directly on the top of the spring to prevent them from being felt.

Coil Count: There should e more than 300 coils with a minimum of 13 gauges wire full size version.

Handle: Most mattresses include handles to use when positioning the mattress. They are not meant for carrying the fall weight.

Box  Spring  (foundation): Box  Spring  foundations  provide  extra  softness  and comfort. They can be simply a wooden frame covered with board.

## Care and maintenance

-  Alternately  rotating  and  flipping  the  mattress  on  a  periodic  basis  can  help minimize body impression.
-  Use mattress handles for rotating.
-  Foam  mattress  do  not  need  turning;  however  the  single  layers  one  may  be turned.
-  The mattress and base should be cleaned with a soft brush every month.
-  Do not use vacuum cleaner on a daily basis.
-  Check for tears, distorted springs or any other damage periodically.
-  Five  mattress  fresh  air  and  allow  them  to  breathe  for  15  minutes-other guestroom cleaning tasks may be complete during this time.
-  Use mattress protector.
-  Use trolley for shifting mattresses.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

DUVETS/ QUILTS: Provides  a  warm  light  bed  covering  but  are  quite  expensive initially. They may be used as such or given a fabric covering.  Satin, polyester, silk and  good  quality  fabrics  are  suitable  for  the  top  layer  of  the  quilts.   Less  slippery material like satin or linen may be used for under layer to prevent slipping.  Duvets have  become  increasingly  popular  in  hotels  and  are  fast  replacing  the  blanket, especially on double beds. They consist of a filling sandwiched or stitched in a fabric case with a changeable cover. The fillers may be duck/goose down, a feather mix or a combination of the two. The down feathers  are  the  small,  fluffy  feathers.  Although they  are  warmer,  professional  cleaning  is  necessary  and  they  are  heavier  and  more expensive than their synthetic counterparts. The synthetic filling is usually polyester fibres.  These  duvets  are  lighter  and  can  be  washed  in  large-capacity  washing machines. Even if the establishment uses natural fillings to provide the best degree of comfort, a small stock of duvets filled with man-made fibres should be made available for anyone who has an allergy to the natural product. It is essential for the duvet to have  an  outside  cover.  Changing  a  duvet  cover  is  a  skill  which  is  developed  with practice. To save laundry costs and labour, it is advisable to provide a covering sheer in  conjunction  with  the  duvet  cover.  Though  it  is  common  to  have  all  of  them  in white,  the  duvet  cover,  the  bottom  sheet  and  valance  could  be  part  of  the  colour scheme of the guest room.

## Care and maintenance of Duvets and quilts:

-  Mend  any  tar  and  damage  as  soon  as  possible.  Remove  stains  and  grease marks immediately by dry-cleaning.
-  Follow  the  manufacturer's  instructions  for  regular  cleaning  of  duvets  and quilts.
-  Always use duvets and quilts with easily launder able covers, so that these can be removed and washed separately.
-  The cover of a duvet should be 2-4 inches larger than duvet on each side to give it room to expand. Smooth out duvets and quilts with a light hand while making  the  bed.  When  storing  feather  filled  quilts  and  duvets  use  mothrepellent chemicals.

Pillows  and  Bolsters: The  best  and  most  expensive  pillows  are  filled  with  down. Others have a mixture of down and feathers and some are filled with manmade fibres. Foam pillow are suitable for people allergic to dust and feathers. Feather pillows don't last long. Foam pillows may also last for 10 years. Kapok, the cotton like fibre from the seeds of the silk-cotton tree, was earlier used as a filling for pillows; but it is not used for pillows in hotels now since kapok -filled pillows cannot be laundered or drycleaned. Bolsters are elongated pillow used on settees, divans and beds. In the past, they sometimes formed an under-pillow; but they are not use on the bed any more.

## Care and maintenance of Pillow and bolsters:

-  Dust and shake pillow lightly before making the bed
-  Any damage  to the ticking should be repaired immediately
-  If the pillows have the synthetic filling, they may be washed individually on a regular  basis.  Pillows  with  natural  filling  should  be  dry-cleaned  when necessary.
-  Latex and foam pillow can be wiped clean.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Bedspread/Bedcover/Counterpane: These  are  purchased,  considering  appearance, durability and size. The colour and print should match the décor, and soil should not show  easily.  The  fabric  should  drape  well  and  not  crease  easily  (quilted  for  this purpose).  The  durability  of  the  fabric  is  judged  by  the  effect  of  laundering  and constant use. The life expectancy may be totally disregarded in order to meet with a certain decorative colour scheme. Readymade bedcovers lack individuality so they are usually  stitched  and  a  number  of  styles  are  possible.  Bedcovers  should  be interchangeable wherever possible.

## Care and maintenance of Bedspread/Bedcover/Counterpane:

-  Any damage should be repaired as soon as it is detected.
-  Conventional blankets should be laundered or dry-cleaned when necessary.
-  Stains grease marks should be removed by spot-cleaning or dry-cleaning.
-  On a daily basis, while making the bed, gently shake out the blankets

Cushion: It  may  be  used  to  increase  the  comfort  of  chairs  and  sofas  and  provide colour pattern and texture to the room.  They may be fitted to form a seat or a back; or may be used loosely as scatter cushions.  Shapes may vary from square, rectangular, circular, triangular, semi-circular to bolsters, which are elongated pillows. They will be filled with down, feathers, kappa, rubber, polyfill, urethane foam, thermo coal ball, silk cotton, foam plastic etc.

## Care and maintenance

Cushions require constant attention

-  Shake and tidy frequently
-  Repair when necessary
-  Brush and suction clean regularly
-  Remove covers and wash or dry clean.

## 3.10 Flower arrangement

Flower  arrangement  is  a  design  of  beauty.   It  is  essentially  a  decorative  piece  and should be the centre of attraction. An arrangement can be composed of only flowers and  or  foliage  or  in  combination  with  vegetables  and  fruits.   Flower  arrangements have  an  ability  to  introduce  a  personal  touch  in  an  otherwise  staid  and  impersonal hotel  room.   Arrangements  can  be  used  in  lobbies,  restaurants,  suites  etc.   Guests appreciate  flowers  for  the  freshness  they  bring  to  the  surroundings.   Arrangements need not be reserved only for parties or special occasions.  They can be used regularly depending upon the season and the theme. Unconventional and dry material can also be used to make arrangements which are more economical and last longer.

## 3.10.1 Principles of Flower Arrangement

The  principles  of  design  are  applicable  to  flower  arrangement  as  well.   Design determines  the  structural  pattern  of  the  arrangement.   It  consists  of  the  relationship between the flowers, foliage and containers.  Any design can be produced i.e. suitable to  the  occasion  and  the  surroundings.   Design  is  determined  by  site  of  placement, function and materials available.  Arrangements may have also to be two sided or all round.

Balance: Materials should be placed to give a feeling of stability.  Form and colour are important aspects of balance.

## a)

- Formal balance or Symmetrical Balance: In this type, both sides have equal material on either side of the central line. The flowers should have equal visual weight and colour.

## b) Informal or Asymmetrical Balance

In this, two sides are not equal but still have equal visual weight.  Dark colours give an effect of more weight than light colours.  They should be centred low in  the  arrangement.   Lighter  colours  give  an  impression  of  lightness  and  are more suitable towards the outer and upper ends of arrangement.

Scale: It  means proportion and relationship of the various parts of the composition. The plant material has to be in proportion with the container used and the sealing of the plant items with each other must be kept in mind along with the site and function. A flower arrangement is of good proportion when it is of right side for the container and placement.

Rhythm: Rhythm can be described as a sense of movement, which flows through the main lines of the arrangement.  The purpose of it is to direct once eyes along it so that the  shape  of  the  entire  composition  is  followed  and  understood.   In  flower arrangement  this  is  achieved  by  grading  flowers  and  arranging  foliage,  leaning towards the sides.  These lines partly decide the design of arrangement.

Focal  Point: It  is  the  central  point  of  arrangement  where  emphasis  is  obtained  by large accented flowers, group of flowers or use of darker colours.

Harmony  and  Unity: Ensure  that  the  materials  are  suitable  for  the  site  and  the occasion.  The colours of the flowers and the container should blend with each other easily or provide a pleasing contrast with each other and with the background.  Unity of  materials  is  necessary  to  view  the  arrangement  without  any  distraction  from  the main line of movement.

## Basic ingredients

-  Mechanics
-  Equipment
-  Containers
-  Bases
-  Accessories
-  Plant material
-  Support

Mechanics : These are items used to keep flowers, foliage, and stems in place within the container. Mechanics must be fixed securely and should be hidden from view. Examples - florists' foam (oasis), pin holders (Japanese term - kenzan), chicken wire,

prong, adhesive clay and tape, florist cone.

Floral foam ,  also called oasis ,  is  a  cellular plastic material, available in two types green foam and brown/grey foam.

Pin-holders ,  also  called kenzan  or  needle-point  holders ,  is  a  series  of  sharply pointed  pins  are  firmly  held  in  a  solid  lead  base,  to  hold  thick  and  heavy  stems securely by impaling them on the pins.

Chicken wire, also called 'wire mesh' or 'wire netting' , is a fine- gauge wire used to cover floral foam blocks in large displays.

Prong is  the  simplest type of floral foam anchor. It is a small plastic disc with four vertical prongs. The base of the prong is attached to the container with adhesive clay and the floral foam is pressed down onto the prongs.

Florist's cone, also called a ‗ flower tube' or ‗ flower funnel' . It acts like a miniature vase.  It  is  used  in  large  arrangements,  where  foliage  or  flowers  need  to  be  placed above their stem height.

Equipment :  This  includes  tools  used  to  ensure  t  hat  a  satisfactory  arrangement  of plant material is created within the container.

Examples - bucket, scissors, knife, watering can, mister, wire cutter, cocktail sticks, turn, wire, floral tape, candle holder, cut flower preservatives, and secateurs.

Mister: It is a hand- held spray bottle to produce a fine mist of water droplets to keep an arrangement look fresh in warm weather.

Secateurs: They are used to cut through thick and woody stems Cocktail sticks or a tooth pick: It is used to make holes in florists' foam for a soft stem of flower.

Cut-flower preservatives: It is  a  bactericide,  available in powder or liquid form, to prevent slime and smell from developing in the vase water, plus sugar to prolong the life of fresh flowers. A preservative can be made in-house by adding 3 teaspoons of sugar and 1 drop of bleach to half a litre of water.

Containers: These  are  receptacles  that  hold  the  flower  arrangement.  They  may  or may  not  be  hidden  by  the  plant  material.  The  container  must  be  waterproof   and neutral  colours  such  as  soft  grey,  dull  brown,  off-white,  or  earth  colours  are  most suitable  because  they  are  inconspicuous  and  do  not  detract  attention  from  flowers displayed. Theme and simplicity should be kept in mind while choosing the design of the container.

Example - vases and jugs, basket, bowls and trays, wreath frame etc.

Bases: An object that is placed underneath the container to protect the surface of the support and/or to add to the beauty of the display is called a base.

Example - table mat, tree section, wood base, stone base, and oriental base.

Support: This refers to the structure on which the container stands.

Example - tables, sideboards, alcoves, and shelves.

Other equipments: Florists tape, foam, water spray, rubber bands, tooth picks, thin wire, rocks, pebbles, accessories like birds, butter flies, figurines, sheds etc. A sink, running water and working surface with storage area must be provided.

PLANT MATERIALS : These can be divided into 3 basic types-

Flowers (dominant/ focal/ point material ) : This consists of bold flowers or clusters of small showy blooms. The dominant material provides a centre of interest.

Example  -  Gerbera,  Chrysanthemum,  lilies,  Anthurium,  Tulips,  Poppies,  Roses, Dahlias, and Daffodils.

Fillers (secondary material ) : This consists of smaller flowers and all sorts of leaves and foliage that are used to cover the mechanics and edges of the container and also provide added interest and colour to the display.

Example  -  Asters,  Ivy,  Button  Chrysanthemum,  Carnations,  Gypsophila  (Baby's breath), Limonium and Marguerites.

Foliages ( line material ) : This consists of tall stems, flowering spikes, or bold leaves that  are  used  to  create  the  basic  framework  or  skeleton.  This  line  material  may  be straight or curved and it sets the height and width of the finished arrangement.

Examples - Gladioli, birds of paradise, golden rods, larkspur, asparagus ferns, palms, tuberoses, and Peruvian lilies.

Accessories: These  are  non-plant  materials  included  in  or  placed  alongside  the arrangement. Their purpose in generally decorative but could be functional at times. Accessories are added to the design for extra interest or to ‗stretch' the flowers when they are in short supply.

Example - miniature dolls, hats, ribbons, beads, painted wire,  wooden  fruit shapes, silk flowers and foliage, candles, driftwood, shells, idols, interesting pebbles etc.

Care  and  conditioning  of  flowers: A flower  or  leaf  cut  from  a  plant  has  a  short, though beautiful, life. It is possible to prolong this for a little while by a few methods. Flower arrangers use the term ‗ conditioning ' to refer to the preparation of cut plant materials for a long life, the filling of stems with water, and prevention of wilting.

- 1. A bucket of water at room temperature should be carried into the garden and the cut flowers should be immediately plunged into it. This helps retain their moisture for a longer period of time.
- 2. Plant  material  should  be  cut  at  a  slant,  using  sharp  scissors  or  knife,  either early in the morning or after sunset. At this time, they are crisp and filled with moisture.
- 3. As a general rule, it is best to cut flowers before they reach maturity.
- 4. Carry cut flowers in a heads-down position so that heavy-headed flowers will not snap off.
- 5. Wrap the flowers in newspaper till the neck of the flowers. Plunge this bunch into a bucket of water for 3-4 hours or overnight to condition. This is called ‗ hardening' . In case of foliage, submerge them in water for about 2 hours.
- 6. Use  a  good  pruning  knife  or  scissors  to  make  clean,  slanting  cuts,  causing minimal damage or bruising to the little ducts in the stem which carry water.
- 7. Make slanting cuts in stems rather than straight ones - preferably underwater, as this helps expose a larger surface area for water suction by the stems.
- 8. When  stems  are  woody,  they  may  be  cut  crushed  or  split  at  the  end,  e.g. cherry, etc.
- 9. To revive  wilting  flowers,  snip  off  half  an  inch  of  the  stem  underwater  and plunge in a deep container of water. Dead flowers should be cut off.
- 10. Re-cut  any  stem  that  has  been  left  out  of  water,  doing  this  underwater  if possible and removing about 2 inches of the stem.
- 11. To reduce underwater decay, strip the stems of all foliage and thorns that fall below the waterline

- 12. Never  place  a  fresh  flower  arrangement  where  it  will  be  exposed  to  direct draughts  from  a  fan  or  window.  To  prevent  dehydration,  keep  cut  flowers away from direct sunlight and large appliances as well.
- 13. Do not put flowers near a bowl of citrus fruits as they emit ethylene gas when ripening, which causes wilting of flowers.
- 14. Prolong  the  freshness  of  the  arrangement  by  spraying  with  lukewarm  water from a mister morning and night.
- 15. Change the water every day if the arrangement is meant to last a while. Never use  chilled  water,  as  cut  stems  fare  best  in  warm  water  of  about  45  degree Celsius.
- 16. Listerine, ammonia, charcoal, salt, lemonade, sugar, camphor, aspirin added in small  amounts  to  the  water,  or  commercial  cut-flower  preservatives  slows down bacterial growth, thus prolonging the life of flowers.
- 17. Use clean containers to prevent premature fouling and bacterial growth. Do not use aluminium containers for flowers.
- 18. Every 3 days, re-cut the stems, clean the vase, completely replace the water, and add more preservative.

## 3.10.2 Styles of Flower Arrangement

## Based on angle

All-round arrangements : This arrangement is designed to be seen from all sides and is therefore chosen for a table or a room centerpiece.

## Facing arrangement/ flat-back arrangement

It is designed to be seen only from the front and perhaps from the sides. It is therefore chosen for placement on a shelf or sideboard.

## Based on the space present in the arrangement

Mass style :  Little  or  no  space  is  enclosed  within  the  boundary  of  the  arrangement. This style is originated in Europe.

Line style : In this style, open spaces within the boundary of the arrangement  are the main feature. Most of the display is line material. The basic feature of a line design is limited use of plant material with support often provided by a pin holder.

Triangular shape : It is a popular shape for symmetrical arrangements. The first step is to establish lines of height and width, usually with flowers or foliage of finer form or  paler  colour.  The  next  step  is  to  establish  a  focal  point  of  interest  with  large  or darker-colored flowers. Fill in with flowers of varied stem lengths, grouping colours. Left triangle- It is made in a shallow container with consecutive stem along the left side.  Right triangle- like the left triangle arrangement, but the tallest stem on the right side of the container with consecutive stem.

Vertical  line :  A  very  tall  arrangement  placed  in  long  and  cylindrical  flower  vase using a very long stemmed flower like torch lilies.

Line mass style : In this style, some open space is present within the boundary of the arrangement.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Circular shape :  or round shape, is an arrangement in which flowers are arranged in circular designs.

Crescent shape :  it is asymmetrical and formal arrangement which requires more skill and experience.

Fan  shape :  The  fan  or  horizontal  shape  is   a  good  line  to  follow  when  designing flowers  for  the  centre  of  the  table.  It  is  a  low  arrangement,  symmetrical  and  thus attractive from every angle.

Hogarth or 'S' shape : This style was pioneered by an 18 th century painter, William Hogarth.  This  is  a  very  graceful  and  easier  to  make  arrangement  when  curved branches and pliable stems are used. After establishing the S shape with these, flowers are filled in at the centre and just above and below the rim of the tall container.

Different shapes of flower arrangement

<!-- image -->

IKEBANA (Japanese/  Oriental  flower  arrangement ): The  word  literally  means ‗ making flowers live' in  Japanese.  This  Japanese  style  has  been  practiced  for thousands of years. These arrangements are more than an aesthetic grouping of plant materials. They are symbolic representations of an ideal harmony that exists between earthly and eternal life. In each arrangement, there is an imaginary triangle. Its tallest line  represents  ‗heaven'.  Facing  and  looking  towards  heaven  is  ‗man'.  The  lowest line, looking up to both, is ‗earth'. In all such arrangements, Heaven, man and earth are represented by means of three main branches.

Shin : The main spray, is the tallest and symbolizes heaven; it ends to the central axis of the vase. This stem should be 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the height of the container.

See: The second highest stem represents man. It provides width to the arrangement and is about three-fourth the height of the tallest spray. This stem forms an angle of about 45 degree with the rim of the container.

Hikae :  The  lowest  spray  denotes  earth.  This  branch  is  about  half  as  tall  as  the  one signifying man and extends very little beyond the diameter of the container, forming an angle of about 115 degrees with the rim of the container. It is placed opposite the branch signifying man and is used to balance the arrangement.

-  The Japanese use tall vases as well as low bowls.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

-  They always use an odd number of flowers, as they believe that odd numbers are lucky as well as more aesthetic. Thus, in all arrangements, three, five, or seven flower sprays are used.
-  There is no overcrowding and all the plant materials are seen as separate units, but as a part of the whole.
-  There are various schools of oriental flower arrangement.

Ikebana style

<!-- image -->

## OHARA School is the most popular one. In this school-

-  When a flat or low container is used, it is called a moribana style. Moribana is an informal arrangement in a shallow container in which a pin-holder is used as  mechanics.  Landscapes  are  portrayed  or  large,  colourful  flowers  are displayed.
-  When a tall vase without a pin-holder is used, the arrangement is said to be in the hikae style.
-  A formal arrangement, basically a triangular one is called the seika style which has strict rules governing the lengths and angles of the stems.
-  A floating arrangement is called ukibana .
-  A basket arrangement is morimano .
-  A classical  arrangement in a tall  cylindrical  vase  with  a  flowing  and  natural effect is called nagerie .

## Miscellaneous style -

-  Parallel style/ European style
-  Landscape style
-  Foliage arrangement
-  Dried flower arrangement

## Essentials in flower arrangement

- 1.         A good design                                     4.         Flower composition
- 2.         Right shape                                         5.         Accessories in the arrangement
- 3.         Colour of the container

While  starting  the  arrangement,  make  a  definite  mental  plan.   Design  on  the  basic form in such a way that taller and wider material goes first in a definite leading line. Locate the focal point low and near the centre.  Let the plant material partially cover the container.  Avoid even number of flowers except in a formal arrangement.  Keep the height of flowers 1/2 times the width of container. Place tall arrangements in tall containers but low containers can be used for both kinds of arrangements. Two items must  never  appear  at  the  same  height.  Stems  can  be  bent  to  obtain  curves  in  the

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

arrangement.  Avoid crossing of stems and observe the reflection of the arrangement in a mirror.

Use  of  dry  material  in  flower  arrangement: A dry  flower  arrangement  is  a  long lasting arrangement that is made by using dried flower material.  Most dry material can  be  collected  in  autumn.   Examples  of  the  materials  for  such  arrangements  are stems of barley, oats, rice etc. Pine cones, wood roses, bull roses, onion seed heads, poppy  seed  heads,  corn  cobs,  lichen,  wired  shaped  roots,  dried  grass,  feathers,  sea weed,  dried  lotus,  Cyprus  palm  etc.    This  material  can  be  treated  with  a  coat  of varnish, paint or silver and gold wash.  Accessories like marbles, coloured glass, bits of metals or strips of metal foil, dried berries, feathers, pebbles, drift wood, ribbons, thremocoal balls, candles, bells, glass balls can be used.

Flower  arrangement  is  a  very  old  art.  Making  up  of  a  good  flower  arrangement requires  a  lot  of  creativity  and  one  can  develop  this  art  through  study  and experimentation with different plant materials.

Flower  arrangement may  be defined  as  the  art  of  organizing  and  grouping  together plant materials (flowers, foliage, twigs, etc.) to achieve harmony of form, colour, and texture, thereby adding cheer, life, and beauty to the surroundings.

## Styles of flower arrangement on the basis of effect

-  Formal arrangement -this is symmetrical and precise.
-  Semi-formal arrangement -  this  is  more or less symmetrical in outline, but not in the details of arrangement
-  Informal arrangement - this is asymmetrical and ‗free'.
-  Modern or abstract or free-style arrangement -  these  have no fixed rules for correct proportions. These arrangements do not have a definite geometric outline;  instead  the  emphasis  is  on  line  and  space.  The  individual  beauty  of each piece of plant material is emphasized instead of the beauty of an outline shape or a mass.

Flower  arrangements  in  hotels: In  hotels,  flowers  are  used  extensively.  Various types of arrangements are chosen, as appropriate to the area and occasion. Mediumsized ‗round' arrangements are often provided at the guest relations executives' desk in the lobby and on coffee tables in the lounges. In most five star hotels, one can see huge, spectacular arrangements in the lobbies. Restaurants generally have bud vases on each table, with one or two flowers in them. Table arrangements for conferences must  be  low  so  that  guests  may  see  over  them.  At  informal  banquets,  large arrangements may be seen. At wedding banquets, wall arrangements using gerberas are  very  popular  nowadays.  On  special  occasions  and  festivals,  some  hotels  even make beautiful traditional flower carpets for the lobby.

Flowers are used for decorating various areas in the hotel like restaurants, reception area,  lobby  area,  rooms  etc.   They  provide  a  cheerful  appearance  and  colour  to  the room.  The arrangement should blend with the décor of the room.  It should be suited to the occasion and location.

Arrangements for VIP Rooms: Arrangements  here offer  a  great  variety  in  design and imagination.  The placement will vary according to the type of room and its décor. The  writing  table,  bedside  table  or  coffee  table  should  be  used  for  placing  tall arrangements.  The flowers used in rooms should not attract insects.

Flower arrangements for reception area: The reception desk is the first area that the guest  comes  in  contact  with.   This  desk  becomes  part  of  the  lounge  or  lobby. Arrangements  should  lend  character  and  cheerfulness  to  the  surroundings.   They should  blend  with  the  décor.  Roses,  tuberoses  and  gladioli,  chrysanthemums, carnations etc are most suitable.  The arrangement may be two-dimensional since it needs to be viewed by the guest.

Buffet Table: Flower arrangements on buffet table act as centrepieces and focus of attention.   The  basic  rules  of  arrangements  in  dining  area  should  be  followed  and  a

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

multi-  tier  arrangement  of  a  combination  with  fruits  and  carved  vegetables  can  be made.   Flowers  used  should  not  have  a  strong  smell.   Theme  arrangements  can  be made in theme restaurants.

Banquet Table: A banquet is a formal sit down service and the flower arrangement must also  follow  a  formal  pattern.   The  colour  should  blend  harmoniously  with  the décor of the banquet hall.  A table that is large with a seating capacity of 15-20 guests, should  have  at  least  4-5  small  arrangements.   These  should  be  low  and  all  round. Flower arrangement for special banquets like wedding banquets or in honour of VIP guests should be formal and usually monochromatic.

Coffee Table: For a coffee table a low mass arrangement that can be viewed from all sides  is  suitable.   Few  large  flowers  combined  with  tiny  blossoms  are  appropriate. Arrangements can be informal and relaxing.

## 4.1 Introduction

Housekeeping should  provide  a  safe  and  healthy  environment  for  residents  and visitors, and cleaning of common spaces plays a vital role. By definition, cleaning is the  removal  of  unwanted  matter,  dust  and  dirt  and  contaminants,  the  prevention  of soiling;. The proverbial godliness attached to cleanliness is one of the basic criteria for a  satisfied  guest  to  return  to  a  hotel.  A  professional  and  well-run  housekeeping department is key to running a successful hotel operation. Cleanliness is important for many reasons, not the least of which is the impact it has on guests, as well as keeping long  term  maintenance  costs  down.  The  housekeeping  staffs  have  the  most  direct contact with the guests' rooms and therefore, are the key to ensuring that the guests have  a  comfortable  and  pleasant  stay.  The  importance  and  influence  of  the housekeeping department in developing repeat clientele cannot be over emphasised. Cleanliness, safety and security are three of the highest requirements of the travelling public. T he various cleaning agents, cleaning equipments and cleaning procedures are discussed in this lesson.

## 4.2Objectives

At the end of this lesson, students should be able to demonstrate appropriate skills, and show an understanding of the following:

-  Cleaning agents and Cleaning equipments.
-  Use cleaning agents and equipment safely and properly

-  Describe the best cleaning method to use for a particular application
-  Discuss the method of cleaning and maintaining metal surfaces.

## 4.3 Cleaning agents

A cleaning agent removes or assists in removing or removes physically or chemically any  soil  from  the  surface.  Dust  being  composed  of  loose  particles,  is  removed comparatively easily by the use of various piece of equipment; dirt, however, owing to its adherence to surfaces by means of grease or moisture requires the use of cleaning agents  as  well  as  equipment  if  it  is  to  be  removed  efficiently;  and  a  knowledge  of different types is important so that deterioration of surfaces is prevented.

## 4.3.1 Choice of Cleaning Agent

With a variety of cleaning agents in the market, the housekeeper should remember that a  great  deal  of  time,  effort  and  money  can  be  wasted  by  wrong  choice  as  well  as possible deterioration of articles and surfaces. Cleaning agents are chemicals and the housekeeper should have some knowledge of cleaning science if they are to be chosen and  used  correctly.  The  following  points  maybe  taken  into  consideration  when choosing cleaning agents; -

-  Mild  cleaning  agents  are  generally  preferred  for  cleaning  as  they  are  less injurious.
-  Strong chemicals and abrasives may be easy to clean and the surface would look better, but on the long run it may damage the surface.
-  Cleaning  agents  have  to  be  purchased  in  manageable  containers  as  bulk purchases could cause congestion in stores. The containers must have reliable lids, corks as defective ones could result in wastage due to evaporation.
-  Strong  smelling  agents  like  paraffin  must  be  avoided  due  to  the  offensive smells they lend to the environment.
-  Pollutant  free  /  less  polluting  cleaning  agents  should  be  used  to  protect  not only the hotel staff and guests but also people at large.

## Classification of Cleaning Agents

Cleaning  agents  are  classified  according  to  the  principle  method  by  which  soil  or stains are removed from the surface. This will be determined by their composition.

The principle classes are:

- 1. Water
- 2. Detergents
- 3. Abrasives
- 4. Degreasers
- 5. Acid cleaners
- 6. Organic solvents
- 7. Other cleaning agents

Water: Water is the simplest cleaning agent and some form of dirt will be dissolved by it; but normally it is a poor cleaning agent if used alone. It becomes effective only if used in conjunction with some other agent, e.g. a detergent. Water serves to:

-  Carry the cleaning materials to the soil
-  Suspend the soil
-  Remove the suspended soil from the cleaning site

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

-  Rinse the detergent solution from the surface

Water has poor power of detergency because:

-  It has high surface tension and forms droplets
-  It has little wetting power
-  It is repelled by oil and grease
-  If shaken within oil the emulsion does not prevent formation of large droplets
-  It has low surfactant effect (surface active agent) Hardness: Hard water contains calcium and magnesium salts which will inhibit cleaning of material in the following ways -
-  In  combination  with  soap  the  salts  form  insoluble  scum  which  reduces  the efficiency of the soap and makes rinsing difficult
-  Calcium combines with fat in the soil to form a soapy substance which adheres strongly to the surface
-  The  calcium  and  magnesium  salts  tend  to  cause  flocculation  (tendency  to cause soil that is suspended in water, to redeposit on the surface being cleaned)
-  Hardness of water also causes premature aging of fabrics, causes scale and fur to be deposited in machines and pipes.

Hard water can be softened by -

-  Addition of soda
-  Addition of water softener based on sodium sequin - carbonate
-  Water softening units, e.g. permuted.

Detergent: Detergents are those cleaning agents, which contain significant quantities of a group of chemicals known as ‗Surfactants' (chemicals which have water and soil attracting properties). A number of other chemicals are frequently included to produce detergents suitable for a specific use.

A good detergent should -

-  Reduce the surface tension of water so that the cleaning solution can penetrate the soil
-  Emulsify soil and lift it from the surface
-  Be soluble in cold water
-  Be effective in hard water and wide range of temperature.
-  Be  hard  on  surface  that  has  to  be  cleaned.  Clean  quickly  and  with  little agitation.
-  Suspend soil in a cleaning solution, and once the soil is removed, to hold it in suspension and not let it redeposit.
-  Rinse easily and leave no streaks or scum
-  Be economical to user
-  Be harmless to the skin and article.
-  Be bio-degradable

## CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DETERGENT

Surfactants : They are chemicals, whose molecules when dissolved in water possess, water  seeking  end  (hydrophilic)  and  a  water-repelling  end  (hydrophobic).  The molecules  disperse  through  water  and  reduce  the  surface  tension  of  water  by overcoming the forces of attraction between the water molecules, thus allowing the water and surfactant molecule to penetrate the soil and surface.

Builders: They are alkaline chemicals that influence the effectiveness of a cleaning agent in one or both of the following ways -

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

-  They  sequester  (combine  with)  calcium  ions  in  hard  water  to  form  watersoluble salts, thus preventing the adverse effects of calcium.
-  They enhance the emulsifying by increasing the pH value of the solution and dispersing properties of the detergent

Builders  in  general  can  cause  damaging  effect  on  many  surfaces,  e.g.  chrome, aluminum, wool, silk, paint, wood, linoleum. It may constitute up to 30% of heavily built powdered detergents and helps in softening water too.

Foaming agents increase or stabilize the foam formed by a detergent. Foaming can be used to surfactant activity, the level of foam depending on the amount of surfactant active in a cleaning solution, e.g. ethanol amides.

Suspending agents increase the amount of soil that can be held in suspension in the cleaning solution, e.g. sodium carboxymethyl cellulose.

Bleaches will  break  down  with  oxidation,  those  stains  that  have  not  been  removed from the surface by surfactants or builders. Sodium per borate, oxidizing weak bleach is frequently included in detergents intended for washing textiles.

Bulking agents contribute to the volume of detergent powders, e.g. sodium sulphate.

Conditioning agents ensure that the granules in the detergent powder are crisp, firm and dry.

Whiteners cause absolute ultra-violet light to transmit as visible white light.

Enzymes are complex proteins that break down organic substances, e.g. blood stains, food  stains,  etc.  they  are  effective  at  30  to  50  degrees  C  and  are  inactivated  at temperatures above 60 degrees

Anticorrosive agents inhibit  the  formation  of  water  films  on  the  surface.  Chemical reactions resulting in corrosion are generally dependant on the presence of water, e.g. sodium silicate.

Perfumes and dyes are included to increase consumer acceptability, but increase the risk of allergic reactions.

Germicides a re also added sometimes to prevent growth of bacteria and fungus.

Abrasives: The cleaning action of abrasives depend on the presence of fine particles which when rubbed over a soiled hard surface, dislodges the soil, removes tarnishing and surface scratches from meat surfaces. Abrasives can be divided into -

-  Hard surface cleaners
-  Metal polishes.

Abrasives  depend  on  their  rubbing  or  scratching  action  to  clean  dirt  from  hard surfaces. The extent to which they will rub or scratch a surface depends on the nature of the abrasive material and on the size and shape of the particles. The use of abrasive will depend on the surface to be cleaned and the type of dirt to be removed. Whenever possible fine abrasives should preferred to coarser ones. E.g. glass, sand, emery paper, steel  wool,  nylon  pads,  powdered  pumice,  feldspar,  calcite,  fine  ash,  precipitated

whiting,  filtered  chalk,  jeweler's  rouge  (fine  abrasive),  etc.  they  are  available  in natural, liquid, paste or powdered form.

## TYPES OF ABRASIVES

Fine  Abrasives: These  include  precipitated  whiting  (filtered  chalk)  and  jeweler's rouge  (a  pink  oxide  of  iron)  used  for  shining  silver.  They  are  also  constituents  of commercial silver polishes.

Medium abrasives :  these  include  rotten  stone,  salt,  scouring  powder  and  scouring paste.  Scouring  powders  are  made  up  of  fine  particles  of  pumice  mixed  with  soap/ detergent, and alkali and a little bleach.

Hard / coarse abrasives :  these  include  bath  bricks,  sandpaper,  pumice,  steel  wool, and emery paper. Glass paper, calcite, sandpaper, fine ash, emery powder and paper, jeweler's  rouge,  powdered  pumice,  precipitated  whiting  (filtered  chalk).  Ground limestone, sand, steel wool and nylon scourers are some commonly used abrasives. Abrasives are usually not used alone in cleaning agents. For example, a cream or paste meant for cleaning utensils contain about 80 % of finely ground limestone, along with other  substances  such  as  bleaches,  anionic  surfactants,  alkaline  builders,  and

perfumes.

Degreasing  agents: They  usually  consist  of  strong  alkalis,  which  can  dissolve proteins and emulsify and disperse grease and similar substance. They are based on caustic  soda  or  sodium  met  silicate.  Sodium  carbonate  (washing  soda)  can  also  be used.  They  are  basically  used  as  stain  removers  and  for  clearing  blocked  drains, cleaning ovens and other industrial equipment. Extreme care should be taken in their use as they have high pH.

Acids and toilet cleansers: Cleaning agents with acidic properties react with watersoluble chemical deposits to produce water-soluble salts. Acids dissolve metals and are  hence  used  to  remove  metal  stains  such  as  water  stains  in  baths,  hard  water deposits  around  taps,  tarnish  on  silver,  copper  and  brass,  etc. Weak acids include citric  acid (lemon  juice),  acetic  acid  (vinegar).  They  are  used  for  removing  tarnish from copper and brass and mild water stains in baths. Strong acids are oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulphuric acid.

Table 4.1 Acid and their use

| ACID                 | pH                   | USES                                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Concentrated  HCL  1 | Concentrated  HCL  1 | Removing stubborn hard- water deposits.                     |
| Dilute HCL  1        | Dilute HCL  1        |                                                             |
| Oxalic               | Oxalic               | 2  removing stubborn hard- water deposits                   |

| Sodium  sulphate     |                      | Removing  hard-water  deposits  and  scales  from  toilets. |
|                      | and  5               |                                                             |

Acids can cause further staining on metals if it is not washed off quickly, and may spoil the glaze on sanitary fitments. Toilet cleansers rely on their acid content to clean and  keep  the  W/C  pan  hygienic  and  remove  metal  stains.  They  can  be  crystalline, powdered  or  liquid. Powdered  toilet cleanser  consists  of  a  soluble  acidic  powder, chlorinated  bleach,  finely  ground  abrasive  (to  help  when  a  brush  is  used)  and  an effervescing  substance,  which  helps  to  spread  the  active  ingredient  throughout  the water. Liquid toilet cleansers are a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, and should be used with great care, because the concentration may cause damage to the surface of the pan, it's surrounding areas, and to the person using it (if the liquid is spilt).

Alkalis: These are used as cleaning agents in the form of liquids and powders. They are particularly useful in the laundry. Very strong alkalis should be used with utmost caution as they are corrosive and toxic. These are called caustic alkalis. Many alkalis act as bleaches. Caustic soda- based cleaning agents are used to clear blocked drains and to clean ovens and other industrial equipment.

Table 4.2 Alkalis and their use

| ALKALIS                           |   pH | USES                                                                                                                   |

Organic solvents: These are chemicals that dissolve fat, oil, grease, wax or similar compounds  from  different  surface,  e.g.  methylated  spirit,  white  spirit  (turpentine substitute), carbon tetrachloride. The former two are highly inflammable while carbon tetrachloride is harmful if inhaled, and hence should never be used in a closed area. Many are used for routine stain removal. They are harmful to skin and some surfaces and are fire hazardous.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Polishes: They do not necessarily clean but produce a shine by providing a smooth surface  from  which  light  is  reflected  evenly.  They  do  this  by  smoothing  out  any unevenness on the surface of the article, in many cases by forming a thin layer of wax on the surface, thus giving some protection.

Metal polishes :  These remove the tarnish resulting from the attack on the metal by certain  compounds  and  some  foodstuffs.  They  are  of  two  basic  types,  one  for  hard metal  and  other  for  soft.  Either  type  maybe  liquid  or  paste.  Liquid  polish  is  a  fine abrasive waxed with grease solvent, and sometimes with an acid, e.g. plate powder, precipitated  whiting,  jeweler's  rouge,  mentholated  spirit,  and  ammonia.  Abrasive when rubbed on the surface of the metal provides friction to remove the tarnish and produce a shine.

## Floor polishes -They are of two basic types

-  Spirit based and
-  Water based.

Spirit based polishes contain a blend of mainly natural waxes, dispersed in a spirit solvent.  They  may  be  in  paste  or  liquid  form  and  contains  silicon,  but  too  high  a silicon  content  makes  the  floor  slippery.  The  buildup  of  polish  can  be  removed  by loosing the wax finish with spirit and slight abrasion, and then picking up the loosened wax with a damp cloth mop. It is suitable for flooring those are harmed by water like wood, cork, linoleum, and magnesite.

Water-based polished are emulsions in which fine particles of natural and synthetic waxes are dispersed in water. They are suitable for use on thermoplastic, rubber, PVC, asphalt and combination floors as spirits can affect them. They can also be used on sealed  flooring  of  wood,  cork,  magnesite  and  linoleum.  Water-based  polishes  are always liquid but maybe fully buff able, semi-buff able or dry bright. The build-up polish can be removed by loosening the wax synthetic resin with hot water and alkali -  no  detergent.  Floor  polishes  are  floor  waxes  and  have  to  be  subjected  to  rough traffic. A more lasting surface can be obtained by use of a floor seal, with or without water based polish applied on it. Seals are semi-permanent materials, which renders the floor impermeable and protects it from dirt, stains and other foreign matter. They are not polishes.

Furniture polishes are intended for wooden furniture and fittings. They are protective finishes, which provide the surface of the furniture with a thin layer of wax or resin. This  layer  gives  protection  against  abrasion,  absorption  of  spillages  and  a  smooth surface from which light maybe reflected to give a shine or sheen. It consists of waxes dissolved in varying amount of spirits. They are of four types -

- i. Paste wax polish - high proportion of wax plus silicon
- ii. Cream polish - greater amounts of spirit to give a cleaning action.
- iii. Liquid polish - have great proportion of spirit requiring no buffing.
- iv. Spray polish - also has high proportion of spirit.

Floor sealers: These are applied to flooring surfaces as a semi- permanent finish that acts  as  a  protective  barrier  by  preventing  the  entry  of  dirt,  gems  and  liquid,  grease, stains  and  bacteria.  They  prevent  scratching  and  provide  an  easily  maintainable surface.  The  right  type  of  seal  should  be  applied  to  each  type  of  floor  for  effective

protection and an attractive appearance. According to their functions, floor sealers can be finishing protective or combination of both.

## Types of floor sealers

- 1. Oleo-resinous sealers : they are used for imparting an attractive surface gloss penetrating the floor darkening the color and highlighting the grain of wood floors.
- 2. One-pot plastic sealers: they are used on wood, wood- composition, cork and magnesite floors.
- 3. Two-pot  plastic  sealers: they  are  also  used  on  wood,  wood-  composition, cork and magnetite floors.
- 4. Pigmented sealers: these may be used on concrete, wood, wood-composition, magnesite, asphalt, and stone floors.
- 5. water-based seals : these may used on marble , terrazzo, magnesite, linoleum, rubber, thermoplastic tiles, PVCs, asphalt, concrete, stone-, and quarry tiles.

Bleaches: Bleaches  used  for  cleaning  purposes  are  generally  alkaline  stabilized solutions of sodium hypochlorite and are useful for stained sinks, W/C pans, etc, but they must never be mixed with other types of toilet cleansers. They whiten and have germicidal  properties.  Great  care  should  be  taken  to  prevent  spotting  on  other surfaces.

Dis-infectants  and  de-odorants: Disinfectants,  antiseptics  and  de-odorants  are  not strictly cleaning  agents,  but  are  often  used  during  the  cleaning  operations. Disinfectants  kill  bacteria;  antiseptics  prevent  bacterial  growth  and  are  frequently diluted  disinfectants.  Use  of  disinfectants  should  not  be  necessary  if  the  cleaning methods are correct.

## TYPES OF DISINFECTANTS

Disinfectants can be categorized in terms of their chemical action and compositions

Phenols: these are hydroxyl derivatives of the aromatic hydrocarbon benzene. They are used in dilute or high concentrations to disinfect surfaces in hospitals especially .in hotels, diluted phenols are used with their sharp smell masked by other additives.

Halogens: the elements chlorine and iodine may be used as disinfectants .Chlorine is used both as bleach and as a disinfectant on many surfaces .Iodine is not often used to disinfectant surfaces because it tends to leave brown stains.

Quaternary  ammonium  compounds : these  are  cationic  surfactants  useful  as bactericides.

Natural pine oils: pine oils are obtained from pine trees. They are germicidal to some extent, but are mainly added changing formulation for their pleasant smell.

Deodorants mask unpleasant smells by either combining chemically with the particle causing smell, or by their smell being pre-dominant. This is not required where there is good ventilation and thorough cleaning.

They  are  used  in  restrooms,  guestrooms,  guest  bathrooms,  cloakrooms  and  public areas such as lobbies. Some deodorizers leave no trace of a perfume cover- up. They are usually available as aerosol sprays, Liquids, powders and crystalline blocks.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Window  or  glass  cleansers Window  cleansers  consist  of  water-miscible  solvents, often isopropyl alcohol, to which small quantities of surfactants and possibly an alkali are  added  to  improve  the  polishing  effect  of  the  cleanser.  Some  also  contain  fine abrasives.  Most  glass  cleaners  are  available  as  sprays  or  liquid.  They  are  sprayed directly onto windows, mirrors and other glass surfaces or applied on with a soft cloth and rubbed off using a soft, lint- free glass cloth. An inexpensive glass cleaner that can  be  readily  made  in  the  housekeeping  department  is  soft  water  to  which  some vinegar is added can be used with old newspaper.

## ABSORBENTS

They carry out the action by absorbing the stain or grease. They are used only when the quantity of stain is too much. E.g. starch powder, fuller's earth, bran, French chalk powder, etc.

## 4.3.3 Storage of Cleaning Agents

Cleaning  agents  with  a  longer  shelf  life  are  usually  bought  in  bulk  because  of  the reduced costs that accrue from the economics of scale. other agents are bought and replenished periodically .storage of cleaning agents is crucial and the various points to be kept in mind .the points are listed below:

- 1. Ensure that  the  storage  racks  are  strong  and  with  selves.  Heavier  containers must be kept on the bottom shelf.
- 2. The store should be kept clean and well-ventilated at all times.
- 3. Ensure that the lids are tightly fitted.
- 4. When  issuing  cleaning  agents  use  appropriate  dispensers  and  measuring apparatus.
- 5. Ensure that no residual deposits of cleaning agent are left around the rims of the containers.
- 6. Avoid spillage, if a spill occurs, clean it up immediately.
- 7. Follow a systematic procedure for rotating stocks.
- 8. Organic  solvents,  strong  reagents,  polishes  should  be  kept  away  from  heat sources.
- 9. Check stock regularly .the store should be locked when not in use.

## 4.4 Cleaning Equipments

To keep the hotel clean and hygienic, various equipments and supplies are used. No work  can  be  done  without  proper  equipment.  It  is  important  that  the  housekeeper makes a careful selection of equipment based on necessity and suitability for use in a hotel  industry,  appropriate  design  and  required  size,  rugged  construction  and  finish, ease and availability of maintenance, low initial and operating costs, on-the-job tested performance,  safety,  are  consumables,  and  equipment  is  reusable.  Thus,  floor machines,  brooms,  mops,  vacuum  machines,  etc,  are  categorized  as  equipment, whereas  cleaning  agents  are  supplies.  There  are  mainly  two  types  of  cleaning equipments, viz.

- a. Manual cleaning equipments and
- b. Mechanical cleaning equipments.

## 4.4.1 Manual Equipment

Manual equipment can include all types of equipment that clean or aid in the cleaning process by directly using manoeuvre, operation and energy of employees.

## BRUSHES

These may be designed to remove dry or wet and ingrained dust and dirt from hard or soft surfaces.

Basic parts of a brush : The basic parts of a brush are as follows . They are:

-  Bristles
-  Head Stock
-  Handle

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Bristles : These may be of animal, vegetable or manmade origin. Horsehair, nylon and polypropylene are commonly used to make bristles for cleaning brushes. In general, the finer, softer bristles are best for smooth and hard surfaces. The harder the bristles, the  softer  the  surface  on  which  the  brush  should  be  used,  exception  being  toilet brushes and brushes found on all-purpose flour machines. Bristles, if not maintained properly, have a tendency to bend, splay or fall out of  the stock. Bristles should be closely set in tufts and the stock well covered with tufts.

Head stock: This  is  the  part  of  the  brush  into  which  the  bristles  are  inserted.  The stock may be of wood, metal, or plastic. A good brush is one that has a sturdy stock.

Handle: Brush  handles  may  be  detachable  or  non-detachable.  Detachable  handles must be fixed firmly in place on the stock when the brush is in use.

Types of brushes : Three main types of brushes are used for cleaning surfaces. Hard brushes: Hard  brushes  have  bristles  that  are  fairly  stiff  and  well  spaced  out. They are most suitable for the removal of heavy soil and litter from carpets and for cleaning rough surfaces.

Soft brushes: Soft brushes have bristles that are fairly flexible and set close together. These help to remove loose soil and litter on hard, smooth surfaces. Such brushes may be designed to dust carpets and furniture, too, especially those made of cane, wicker and bamboo.

Scrubbing brushes: Scrubbing brushes have short, coarse bristles designed for use on surfaces  that  have  become  stained  and  heavily  ingrained  with  dirt.  These  brushes should  only  be  used  to  remove  stubborn,  heavy  soiling  from  small  areas  that  are difficult  for  a  scrubbing  machine to  access.  Long handled scrubbing brushes, called deck scrubbers or T-scrubbers, are useful for cleaning larger areas as well as corners.

## Brushes are also classified on basis of their function:

Toilet brushes: These are WC brushes, radiator brushes and Johnny mops.

Bottle brushes: These are used for cleaning overflow vents in wash basins and tubs.

Cloth scrubbers: These are used for scrubbing clothes.

Deck scrubbers: These are used for cleaning large areas.

Carpet brushes: These are used for brushing carpets.

Upholstery brushes: These are used to loosen out dust embedded between the fabric fibres in upholstered chairs and sofas

Feather brushes: These are brushes with feathers, for light dusting.

Care and cleaning of brushes: Brushes should be gently tapped on a hard surface to loosen  dust  and  debris  after  the  cleaning  process.  Frequent  wash  with  water  is avoidable since the brushes may lose some of their stiffness in this way. If they must be washed frequently, the final rinse should be in cold saline water to help the bristles regain  their  stiffness.  Brushes  should  be  cleaned  of  all  fluff  and  threads  before washing. They may then be rinsed in warm, mild soapy water. A disinfectant should be added to the water used for rinsing toilet brushes. . The best way would be to hang the brushes bristles downward. When possible, dry brushes in the sun or open air. To extend the life of the brush, apply lacquer to the stock and handle with an oil-can and allow to harden.

## BROOMS

Sweeping brooms consist of long bristles gathered together and inserted into a handle. The bristles of a broom may be made of grass, corn or coconut fibres. Depending on the type, brooms may be used for removing dust or dirt in large areas.

Types of brooms: As with brushes, brooms may be classified into 3 main categories:

Soft-bristled brooms: Soft bristled brooms such as corn-fibre brooms, grass brooms and whisk brooms are used on smooth floors. A good soft broom has comparatively fewer split ends and any splits that do form are short.

Hard/Coarse-bristled  brooms: Brooms  such  as  yard  brooms  and  coconut  fibre brooms are used on course surfaces, especially outdoors.

Wall brooms: These are also called ceiling brooms or Turk's heads. They have a soft head  and  long  handle,  usually  made  of  cane.  These  brooms  are  used  to  remove cobwebs as well as dust from cornices, ceilings and high ledges.

Care and cleaning of brooms: Brooms should be shaken free of dust and fluff. Never store them standing on their bristles, or the bristles will bend out of shape, resulting in inefficient  cleaning.  Store  brooms  either  lying  horizontally  or  hanging  bristles downward. Never use soft brooms on wet surfaces. Stiff brooms such as coconut-fibre brooms  can  be  used  on  wet  surfaces  but  must  be  cleaned  afterward  thoroughly  in saline water and dried in the sun before cleaning.

Box Sweepers: These are also called carpet sweepers and are used for sweeping up

dust  and  litter  from  soft  floor  coverings  as  well  as rugs  and  carpets.  They  are  ideal  for  the  removal  of spills and for light cleaning of small carpeted areas. A box sweeper consists of a friction brush that revolves

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

when the equipment is pushed manually over the carpet bottom to facilitate emptying after use. Choose sweepers with a wide base that is low enough to be pushed under furniture and that will clean close to a wall. In sweepers meant to clean hard floors as well as soft floor coverings, the brush can be lowered to the floor to sweep.

Care and cleaning of box sweepers : The friction brush should be kept clean; else the efficiency of the equipment will be seriously impaired. After the cleaning process, the dustpans should be emptied of all the collected dust.

## MOPS

Basically they are of two types

- a. Dry Mops
- b. Wet/damp mops:

Dry Mops: Also called dust control mops, these are designed to remove  soil  and  debris  from  floors,  walls  and  ceilings  without raising  and  dissipating  dust.  These  mops  generally  consist  of  a

<!-- image -->

handle to which a metal frame is attached. The mop head is either inserted into the frame or stretched over it, according to the type.

Types of dry mops: There are 4 principle types of dry mops.

Mops  with  impregnated  fringes: These  mops  consist  of  dense  cotton  fringes, approximately  15  cm  in  length,  inserted  into  a  metal  frame  of  15-120  cm  length. These mops are usually pre-impregnated or will require impregnation by soaking in or spraying with mineral oil or a synthetic impregnating fluid. The dust is held onto the mops by the oil.

Impregnated mop sweepers: These mops consist of a double-hinged frame and are thus  called  ‗V-sweepers'  of  ‗scissor-action  sweepers'.  The  mops  can  be  preimpregnated or may require impregnation before each use. Following impregnation, sufficient time must be allowed for the mineral oil to cure the fibres; else the mop will leave a film of oil on the cleaned surface due to improper curing. To be effective, an impregnated mop must also be manoeuvred correctly.  It should be worked in long, even  strokes  in  a  continual  movement,  keeping  the  mop  head  in  contact  with  the surface  all  the  time.  This  way,  maximum  dust  collection  and  minimum  dust dissipation is ensured.

Static  mops: These  mops  consist  of  acrylic,  nylon  or  polyester  strands  fixed  to  a backing stretched over a metal frame. When in use, the fringes splay out to form a large  surface  area,  holding  dust  by  means  of  a  static  charge  that  builds  up  on  the fringe. Static mops are more easily maintained than impregnated mops.

Disposable mops: These  mops consist  of  a  handle  with  a  soft  pad  at  the  end,  onto which  a  cheap  cotton  or  synthetic  material  is  affixed.  The  material  has  properties enabling it to attract and hold dust. The fabric is held in place by clips or a special tape and is usually

Care and cleaning of dry mops: Shake mops well after use outdoors. The mop head should  be  easily  detachable  so  they  can  be  frequently  washed  in  hot  water  with detergent. The use of soap-free detergent will prevent the formation of scum that clogs the fibres of the head. The mop must be worked up and down in at least 2 changes of clean, hot water. The clean mop should then be tightly squeezed out, shaken well to get rid of excess moisture and left to dry in open air. Once dry, the mops may need to be re-impregnated.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Wet/damp mops: These mops are used in conjunction with buckets for the removal  of dirt adhering to a surface. The mop heads can be made of cotton, sponge or any other fibre capable of absorbing moisture well.

Types  of  damp  mops: There  are  4  types  of  damp  mops available:

<!-- image -->

Do-all mops: These mops consist of strands of twisted cotton fixed to a circular metal plate, which in turn is fixed to a stock.

Kentucky  mops: These  mops  consist  of  cotton  strands  fixed  to  a  length  of  cotton fabric which is in turn inserted into a flat metal stock. They are available in weights ranging from 330g to 670g. The strands may be stitched together or unstitched. The former are less likely to tangle, can be laundered more easily and

are likely to last longer than unstitched mops.

Foss  mops: These  consist  of  a  dense  cotton  fringe  inserted into a heavy metal stock. They are available in a wide range of weights.

Sponge  mops: These  consist  of  cellulose  sponge  fixed  to  a replaceable,  lever-controlled  head,  hinged  for  wringing  out and attached to a long handle. Using a sponge mop is one of

<!-- image -->

the easiest ways to wash a hard floor. Short handled sponge mops are also available for cleaning windows.

Squeegee: A  squeegee  consists  of  a  long  metallic  handle  and  a  wooden  or  rubber blade  to  remove  excess  water  from  a  surface  being  cleaned  It  is  effective  when followed  by  mopping  with  a  damp  mop.  A  smaller  version  called  the  window squeegee is used for wiping away water from windows after washing.

Care and cleaning of damp mops: Take mops outdoors after use and shake well to remove excess  moisture.  Then  these  mops  may  be  washed  in  the  same  way  as  dry mops. Detachable heads are easier to clean and maintain. However, drying is the most important part of mop care as bacteria require moisture to multiply. A disinfectant to discourage their growth is effective only for a short period of time, so leaving them damp means letting germs breed. Damp mops should be renewed as soon as there are signs  of  wear.  They  should  be  stored  in  such  a  way  that  air  is  allowed  to  circulate around the mop head. Never use disinfectant or bleach with a cellulose sponge head. Wash and rinse sponge heads after use, squeeze out excess water and dry well. Store the sponge head by hanging.

## CLOTHS

Various cloths are used extensively in wet and dry cleaning by housekeeping staff. For efficient and correct usage, cloths may be colour-coded and the staff well-trained.

Types of cloths: A variety of cloths are available for specific purposes.

Dusters and cloth mittens: These are meant for dusting and buffing. Soft, absorbent plain or checked cotton material or yellow flannelette of up to 15 sq. Cm is ideal for

Leather

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

dusters. When used for damp dusting, they must be sprayed with a fine mist of water or  dusting  solution.  Cloths  may  be  impregnated  with  a  mineral  oil  instead.  Dusters must  be  folded  several  times  into  a  hand-sized  pad  before  use  so  as  to  provide  a number of clean surfaces and avoid spreading dirt again to a clean surface instead.

Swabs  and  wipes: These  are  all-purpose  cloths  made  of  soft,  absorbent  material. They are used for wet cleaning and damp dusting of all surfaces above floor level. They are  also  used  for  cleaning  sanitary  fittings  such  as  bathtubs  and  wash  basins. Wipes include loosely woven or knitted cotton cloths and non-woven cloths. Synthetic sponges may also be grouped under this category. They are available in various sizes and shapes. Sponges are better than cloths for washing walls, woodwork, glass and upholstery.

Floor cloths: Floor cloths are bigger, thicker and made of coarser cotton material than all-purpose swabs. They are used to wipe WC pedestals and remove spills from floors.

Scrim: This  is  a  loosely  woven  linen  material  resembling  fine  sackcloth.  Scrim, because of its high absorbency and lint-free nature, is often used instead of chamois leather for cleaning windows and mirrors.

Glass cloths: Glass  cloths  are  made  up  of  linen  tow  yarns  and  do  not  leave  behind lint. They can therefore be used for wiping mirrors and drinking glasses. These must not be confused with fabrics made from glass fibres (glasscloth).

Rags  and  polishing  cloths: Rags  are  disposable  cloths  usually  obtained  from  the sewing room or bought by the sack from tailors. They are used for applying polish or strong cleaning agents are disposed off when dirty. Polishing cloths need to have a fleecy napped surface and pieces of flannel are ideal.

Wet cloths: Wet cloths need to be very absorbent and of a manageable size, so that they  can  be  wrung  out  by  hand  easily  during  cleaning.  They  are  used  for  mopping large floor areas.

Chamois leather: Real chamois leather is the skin of the chamois goat antelope, but now various  cheaper imitations  are  available.  These  simulated  chamois  leathers  are usually skivers, that is, split sheepskin. Chamois leather can be used wet for cleaning windows and mirrors; when dry; it is used as a polishing cloth for silver and other metals. It is also ideal for wiping squeegee blades.

Dust sheets: Dust sheets are made of any thin cotton material, being about the size of a single sheet. Discarded bed sheets or curtains from the linen room are ideal for use as dust sheets. They are used to cover floors, furniture or other articles during spring cleaning or decorating.

Druggets: These are made up of coarse linen, fine canvas or clear plastic. They may be the size of a carpet square or runner. They are placed on the floor in doorways to prevent  excessive  dirt  being  tracked  in  or  out  during  bad  weather  and  during redecorating projects. They are sometimes placed in the passage between the kitchen and dining area to catch spills and debris.

Hearth and bucket cloths: These are made up of thick fabrics and used to protect the carpet  and  flooring  when  a  fireplace  is  being  cleaned  or  placed  under  buckets  to prevent marks on the surface they are kept on. They also catch splashes of water. Care and cleaning of cloths: Good care of cloths is important for efficient cleaning and longer life. Care and cleaning recommendations for various types of cloths are given in Table 7.1.

| Rags  and  polishing  cloths | Rags  should  be  disposed  off  after  use.  Polishes  with  a  strong odour may contain flammable chemicals and storing  rags  and  polishing  cloths  used  in  their  application  may  prove a fire hazard.                                                         |
| Wet cloths                   | Wash  in  hot  detergent  water,  rinse  and  dry  thoroughly.  Disinfect  periodically  to  prevent  them  from  becoming  unhygienic.                                                                                                                                  |

CONTAINERS: Work  becomes  much  easier  and  efficient  if  the  staff  is  given appropriate containers in which to carry, transport, collect and store supplies and other items.

Buckets: These may be made of plastic or galvanised iron. Plastic buckets are more popular  these  days  as  they  are  lighter  in  weight,  quieter  to  use  and  easier  to  clean. Buckets to be used with mops may have one or two sections and may have a wringer device that can be detached for easy cleaning.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Basins and bowls: These are used to carry small amounts of water, cleaning solutions and powders for cleaning small areas.

Dustpans: These are used in conjunction with a broom or brush for gathering dust. They may be made of plastic or metal, plastic ones being the usual choice these days. Dustpans with long handles that eliminate stooping are ideal.

Dustbins: These bins may be made of plastic or wood. Some properties also use jute or wicker bins. Individual dustbins in guestrooms may be lined with a disposable inner lining made of recycled paper or plastic. These bins must be emptied and wiped daily. They should be washed once a week.

Sani-bins: These are metal or plastic bins with lids. They are found in toilets for the collection of soiled sanitary towels. They should be lined with plastic or paper bags for easy cleaning. The bins must be emptied and wiped daily for reasons of hygiene.

Spray bottles: These  are  lightweight  containers  that  deliver  a  fine  mist  or  cleaning solution through a fine nozzle, particularly used for spray cleaning. It is essential that the nozzle is properly adjusted and free from any blockage. The nozzle must be kept clean,  by  spraying  clean,  pure  water  through  it  after  every use.

Polish applicator trays: These are used in conjunction with a polish  applicator  mop  for  polishing  floors  with  a  liquid polish.  They  should  be  labelled  with  the  kind  of  polish  that they  hold.  Cleaning  them  after  use  is  difficult.  Pour  any excess polish back into the polish container. Soak the tray in a

<!-- image -->

small amount of solvent used to remove that particular type of polish. Wipe with rags and store.

Hand  caddies: Also  called ‗cleaners' boxes', these were originally made of wood or metal but are nowadays usually made of plastic. They consist of a box with a handle and  fitted  tray.  They  are  used  by  room

<!-- image -->

attendants for carrying cleaning supplies from room to room for guestroom cleaning. After each shift, they must be cleaned and topped up with replacement supplies for use in the next shift.

Carts and trolleys: These are more useful than hand caddies when a large amount of supplies and items are to be carted or replaced. They are ideal for the efficient removal and  carriage  of  smaller  pieces  of  cleaning  equipment,  cleaning  agents,  linen  and rubbish. They eliminate the time wasted in assembling equipment at the work location or moving them from one place to another. The various kinds of carts and trolleys that may be used in the housekeeping department are discussed here.

Maid's cart/Room attendant's cart: Also called a attendant's  trolley,  maid's  cart  or  chambermaid's trolley, this is perhaps the most significant piece of

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

equipment in the housekeeping department. It is like a giant tool  box; stocked with everything necessary to service a guestroom effectively such carts available are now made  of  metal,  but  sometimes  wooden  carts  may  be  in  use.  The  cart  should  be spacious enough to carry all the supplies needed for a GRA to complete half a day's room assignments. Since the cart is large and may be heavily loaded, it must be easily manoeuvrable as well. The ideal cart would have fixed wheels at one end and castorwheels at the other. The cart should be well organised so that the GRAs do not have to waste time in searching for supplies or make frequent trips back to the supply room. Also if the cart is not stacked neatly, it will look very unsightly when in the guests' view. There is usually one such cart for each room section and it is stored in the floor pantry along with other housekeeping supplies.

Janitor's  trolley: This  is  used  for  carting  and  storing  cleaning  supplies.  It  is  used during  the  cleaning  of  public  areas  or  any  special  cleaning  projects  scheduled  for guestrooms. It includes a detachable trash bag and a place for storing cleaning agents and small pieces of cleaning equipment.

Mop-wringer trolley: This  piece  of  equipment  consists  of  a  mop  and  one  or  twin buckets with an attached wringer, all mounted on a trolley with caster wheels. It may have provision for holding cleaning agents as well as a trash bag.

Linen trolley: These are used for the transfer of clean linen from the laundry to the linen room or from the linen room to the floor pantries and so on. Linen trolleys may be made of aluminium or steel.

Laundry  sacks: These,  in  fact,  may  or  may  not  be  mobile  (and  hence  may  not necessarily  be  trolleys).  They  may  be  made  of  wicker,  fibreglass  or  plastic.  A  very popular choice is the one made of tough cotton with drawstrings, as it can be washed frequently.

Cleaning and care of trolleys: All  carts  and  trolleys  need  to  be  kept  clean,  wiped daily  and  stored  in  a  locked,  dry,  well-ventilated  area  when  not  in  use.  A  thorough cleaning may be done once a week. The wheels may be oiled during this cleaning. Carts or trolleys should never become general dumping grounds when not in use.

## 4.4.2 Mechanical Equipment

The various pieces of mechanical equipment used in the housekeeping department are usually powered by electricity or gas. The staff should be well-trained in the operation of these equipments since incorrect usage will not only lead to inefficient cleaning but may also become a safety hazard.

Vacuum cleaners/ Suction cleaners: Vacuum cleaners remove debris and soil and/or water  from  a  surface  by  suction.  All  vacuum  cleaners  work  on  the  same  operating principle. In all types, motor drives an impeller, which sucks in air through an inlet, creating a difference in pressure between the air within and outside the machine. Air drawn in from the inlet passes through and out of the machine. Air drawn in from the inlet passes through and out of the machine. Usually the air is sucked in together with soil,  debris  or  water.  The  dust  is  collected  into  a  container  provided,  which  may  be within  the  body  of  the  machine  (as  in  cylindrical  and  canister  models)  or  on  the outside in the form of a bag (as in upright models). The dust-collecting apparatus in the heavy duty models used in hotel properties usually consists of 2 types of dust bags. The inner bag is made of disposable paper and the outer one is made of fabric.

Types of vacuum cleaners: Various types of vacuum cleaners are available.

Dry vacuum cleaners :  These are used for removing dust and small pieces of debris from floors, upholstery, furnishings, walls and ceilings. Those using a flexible hose come  with  attachments,  such  as  a  floor-cleaning  head,  a  power  head,  a  crevicecleaning head, an upholstery-cleaning head, a dusting head and extension tubes.Many variations of the dry vacuum cleaner are in use:

Electric brooms: These are very lightweight vacuums without a motor-driven beater brush. They are used only for light vacuuming and for touch-ups on carpets and hard floors. In other words, they come in handy when a full vacuuming is required.

Dustettes: These are small, lightweight vacuum cleaners used for cleaning curtains, upholstery edges, mattresses, computers and music systems. They clean by brushing and suction and are very easy to handle. The may be carried in hand or strapped to the back of the operator.

Backpack vacuums: These are very efficient to clean high, hard-to-reach areas. The vacuum  unit  in  these  machines  can  easily  be  strapped  to  the  back  of  the  operator. These  machines  have  hand-held  wands  that  come  with  various  attachments  for flexibility in cleaning. They are ideal for use on curtains, drapes and ceiling corners. These vacuums are also referred to as piggyback vacuums.

Upright vacuums: These vacuums are the ones more frequently seen in hotels. The main body of the vacuum lies horizontal on the floor and is driven by a single motor. The dust-bag is outside the machine's main body. There is a belt-driven beater brush to facilitate removal of dust from thick-pile carpets. In an improved variation, there is a dual-motor system - one motor drives the beater brush and the other provides the suction. The machine also has a built-in hose for cleaning corners and upholstery. This machine is most suitable for use on large carpeted areas.

Cylindrical vacuums: These have no rotating brushes and work by suction only. The term ‗suction cleaner' is generally used for these kinds of vacuum cleaners. A filtercum-diffuser is fitted at the outlet which removes fine dust and micro-organisms from the  flow  of  air  passing  through  the  outlet.  The  filter-cum-diffuser  also  reduces  air disturbance  and  noise.  The  dust-bag  is  inside  the  cylindrical  body  of  the  vacuum cleaner. A flexible hose along with the different attachments is used to clean a variety of surfaces. These are the type commonly used by GRAs in guestroom cleaning.

Pile-lifter  vacuums: These  vacuum  cleaners  are  used  to  groom  long-pile  carpets. They lift  up  the  carpet  pile  that  has  become  packed  down  and  restore  their  vertical orientation. It is especially useful before shampooing the carpet, more so if the soiling is heavy.

Fig4.4 different types of vacuum cleaners

Centralized  vacuum: In  this  type  of  unit,  suction  is  generated  at  one  point  in  the building. Meanwhile, soiling can be removed at vacuum points somewhere else in the building by suitable nozzles connected to detachable flexible hoses. The collected dirt is then conveyed by a network of pipes to a central container. This unit is expensive to install and is generally done at the building construction stage. The advantages of this kind of system are :

-  It  is  extremely  hygienic,  since  all  the  dust  is  carried  away  from  the  point  of cleaning.
-  Maintenance costs are usually lower.
-  Operative fatigue is lower.
-  There are no frayed flexes to repair and no individual machines to go wrong.

Wet-and-dry vacuum  cleaners :  These  are  extremely  useful  in  hotel  housekeeping operations.  They  can  pick  up  spills  and  excess  wash  water  when  on  the  wet  mode. When  on  the  dry  mode,  they  help  in  removal  of  dust  and  debris.  In  hotels,  these machines are usually used in their wet mode to pick up spills. They are also required when  large  areas  of  floors  are  being  stripped  of  polish  and  cleaned.  They  have  a flexible hose with attachments such as a squeegee head. The waste water collects in a tank  that  needs  to  be  emptied  after  use.  A  variation  of  this  is  the  large  tank-type vacuum cleaners.  These  are  also  called  canister-type  or  industrial  vacuum  cleaners. They can be used for dry and wet pick-up or both. The waste water is scooped up by a squeegee attachment through a nozzle and travels back into the tank. They are used for cleaning large areas when time is a constraint. They are ideal for cleaning lobbies, banquet halls and restaurants.

Care and storage: Vacuum cleaners will  give  maximum  cleaning  efficiency  when they  are  maintained  well.  Housekeeping  staff  need  to  be  trained  in  the  care  and maintenance  of  the  machines.  The  wheels  of  the  machine  need  to  be  oiled periodically. After use, the dust bags should be checked and emptied. If the machine is operated with the dust bags full, cleaning will not be operated, the machine may heat up too much and the bags may get damaged. Wipe the casing daily and check the hose and flex before use. Clean the attachment heads after each use. Check the filter after

use.  If  the  machine  is  meant  for  dry suction only, never use it to clear even a little amount of water, else the dust bags will  get  damaged.  In  case  of  wet vacuums, the bucket should be washed, rinsed  and  dried.  The  squeegee  should be  wiped  clean  and  replaced  whenever necessary. The hose needs to be rinsed out,  the  casing  and  wheels  wiped  and the filter checked after use. The wheels need  oiling  periodically.  The  hoses should be stored hanging on hooks. The tubes  and  attachment  heads  of  a  dry vacuum  cleaner  should  be  stored  in

<!-- image -->

boxes, drawers of shelves. The hoses and attachment heads of wet vacuum cleaners should be stored off the ground on a rack, in a well-ventilated place

## General-purpose floor machines (scrubbing and polishing machines)

These  are  designed  for  scrubbing,  buffing,  burnishing,  scarifying  and  spray maintenance.

Scrubbing: The  bristle  tips  of  a  brush  or  the  surface  of  a  pad  abrade  and  cut  the soiling to remove it.

Buffing: The bristle tips of a brush or the surface of a pad create a high-gloss finish on the floor surface. In case of a surface on which a polish has been applied, it will involve generation of a local heat to harden waxes and resins.

Burnishing: The  tips  of  a  brush  or  the  surface  of  a  pad  abrade  and  cut  the  floor surface to create a smooth surface with a glossy finish. In case of a polished surface, it will involve the removal of a surface layer of polish.

Scarifying: The  bristle  tips  or  edge  of  a  cutting  tool,  cut  into  impacted  soiling  and remove it by means of a chisel-like action.

Spray  cleaning  : This  is  similar  to  spray  cleaning,  but  the  term  is  applied  to  the maintenance of floors where a buffable or semi-buffable polish has been applied and the bristle tips of a brush or the surface of a pad remove both soiling and the surface layer of polish to leave a smooth, glossy surface. Resins and waxes in the maintenance product  form  part  of  the  restored  finish.  These  machines  consist  of  one  large  or several  small  brushes  that  revolve  and  scrub  the  floor.  Water  and  detergent  are released  from  a  tank  attached  to  the  machine.  These  machines  can  be  used  for shampooing  carpets,  polishing  floors  and  spray  maintenance.  Such  general-purpose machines are preferred in many establishments as the machine can be put to greater use due to its versatility. In some machines, coloured, abrasive nylon pads replace the scrubbing brushes. For normal-speed machines:

Care and storage of general-purpose machines: The brushes and pads should never be left on the machine after cleaning. The brushes should be detached after cleaning. The fluff should be removed from them after washing. Wash, rinse and dry wet ones after  use.  The  dry  ones  should  be  washed  occasionally,  but  dust  should  be  tapped away after  use  regularly.  The  pads  should  be  washed,  rinsed  and  dried  thoroughly. The  tanks  should  be  emptied,  washed  and  dried.  The  wheels  and  casing  should  be wiped after use. The wheels need oiling periodically. The flex should be checked for

any  fraying  before  each  use.  Brushes  and pads  should  be  stored  in  a  well-ventilated area,  preferably  on  airing  racks  or  hooks. They should not be kept flat on the ground. The  tops  of  the  tanks  may  be  loosely  fitted during storage.

## Wet-extraction systems:

These  machines  are  used  to  restore  the surface appearance of carpets, upholstery and

<!-- image -->

curtains.  They  remove  the  more  deeply  embedded  soilage  not  easily  removed  by suction cleaning. They are also useful in the application of soil-retardant finishes on carpets.

Types of wet-extraction systems: There are various types of wet-extraction systems.

Hot-water  extraction  machines: These  are  machines  with  no  rotary  action.  They carry a tank for hot water and detergent, which are used for deep cleaning carpets. The hot water and detergent are shot into the carpet from high-pressure spray nozzles. The dirt is thus flushed to the surface and this, along with the soiled water is removed by suction into a container in the machine.

Solvent  extraction  machines: These  machines  are  primarily  used  for  cleaning upholstery and curtains and to a lesser extent for carpets.

Carpet shampoo machines: These machines, as indicated by the name, are designed for the deep cleaning of carpets that are heavily soiled.

Types of carpet shampoo machines: There are 4 broad groups of these machines:

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Steam-extraction  machines: Though  these  machines  are  universally  called  steam extraction machines, there is in fact no generation of steam and the cleaning agents are simply  hot  water  and  detergent.  Hot  water  containing  the  detergent  is  injected  at  a prescribed  rate  and  subsequently  extracted  by  a  wet  vacuum  system  built  into  the machine.

Cylindrical-brush  dry-foam  machines: This  system  has  a  cylindrical  brush  that scrubs that scrubs and picks up in one pass, the foam generated by the machine.

Rotary-brush wet-shampoo machines: A rotary brush cleaner in conjunction with a wet shampoo is employed for the cleaning of carpets here. The machine comes with a range of accessories including vacuum and drying equipment.

Small rotary-brushes wet-shampoo machines: This is also a rotary brush cleaner, but employs 2 brushes instead of 1 and is somewhat smaller than the rotary-brush wetshampoo machine.

## Scrubber-drier

These machines remove debris, soiling and/or water. They are suitable for large areas where mechanical sweeping, scrubbing and drying are required.

Types of scrubber-drier-sweepers: The various types available are as follows:

Power sweepers: These are self-propelled or manually propelled machines designed to remove debris and loosen soiling from roads, pavements, carpets and large areas of hard flooring.

Pedestrian-driven  sweepers: These  feature  a  battery  or  mains-operated  rotating broom that carries dirt back into a hopper. A side-broom suction unit and filters may be included.

Petrol or gas-driven sweepers: These have petrol or a gas-powered engine to drive a suction unit and brush. Soiling is brushed back into the inflow and collected in a large cloth sack situated behind the motor. These machines are suitable for the sweeping of pavements, car parks and similar heavy-traffic areas.

Self-propelled sweepers: These machines may be petrol, gas or battery-powered. The power is transferred to the drive wheels and a rotating broom, which carries soiling away from a surface.

## Such machines typically contain:

-  A side broom to carry debris from the floor edges into the path of the main broom.
-  A water spray or suction with the side broom to prevent rising of dust clouds.
-  A high volume suction-unit that sucks or blows air through a filter as dust or dirt is deposited in the hopper.
-  A filter shaker or air-flow reverser to prevent blockages.

## 4.4.3 Selection of Equipments

The  housekeeper  has  a  great  responsibility  when  choosing  equipment  since  a  poor choice  can  prove  less  efficient  than  desired  and  more  costly  than  it  should  be.  It's necessary  to  be  able  to  justify  its  use  in  terms  of  saving  time  and  labor,  hence  the saving of money and it's efficiency in obtaining a good result

Quality  and  durability: quality  and  durability  of  equipment  should  be  checked before  selection  of  any  equipment.  Quality  of  equipment  can  be  found  from  the organization that has already used these machines. We can get a feedback from them if it is satisfactory. Then we can purchase the machine

Reliability :  reliability  of  a  supplier  to  meet  the  deadline of time that the equipment should be supplied of time that the equipment should be supplied on time

Purpose of the equipment :  this is a very important point to be kept in mind before purchasing any equipment. It should be very clear that for what the equipment is being purchased, what would be its use and function and also where it will be used

Transportation : transportation  on  time  to  replenish  stock.  That  is  gathering information whether the supplier has enough facilities to transport the equipment or not. Therefore it is better to have a contract with the local office equipment should be light when balanced and easy to manipulate. Availability of future stock so that there is no problem for more stock or replacement of spare parts

Knowledge :  knowledge in term of usage. People handling the equipment should be educated and the equipment must be one which can be easily operated

Cost factor :  whether the organization is capable of spending so much or not on the basis of the equipments are chosen

## 4.4.4 Care and Storage of Equipments

Preventive  maintenance: a  preventive  check  of  the  all  housekeeping  equipment should  be  done  at  least  once  a  month,  the  preventive  check  can  be  done  in  the maintenance  department  or  the  dealers  of  the  equipment  by  conducting  preventive maintenance we can ensure the machine would lost longer and would be noise free.

Proper handling of the machine: it  should be cleaned and dried after use to avoid from  rusting.  The  bags  and  filters  of  the  machine  should  be  changed  as  and  when required.

Training: the staff should be trained when the new equipment's are introduced to the departments  are  introduced  to  the  department.  All  the  staff  should  be  taught  the operation of new equipment's so that misuse of equipment's can be avoided.

Storage: the equipment should be stored in a damp free atmosphere to prevent from rusting and the stores to be well ventilated.

The machines should be labeled for easy identification .

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Stock records: should be maintained to keep check on the number of the equipment's being purchased and stored, the number of equipment's discarded and the number of equipment's in use.

Certain rules: certain rules must be followed regarding issue of stock e.g. A dry can be fixed for issue of stocks so all the staff of the department  are  aware  of the new equipment's that is being introduced into the department.

Expensive  equipments: expensive  equipment's  should  be  covered  with  polythene and kept in place to avoid rusting if not in used.

Equipment inventory: monthly inventory of equipments is very important to have a record for the type, number and upkeep of the equipment

Maintain logs: maintain log for equipment that is issued by the housekeeping staff or borrowed by other department.

## 4.5 Composition, care and cleaning of metals

Metals are found in various forms, in different areas, in all hospitality establishments. It  forms  the  whole  or  some  part  many  fixture,  fittings  and  items  of  furniture.  Most commonly used metals are:

-  Silver
-  Steel
-  Copper
-  Bras
-  Bronze,
-  Aluminium
-  Iron

These  metals  may  be  used  in  door  and  window  fittings,  wall  panels,  light  fittings, sanitaryware,  restaurant  cutlery,  cooking  utensils,  guestroom  accessories  (such  as ashtrays, vases, and picture frames), and furniture (such as beds, chairs, and tables). Most  metal  surfaces  get  tarnished,  scratched,  or  rusted  unless  treated  or  protected. These  metals  may  be  used  in  door  and  window  fittings,  wall  panels,  light  fittings, sanitaryware,  restaurant  cutlery,  cooking  utensils,  guestroom  accessories  (such  as ashtrays, vases, and picture frames), and furniture (such as beds, chairs, and tables). Most metal surfaces get tarnished, scratched, or rusted unless treated or protected.

## 4.5.1 Protective Finishes on Metals

Painting: Paint  may  be  applied  to  steel  and  wrought  iron  to  make  them  look decorative. Paint also prevents exposure of the metal surface to air containing oxygen and moisture. Before painting, the metal must be cleaned to remove surface dust and any traces of rust. Any damage to the paintwork should be repaired immediately.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Electroplating: This  is  done  using  the  process  of  electrolysis.  In  this  process, protective  or  decorative  metals  such  as  chromium,  zinc,  tin,  silver  or  gold  are deposited on brass, steel, or copper. It is a very durable finish.

Galvanizing: In this process, the base metal usually steel or iron is coated with a layer of zinc to avoid corrosion. This is not used as a decorative finish. Rather, galvanizing makes  the  article  more  durable.  It  is  a  treatment  extensively  used  for  buckets, dustbins, and sinks.

Enameling: In this process, molten glass is applied to metal surfaces such as steel and iron, which later sets to form a transparent, tough, smooth, and easily cleaned surface. The enamel may 'craze' (crack on the surface) on wear, however.

Lacquering: In  this  process,  shellac  dissolved  in  alcohol  is  coated  over  brass  or copper to reduce tarnishing.

Anodizing: This  is  another  electrolytic  treatment  by  which  aluminium  is  protected from  corrosion.  It  also  acts  as  a  decorative  finish  by  enhancing  the  appearance  of aluminium.  Anodized  aluminium  is  now  extensively  used  for  door  and  window fittings.

Tin-plating: In  this  process,  steel  or  copper  is  dipped  into  molten  tin  to  render  it corrosion resistant.

Plastic-coating: Plastics  can  be  coated  over  steel  and  iron  for  colour  coding  (as  in pipes) or for decorative purposes.

## 4.5.2 Commonly used Metals and Alloys

SILVER: This soft, malleable, ductile metal has a brilliant sheen when well polished. Small amounts of the metal in elemental form occur naturally in the earth, but most of the silver we use is extracted from silver ores. Silver is chemically unaffected by pure water, pure air, and a majority of food stuffs, but gets scratched easily if pure. Silver is used as the plating in electroplated nickel silver, for making cutlery, utensils, vases, and decorative artifacts.

## Types of Silver

- a. Sterling silver
- b. Silver plated ( EPNS)

Sterling Silver: Sterling silver is an alloy containing 92.5 per cent silver, and the rest is mainly copper. Sterling silver is more expensive than silver-plated alloy and for this reason is seldom used in hotels.

Silver-Plated  (EPNS): Table silver  or  ‗silverware'  is  usually  made  of  silver-plated alloy by plating ‗blanks' of nickel silver alloy. ‗Nickel silver' does not  contain any silver at  all;  It  (Nickel  Silver)  is  a  term  for  alloys  that  look  like  silver  (being  white metal) and made of nickel, copper, and often (but not always) brass, along with a few other metals for added strength and shine.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Cleaning  Procedures: Silver  needs  to  be  cleaned  and  polished  on  a  regular  basis. When it gets tarnished, more complex cleaning methods have to be employed.

## Following are the cleaning & polishing methods for silver:

- i. Regular Cleaning
- ii. Silver Dip
- iii. Polivit or Aluminium-Soda method
- iv. Burnishing Machine
- v. Plate-Powder Method

## I. Regular Cleaning

-  Wash the article in a hot solution of synthetic detergent, scrubbing with a piece of cotton cloth.
-  Then rinse in clean boiling water in an enameled tray.
-  A sheet of alunimium and some soda can be placed in the tray.
-  Once the articles are clean, drain the water away and wipe dry while it is still warm, rubbing hard with a lint-free linen cloth or chamois leather.

## II. Silver-Dip Method

-  A silver dip solution is used when tarnished silver is to be cleaned.
-  It  is  usually a pink coloured liquid based on an acid solution of a compound into which the articles are immersed completely for removal of tarnish.
-  The silver should remain in the liquid for a very short time, the articles should be lifted out, washed with warm water and dried.
-  While  working  with  silver  dip,  stainless  steel  containers  should  not  be  used since the dip attacks steel.
-  Enamel or plastic containers must be used instead.
-  Silver  dip  should  not  be  used  too  frequently  on  the  silver,  either,  since  it  is harder  on  silver  because  of  a  chemical  reaction  between  the  silver  and  the liquid that can corrode the metal.
-  However, many establishments use silver dip frequently since it is faster than other methods.

## III. Polivit Method

-  Polivit is an aluminium metal sheet containing holes, which is best used in an enamel bowl or galvanized iron bowl.
-  The polivit is placed in the bowl together with some soda.
-  The silver to be cleaned is then put into the bowl, ensuring that at least the one piece of silver has contact with the polivit.
-  Sufficient  boiling  water  is  poured  into  the  bowl  to  cover  the  silver  being cleaned has contact with the polivit.
-  A chemical reaction takes place between the polivit, soda, boiling water and silver which causes the tarnish to be lifted.
-  After 2-4 minutes, silver should be removed from the bowl and placed into the 2nd bowl of boiling and then rinsed.
-  On  removal  from  the  second  bowl  the  silver  is  allowed  to  drain  and  then polished with a clean cloth and then dried with a tea cloth.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

## IV. Burnishing Machine

-  This is a revolving drum with a safety shield. In this revolving drum, highly polished steel balls are immersed in a detergent solution with silver articles.
-  The machine rotates and the friction from the steel balls polishes the silver.
-  These articles are then rinsed into hot water and dried.
-  The burnishing machine is used for polishing large quantities of silver articles.
-  Care should be taken to keep the ball bearings covered with water when not in use, since they rust rapidly otherwise.
-  Plate-Powder Method
-  This pink powder should be mixed with just enough methylated spirit to make a smooth paste.
-  Alternatively  water  may  be  used;  but  methylated  spirit  is  preferred  since  it evaporates faster and the silverware is then available for polishing much more quickly.
-  The smooth paste is rubbed thoroughly onto the silver article with a clean rag and left to dry. It is then rubbed off with rags.
-  The article should now be rinsed well in boiling water and buffed with a clean cloth.
-  Though this method is time consuming but it gives a good result.

STEEL: Steel is an alloy of iron. The alloy contains mainly iron and carbon; other materials are found in small quantities. It is used in the form of pressed chrome steel for  the  manufacture  of  baths,  sinks,  and  so  on.  Stainless  steel  is  used  in  making cutlery, protective paneling, sanitary ware, furniture, trays, and cooking utensils. Steel is  sometimes  galvanized  or  enameled  to  prevent  corrosion.  If  an  enameled  steel surface gets stained, it can be washed with a mild liquid abrasive.

## Types of steel commonly used

- i. Chrome Steel
- ii. Stainless Steel
- iii. Galvanized Steel

Chrome Steel: Steel is coated with chromium for manufacturing taps, bath handles, shower fittings, and so on. These can become spotted with water marks or get greased, but they do not tarnish.

Stainless  Steel: This  is  steel  to  which  8-25  per  cent  of  chromium  has  been  added, making it corrosion-resistant. Stainless steel is tough, durable, and can take a mirrorpolished finish. It is used in making cutlery, sinks, WCs, and so on. For spoons and forks, steel containing 18 per cent chromium and 8 per cent nickel is generally used. However, even stainless steel can be harmed by silver-dip solutions, acidic solutions, salt-vinegar mixtures, and excessive heat.

Galvanized Steel: Steel may be coated with zinc (galvanized) to prevent tarnishing. This kind of steel is used for making buckets.

Cleaning  Procedures:  Stainless  steel is  washed  in  a  hot  solution  of  synthetic detergent using a soft nylon scrubber, rinsed with clean water and immediately dried thoroughly with a linen cloth. The use of harsh abrasives should be avoided as they

may  scratch  the  surface. Chrome steel  and  galvanized  steel are  wiped  or  washed with  synthetic  detergent  solution,  stains  removed  with  soft  steel-wool,  the  articles rinsed  with  clean  water,  and  buffed  with  a  linen  cloth.  For  cleaning  greasy stains, sodium bicarbonate can be used on all types of steel.

COPPER: This metal with an orange-brown shade has a light sheen of its own. It is used for wall paneling and counter tops in bars and restaurants; bowls, vases, and urns in lobbies and guestrooms; and utensils in the kitchen. Copper is even used in cutlery and  serving  dishes  in  some  ethnic  Indian  restaurants.  Copper  cookware  should  be lined with tin or nickel for protection, as the copper may react adversely with some foods.

## Cleaning Procedure

-  Copper is washed in warm water and then rubbed with a mixture of salt, fine sand, and vinegar, using rags, to clean.
-  It is then rinsed in warm water and dried with a smooth cloth. A thin coat of vegetable oil is applied to the surface to retard further tarnish.
-  In case of heavily tarnished copper, a weak ammonia solution will remove the greenish deposits on the surface.

BRASS: This is a golden-brown alloy of copper and zinc. It is used in making door and  window  fittings,  stair  rods  and  railings,  foot  rails  in  bars,  taps,  ashtrays,  and ornaments.  Brass  tarnishes  and  scratches  easily.  To  avoid  this,  brass  fixtures  are usually lacquered.

## Cleaning Procedure

-  To clean brass articles,  remove surface dirt with a duster and rub the article with a paste made of white flour, salt, and vinegar in equal parts.
-  This will remove mild tarnish. Make sure to rub away all the mixture.
-  Corroded  brass  should  be  treated  with  spirit  of  salt  (hydrochloric  acid)  and then rinsed thoroughly.
-  Polish with Brasso, using damp rags or cotton
-  A long-term hard-metal polish can also be used on brass.

BRONZE\  GUN  METAL: This  is  a  brown  alloy  of  copper  and  tin.  It  is  used primarily in making works of art and medals. It does not tarnish easily.

## Cleaning Procedure

-  To clean a bronze article, wash well with water and then apply a mixture of one part muriatic acid and two parts water with a piece of flannel.
-  Allow the solution to dry and then polish the bronze well with vegetable oil.

ALUMINUM: This silvery, lightweight metal is highly malleable, and ductile. It is used to make light fittings, and other utensils. Aluminum is not tarnished by air. It is, however,  damaged  by  soda  and  other  alkalis  as  well  as  stained  by  acids.  It  also scratches and bends easily.

## Cleaning Procedure

-  To clean aluminum, wash in a hot solution of synthetic detergents, using soft steel-wool to scrub.
-  Use mild abrasives only in the case of difficult stains.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

-  Discoloration in saucepans can be removed by boiling a solution of water and lemon juice in them, rinsing and then drying.
-  In  case  of  aluminum showpieces, some liquid wax polish may be applied to maintain the gloss.

IRON: This silver-white metal of great strength is used in making furniture, buckets, dustbins, and cookware. Iron can be forged or cast. Wrought iron is iron that has been forged, that is, it has been shaped by heating in fire and then hammering while hot. Cast iron is a hard alloy of iron, carbon, and silicon that has been cast in a mould. Non-enameled cast iron is flame and oven proof.

## Maintenance

-  Utensils  made  of  cast  iron  need  to  be  seasoned  before  first  use  to  prevent rusting.
-  Before seasoning, the article has to be washed in mild soap and water, then thoroughly dried.
-  Seasoning is done by rubbing the inside surface with vegetable oil and heating in a slow oven for about two hours.
-  Enameled cast-iron utensils do not need seasoning and are easier to clean.
-  If handled carelessly, however, the enamel may chip away.
-  If the utensils are put under cold water immediately after use, while still hot, the enamel may gain flake off.
-  Therefore, before cleaning, allow the utensil to cool gradually.
-  Cleaning Procedure
-  Unprotected iron should be washed only when necessary and then thoroughly dried.
-  Galvanized iron needs regular washing and thorough drying.
-  Rust  can  be  removed  from  galvanized  items  with  fine  steel-wool  dampened with oxalic acid.
-  Do not store iron in damp areas.
-  Before long-term storage, coat with oil or black lead (graphite).

PEWTER: Pewter  is  a  metal  alloy  that  is  used  to  produce  home  decor  items, jewelry,  and  tableware.Made  mostly  from  tin.  Pewter  can  also  consist  of  copper, antimony, bismuth, and lead. A malleable alloy, pewter can be molded, hammered, stamped,  spun,  or  casted  to  create  figurines,  objects,  or  charms.  Elements  like stained  or  fused  glass,  ceramic,  or  enamel  can  be  incorporated  into  a  composite pewter piece to complement the pewter's appearance.

## Types and Finishes

To  regulate  the  quality  of  pewter,  oversight  organizations  were  formed  to standardize the metal's composition into a number of purity grades. The techniques used to fashion pewter grew more varied as time passed as metalworkers developed finishes that could be applied over any grade of pewter to dramatically changed its appearance.  Identifying  the  grade  and  finish  of  a  pewter  piece  is  the  first  step  in determining the best cleaning method to use.

| Pewter  grade   | Also known  as...   |               | Composition  Uses                 |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| First           | Fine metal          | 99%  tin  and | Tableware, drinkware, and jewelry |

|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Second  Grade | 96%  tin  and  4% lead  Holloware like sugar bowls, platters,  and pitchers                   |
| Third  Grade  | 85%  tin  and  15% lead  Any  other  application  other  than  food-related items and jewelry |

Pewter Finishes: Pewter objects often have a finish applied which could be one of three types:

Polished  finish :  Polished  pewter  is  the  most  common  and  has  a  smooth,  shiny surface which can withstand more frequent cleaning than satin or oxidized finishes.

Satin  finish :  Satin  pewter  has  a  rough,  grainy  appearance  with  a  dull  sheen  that should not be removed to brighten the look of the piece.

Oxidized finish .  Oxidized pewter has a darkening solution applied to it to achieve an aged look intentionally.

Pewter  Care  and  cleaning: Preventative  measures  should  be  implemented whenever  handling  pewter  to  prevent  damage  or  staining.  Pewter  has  a  very  low melting point of 450 degrees Fahrenheit, so never place pewter items in the oven, on a heat source like a hot plate or stove, or near an open flame. Acids and sulfur can cause pitting or staining on pewter, so foods with high levels of acid or sulfur, like citrus, eggs, or salad dressings, should be washed off pewter items immediately after use. Washing pewter by hand is preferred over using a dishwasher.

Polished Pewter: Polished pewter is a popular finish because it is very smooth and shiny.  This  reflectiveness,  however,  also  makes  this  finish  vulnerable  to  scratches and the appearance of dust or grime. Of the three types of pewter finishes, polished pewter is the one that requires the most cleaning.

-  Professional Polish :  Polishes  designed specifically for all metals can be used to clean pewter in a safe and effective way. Before using, look at  the  manufacturer  recommendations  which  should  accompany all metal  polish and  follow  the  instructions  carefully  to  produce  the  best results.
-  Homemade  Pewter  Polish :  Most  of  the  ingredients  needed  for  this method  are  easily  found  around  the  house,  with  the  exception of rottenstone and linseed oil. Rottenstone is another name  for decomposed lime and is sold in powder form.

Satin  Finish  Pewter: Routine  cleaning  consists  of  washing  the  pewter  piece  in warm water with a mild dish soap and a sponge. Once a year, however, it could be put through a thorough cleaning process that includes using very fine steel wool to get  rid  of  any  dust  or  grime.  Start  off  with  washing  the  pewter  piece  with  warm water,  a  sponge,  and  mild  dish  soap,  then  dry  completely.  Buff  the  surface  of  the pewter lightly with the steel wool, making sure to rub in the direction of the pewter's grain, until the whole piece has been covered. Rinse the piece again in warm water and dry with a soft towel.

Oxidized Pewter: Oxidized pewter pieces, which have a dark finish, are the easiest pieces  to  clean.  Simply  wash  with  warm  water  and  mild  dish  detergent  using  a sponge. Dry with a soft cloth when finished.

## 5.1   Introduction

Furniture  can  be  a  product  of  design  and  is  considered  a  form  of decorative  art.  In addition  to  furniture's  functional  role,  it  can  serve  a  symbolic  or  religious  purpose Wall  coverings  maybe  purely  decorative,  in  which  case,  ability  to  bring  colour, pattern, texture, light or shade to the room maybe of the greatest importance. On the other  hand  the  covering  maybe  required  to  give  an  easily  cleaned  and  hygienic surface. Floor is important aspect of interior decoration. Floors are both functional and decorative and play an important part in the cleaning and maintenance program of any hotel. They cover a large area and are subjected to a great deal of wear and tear.

The word textile is derived from the Latin term -texture‖ for woven fabrics. Thus by textiles  we  understand  those  objects  which  have  been  prepared  by  weaving.  Textile has an important bearing on our daily lives and everyone needs to know about textiles as we use them in some way or the other. Yarns are produced by twisting or spinning of  the  textile  fibres  and  in  turn  fabric  is  a  structure  produced  by  interlacing  or interloping of the yarns. There are certain terms which are used very often in the study of textiles that are to be understood first.

A -fibre - are product capable of being woven or otherwise made into fabric. These fibres are of many types. Soft furnishing are piece of items that are both necessary for comfort and convenience as well as decorative, providing colour, pattern and texture to  the  room.  Soft  furnishings  include fibres that are used for curtains, loose covers, cushions,  bedspreads  and  quilts. Some  articles  in  addition  provide  warmth  and comfort. Each article is subjected to variable amount of wear and tear.

## 5.3   Furniture

Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating and sleeping. Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks, or to stores things. Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture.

## SELECTION OF FURNITURE

Comfort : office furniture should be comfortable. Comfortable furniture will result in increased efficiency of the employees

Aesthetic Appeal Purchase furniture that complements the existing décor with the color  scheme.  It  should  enhance  the  overall  appearance  of  your  interiors.  A  good design elevates the mood of both employees and guest and keeps their stress levels low.

Design :  design of furniture relates with height and width, color, number of drawers, and so on. No matter what, furniture should support the space and must facilitate the works done.

Cost : cost of furniture is a very important factor to be considered before selecting any machine. The furniture should be within the budget of an office

Durability : office furniture should be made up of steel rather than wood because steel furniture is compatible and lost lasting. Office furniture can be expensive and it is not possible  to  purchase  new  furniture  every  year  because  it  doesn't  even  support  the space.  Therefore,  the  furniture  to  be  purchased  must  be  free  from  problem  of breakage.

Multiple uses : furniture should be usable for numerous purposes in the office.

Safety : office furniture should be safe. Glass topped and sharp cornered furniture are relatively unsafe.

Saving space : choice of furniture also depends upon the space occupied by furniture. Such  furniture  should  be  selected  which  would  occupy  minimum  office  space. Bulky and space occupying furniture indirectly add office cost.

Portability :  the  furniture  being  portable  can  be  easily  shifted  from  one  room  to another, one building to another and form one location to another.

## TYPES OF FURNITURE

There are primarily four types of furniture fond I hotel guest room based on way they are placed.

Free-standing furniture: The  furniture  that  can  be  rearranged  whenever  necessary but  the  disadvantage  is  that  they  accumulate  dust  behind,  above  and  beneath  them. E.g. chairs, tables, beds etc.

Cantilevered furniture :  These types of furniture's fitted to the wall on brackets so there is no legs.

Built-in furniture :  The  piece  of  furniture  is  fitted  ad  fixed  into  architectural  space. Usually their cost is incorporated into the building cost. Since built in furniture has no gap behind, above or below so cleaning is minimized. However, the disadvantage is that once built in the particular piece of furniture cannot be moved, thus reducing its flexibility.

Fitted furniture: Though the terms built-in and fitted are often used interchangeable. Fitted furniture is made to fit into existing alcoves, thereby saving space. The room appears more spacious and streamline when fitted furniture.

## Based on other characteristics, furniture may also be categorized as follows:

Antique furniture: It includes pieces from an earlier period. It is often crafted out of wood and its age, condition, unique features and rarity determine how collectible the piece is and therefore, how high its value. Genuine antiques are, by definition, at least 100 years old considered an antique.

Upholstery: Upholstery with fabrics and its techniques had been mastered by the end of  the  17 th century,  by  borrowing  splendid  material  and  lavish  trimmings.   Initially these were detachable loose covers, which were later converted to fixed upholstery. These  wrappings  were  supposed  to  be  removed  when  the  furniture  was  used. Tapestries,  furniture  and  carpets  beside  silk  damasks  and  velvets  were  mostly produced in France and Italy.

Modular furniture :  These types of furniture are based on standardise measurement or module, so that different pieces can be joint together with verity of ways. One of the  major  benefits  of  modular  furniture  is,  it  can  be  resembled  and  dismantled whenever required in short period of time.

## USES OF WOOD IN FURNITURE MAKING

There are two types of wood in use hard wood & soft wood

-  Hard wood
-  Soft wood

Hard wood: It is strong and is used for Hardwood, being harder and heavier, tends to be  sturdier  and  longer-lasting.  Additionally,  hardwoods  are  more  resistant  to  decay than  softwoods.  The  biggest  drawback  for  quality  hardwood  is  its  high  cost.  They include teak, mahogany, oak walnut and beech.

Soft wood: Softwood is also generally more pliable, making it an easier material to work with and hence cheaper to manufacture. However, due to its lack of density, it can  scratch  and  damage  more  easily.  Consequently,  softwood  furniture  needs  more

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

care than hardwood. Such as pine, dell and fir are used for construction of furniture, subfloor, joints, ceilings, broom handles, etc., where the wood is either covered up or out of public view.

## WOOD PRODUCTS

These are less expensive as compared to solid wood items. The most commonly used ones include: -

Plywood -  It  is  made  by  bonding  together  a  number  of  thin  sheets  (piles)  of  wood (usually  hardwood) in such a way that the grain of one sheet lies at right angles to those on either side of it. It can be bent to any shape during manufacture and may have as many as nine piles. It's very strong and maybe covered with plastic laminate or a hardwood veneer.

Chipboard - It  is  used  extensively for  worktops, wardrobes, chests of drawers, etc. and nearly always has a wood veneer or plastic laminate. It is heavy and strong but flexible. It is made by mixing wood chips with a synthetic resin adhesive.

Hardboard -  It  is  more  flexible  than  chipboard  and  much  thinner.  Made  from compressed brown fireboard, it is smooth on one side with a mesh texture on other. Hardboard is used as a backing for wardrobes, base of drawers, door panels, backing for pictures, base for floor tiles, etc.

Block boards - This consists of strips of wood between veneers. The inner strips of wood  are  fairly  thick  (up  to  30  mm)  making  it  a  strong  material  usually  used  for making shelves and table tops.

Wood products are nearly always faced with a plastic laminate, sun mica, Formica or wood veneer. Hence they should be cleaned according to their outer surface. However all of them will deteriorate if excessive amount of water is allowed to penetrate.

## PROTECTING WOOD SURFACES

Unprotected wood surfaces will absorb moisture, which causes the grains to swell and so creates gap into which dirt and germs can fall and become trapped when it dries. Liquids  such  as  coffee  and  wine  leave  a  stain  on  the  surface,  which  is  difficult  to remove, and scratching is difficult to avoid, particularly on floors. The following are the  most  commonly  found  methods  of  protection  and  maybe  referred  to  as wood finishes .

Cellulose lacquer - This is fairly durable matt applied to solid timber furniture during manufacture. It should be dusted and wiped with a damp cloth and then dried with a soft one. Cream or spray polish may be applied to give a gloss finish. Heat, water and solvents will cause damage.

French  polish -  This  is  also  easily  damaged  by  heat,  water  and  solvents. Deterioration  is  caused  by  light  and  atmosphere  in  general.  French  polishing  is produced by rubbing the solid wooden surface with a solution of Shellac (a dark red resin) and methylated spirits. It should be dusted daily and polished in the way of the grain.  Occasionally  cream,  liquid  or  paste  polish  maybe  applied  to  remove  light soiling and improve the gloss.

Oil -  Solid  wooden  furniture  can  be  given  a  matt  protective  finish  by  rubbing  the surface with a mixture of oil (usually linseed oil) and resin. This process gives very

little protection although it will help to reduce the absorption of water. Daily dusting is essential. Marks can be removed by lightly rubbing with very fine steel wool. About twice  a  year  the  surface  should  be  rubbed  with  a  mixture  of  equal  quantities  of turpentine and raw linseed oil. Proprietary polishes should be avoided.

Paint - This is very widely used on furniture, window frames, doorframes, skirting, staircase railings, etc. Gloss paint is tougher than matt or silk and will withstand more frequent washings. All painted wood surfaces should be dusted daily and wiped with a synthetic detergent solution or solvent weekly. Spray or cream polishes can be used to retain the shine or gloss on surfaces. Heat, alkalis and abrasives easily damage paint.

Resin  (varnish ) -  Natural  and  synthetic  resins  such  as  polyesters,  melamine  and polyurethane  are  used  extensively  on  wooden  furniture,  window  frames,  skirting, floors  and  staircases.  The  finish  maybe  glossy  or  matt  and  is  frequently  applied  to furniture made from chipboard. Resin is extremely tough and will resist heat, water, solvents and abrasives; but once damaged by scratching or chipping, it is very difficult to repair. Dusting should be done regularly. Cream or spray polish should be applied on glossy surface after damp wiping. Matt surface should be rubbed up occasionally using a mixture of 500ml turpentine, 100ml boiled linseed oil and 500ml vinegar.

Wax (bees wax) -  This  is  applied  on  solid  wood  surfaces.  It  provides  an  attractive finish,  exposing  the  pattern  of  the  wood,  but  is  easily  damaged  by  heat,  water  and solvents. Waxed surfaces should be dusted daily and cleaned weekly with cream and liquid polish.

## REMOVING STAIN FROM WOODEN SURFACES

Alcohol  stain -  Polish  well.  If  the  stain  persists  rub  along  the  grain  with  a  metal polish or a mixture of linseed oil and cigarette ash.

Burns (black marks) - Rub with metal polish. For wax or oil finishes, rub the mark hard with turpentine.

Heat marks (white rings) - Rub with turpentine in the direction of the grain.

Ink Dab with vinegar, leave for 2-3 hrs, then wipe. If unsuccessful, use a matchstick or cotton wool and carefully dab with hypochlorite bleach, immediately wiping with a clean cloth or absorbent paper.

Scratches - Mask with similar coloured wax crayon, shoe polish or liquid polish dye.

Watermarks - Rub with turpentine in the direction of the grain. If the stain persists, rub with metal polish, followed with suitable furniture polish.

## CANE, WICKER AND BAMBOO

These  are  names  given  to  items  made  from  thick  grasses  (bamboo),  palms  (cane), willow sheets (wicker). They have similar characteristics to timber products but are usually woven or plaited into chairs, tables, headboards, etc. They are easily damaged and regular cleaning is necessary. Cleaning includes brushing or vacuuming everyday and wiping approximately once a week with a solution of warm water and washing soda or solution of 5ml borax in 50-ml water. Both methods should be followed by

rinsing  with  cold  water  in  strands.  Oil  or  wax  polish  maybe  applied  to  polished surfaces. Items used for food items should not be polished e.g. breadbaskets.

Wall  coverings  maybe  purely  decorative,  in  which  case,  ability  to  bring  colour, pattern, texture, light or shade to the room maybe of the greatest importance. On the other  hand  the  covering  maybe  required  to  give  an  easily  cleaned  and  hygienic surface. The choice is very wide and the style should suit the purpose, furnishing and the architectural aspects of the room.

## SELECTION OF WALL COVERING

Contribution to décor: The  colour,  texture  and  pattern  will  influence  the  apparent warmth and dimension of the room and the level and type of illumination used. The type of room, its existing size and decoration must be considered.

Ease of cleaning: Smooth, hard, impervious surface, preferably light coloured can be cleaned easily whereas textured surfaces tend to attract and hold dust

State of existing surface: Textured and patterned finishes can be used to mask poor surface  Resistance  to  abrasion  and  knocks:  -  Hard  surfaces  will  be  best  for  this purpose.

Stain resistance: A non-porous surface has more resistance than porous ones.

Durability: Surfaces  subject  to  abuse,  knocks,  stains  and  abrasion  require  finishes that are resistant, can be cleaned easily, inexpensively restored or repaired whenever required.

Life expectancy: Where décor of the room is intended to change relatively frequently, less expensive finishes are appropriate.

Insulation: How-much-ever possible finishes with good sound insulation properties should be selected.

Cost: While  comparing  cost  of  different  finishes,  not  only  should  the  cost  of  the material and its application be considered; but also the cost of its damage restoration and expected frequency of complete redecoration should be borne in mind.

## Paints and lacquers

Paints can be applied to almost any surface providing it is free from water, grease or dust and is of sound construction. E.g. plaster must be smooth, hard and not flaking from the underlying plaster or brickwork. As wall covering paints offer a wide choice of  types,  colors,  degrees  of  gloss  and  designs  (murals  can  be  painted).  For  window frames  and  sills,  door  and  skirting  boards,  slightly  glossy  paint  is  required  so  that along with providing a contrast in colour and texture to the main wall finish, it acts as a protective coating, and thus contributing to décor of the room. It is relatively cheap, easily applied and cleaned and can give a textured and multicolored effect. The only disadvantage is that it shows soils (especially for matt paints) and wall imperfections (in gloss paints) more readily than any other wall covering.

Paints are typically mixture of four ingredients: pigments, additives, binders and solvents. Pigments are colors; additives give the paints the special properties such as resistance  to  rust  and  fungus.  Binders  hold  the  paints  together.  Solvents  enable  the brushing and rolling easier. Depending on the binders or vehicles used, paints can be broadly classified into two classes:

- 1 Water base
- 2. Solvents based

## WATER BASED

Paints  in  these  types  the  contents  are  mixed  with  water  only.  The  various  types  of water based paints are

Lime wash -  These  are  color  washes  based  on  lime  (calcium hydroxide), inorganic alkalis,  fast  pigments,  and  few  other  additives.  White  wash  are  lime  wash  without pigments.

DistemperThis is superior to lime wash and is available in a wide range of color. It consists  of  powered  chalk,  some  coloring  pigment  and  glue  mixed  with  water.  It  is economical even in new buildings.

Emulsion paints - They are water thinned but are based on dispersions of synthetic resins  (e.g.  polyvinyl  acetate).  They  are  tough,  washable  and  wear  resistant;  and available in varying degrees of sheen, from matt, to semi-gloss, to silk finish. They are  quick  drying,  low  in  odor  and  very  suitable  for  redecoration  of  rooms,  which cannot remain long out of use.

Cement  This  types  of  paints  consist  of  white  cement,  alkali  fast  pigments, accelerators,  and  other  additives.  It  is  available  as  dry  power  and  can  be  found  in several shades. It is economical, water resistant and durable in damp surfaces.

## SOLVENT BASED PAINTS

These are generally made of six constituent. Base, filler, coloring pigments, vehicle, solvent and dryer.

The base : it is generally metallic oxide in powered form and is chief constituent of the paints. They may be white lead, red lead, zinc oxide, iron oxide etc

The filler : Cheap pigments added to the paints to reduce its cost.

Coloring pigments : A white or coloring pigment mixed into to get desire shades.

Vehicle: It is liquid acts as binders for the various pigments.

Solvent: It is a liquid that thins the consistency of the paints and evaporates when it applied to the surface so that it may solidify. Turpentine, pure oils, petroleum, spirit etc are used as solvent.

Dryer: one of the groups of materials containing metallic compounds that are used in small amounts for accelerating the drying of the paint film

The different types of solvent based paints available are:

Alloy paints - They are based on synthetic resins combined with vegetable oil such as linseed oil. The conventional types were natural resins, which are still used in primers and  undercoat  paints.  Alloyed  paints  are  generally  easier  to  apply  and  have  better durability and wearing properties than any other type. Polyutherene and silicone are sometimes included to give more scratch resistant surface. They are available in gloss, silk and flat finishes.

Multicolored paints - They are usually dispersions of cellulose colors in water. Each colour  is  present  in  separate  -blobs  -or  -spots‖.  The  resulting  effect  depends  on number  of  different  colors,  degree  of  contrast  between  them  and  the  size  and distribution  of  spots.  This  paint  should  be  applied  by  spraying.  It  is  extremely hardwearing and the multicolor effect helps in hiding irregularities and imperfections. It is usually applied on walls of corridors, sanitary accommodations, and similar areas, to  give  a  stain  and  abrasion  resistant  finish,  which  can  be  washed  and  cleaned regularly.

Textured or Plastic paints - They are usually plaster based and are intended to give a  textured  or  relief  effect  on  surface.  The  texture  is  obtained  by  working  over  the material  after  application  and  while  it  is  still  wet,  using  combs,  palette,  knives, strippers, etc. Some are self-colored while others may require painting when they dry. The modern types are based on heavy-bodied synthetic resin  emulsion  and may be applied by spraying directly on the concrete or similar surfaces; thus eliminating the need of plaster.

Micro porous paints - they have a rubberized base which gives little gloss but offers elasticity and allowing movement when the surface expands or contracts.

Aluminum paints Theses are use for painting wood and metal surface. Aluminum powder forms the base in this type of paint.

Anti-corrosive  paints -  They  are  generally  used  as  metal-protection  paints  for preserving  metallic  structure  against  the  adverse  effect  of  whether  fumes,  corrosive chemicals, etc.

Bituminous paints -  They  are  also  used  for  waterproofing  and  protecting  iron  and steel. These paints usually consist of asphalt, bitumen and pitch dissolved in spirit or naphtha. These paints deteriorate when exposed on the direct rays of the sun.

Bronze  paints -  These  types  of  paints  is  used  for  painting  for  interior  or  exterior metallic surfaces. Aluminum bronze, copper powder is the pigment use in this types of paints.

Enamel paints - This type of paint is made by adding pigments such as white lead or (Pb) or zinc white to a varnish. O drying, it forms a smooth glossy relatively hard and permanent  film  that  is  thin  but  solid.  These  paints  are  used  both  for  interior  and exterior.

Oil paints -  This  type  of  paint  can be used for almost all surfaces, from wood and masonry to metal fabrics. Oil paints basically consists of two components - a base and a vehicle

## CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD PAINTS

The characteristics of good paint are:

-  It  should  stick  to  the  surface  well  and  should  be  able  to  seal  the  porous plaster.
-  Its consistency should provide easy workability.
-  The thickness of the pint film should be adequate for good protection and décor of surface.
-  The paint film should dry rapidly.
-  The  dry  paint  film  should  be  able  to  with  stand  the  effects  of  adverse weather for long time, without losing the gloss.
-  It should offer resistance o cracking and flaking.
-  It should possess good moisture maintenance.
-  Its colour should not fade with the passage of time.

## WALLPAPER

They  may  be  smooth  or  have  a  textured  surface  effect.  This  may  be  done  by superimposing or interlacing of other substance to give a rough surface, or by clever designing  when  visual  effect  gives  an  apparent  depth  (dimensional  effect).  Smooth finishes are more resistant to dust and dirt than rough ones, but generally stains show more in smooth finishes.

The pattern maybe floral, geometric, abstract, striped, etc. The choice depends on the room's aspect, height, size and use of room. Large patterned papers tend to overpower and tend to make the room appear smaller than it actually is. Wastage is also higher as patterns have to be cut to match each other. In addition to conventional wallpapers, now  many  paper-backed  materials  are  also  available,  e.g.  fabrics,  wood,  veneers, plastic, etc.

## The main types are :

Surface  printed  paper A  pattern  is  applied  to  the  surface  of  the  paper  by  hand printing and machine printing.

Screen-printingA  wide  range  of  colors  and  designs  are  produced  with  usually  a smooth  surface  finish.  The  cost  is  related  to  the  design  and  the  method  of reproduction. The paper is not washable and damp wiping must be undertaken with great care. It can be easily soiled and stained.

Sponge able paper -  They  are  specially  treated  during  manufacturing  to  withstand water. They are similar in all other aspects to surface printed paper.

Washable papers - Similar to surface printed papers, but has a plastic coating giving it good stain resistance and enabling it to withstand washing.

Anaglypta - It's an embossed paper that is relatively inexpensive. Used to cover poor surfaces,  it  is  normally  painted  after  hanging.  Its  stain  resistance  and  wash  ability depends on the type of paint applied.

Lincrusts - A heavily embossed paper that may have a plastic coating, containing a paper backed textured composition and frequently stimulating wood paneling.

Oatmeal papers (wood chip) - Wooden floor or chips are sandwiched between two layers of paper. Its properties are similar to anaglypts paper.

Flock papers - A raised patterned pile is fixed by adhesive to a paper backing. The piles maybe cotton, silk, wool or synthetic. It attracts and holds dust and is expensive. The surface of the paper maybe damp wiped.

Metallic papers - Paper printed with gold or other metallic powder.

Food grain paper - Photographic reproduction of various food grains waxed during manufacture.

Paper backed hessians -  Strands  of  hessians  fixed  to  a  paper  backing  to  give  the appearance of a hessian coverings. It is not washable but surface can be damp wiped. It is easily stained and damaged by abrasion. It's available in large variety of colors.

Paper backed woven grasses - Pieces of grass are fixed by adhesives to a backing of paper or silk.

Paper backed wools - Fine or coarse strands of wool in natural colors or bright dyes are laid in a parallel fashion on a paper backing. They give a warm effect and provide good insulation.

## Advantages of wallpaper:

-  Contribution to décor
-  Ability to cover poor surfaces
-  Insulation

## Disadvantages of wallpaper:

-  Costly
-  Limited use
-  Not abrasive resistant
-  Stains easily
-  Difficult to clean
-  Cannot be easily restored
-  Not very durable

## PVC Cloths

They are woven cotton finished with a layer of PVC, and are used to form decorative panels  on  walls  or  doors.  It  maybe  plain  or  quilted,  involving  the  use  of  a  foam stuffing and fixed by adhesive or metal studs. It produces a luxurious effect, improves sound and thermal insulation but is expensive and difficult to repair satisfactorily.

## Leather wall coverings

They are extremely expensive but very decorative. They maybe padded and studded with  brass  studs.  They  are  usually  not  used  to  cover  the  whole  wall.  It's  effect wherever required can be stimulated with plastics.

## Plastic wall coverings

They are available in large variety. Owing to their abrasion resistance, they are more hard  wearing  and  easily  cleaned  than  any  other  covering.  As  they  are  non-porous, tendency  for  growth  of  moulds  is  higher.  Therefore,  adhesive  should  contain fungicides, or fungicidal wash should be applied on the wall prior to applying the wall covering.

## The various types are:

Paper backed vinyl -  The  vinyl  may  have the appearance of almost any material. E.g. silk, tweed, hessian, cork, grass paper, wood, stone or brick.

Fabric backed vinyl - Similar in appearance to the paper backed ones but is more durable.

Vinyl flock paper- These are velvet piles of flock, mostly synthetic, stuck in patterns over the back ground vinyl wallpaper.

Plastic wall tiles - Imitating ceramic tiles.

Laminated plastic - As a veneer or surface board, melamine is the resin frequently used  during  manufacture  of  these  plastic  laminates  which  may  stimulate  wood paneling. E.g.Formica.

Expanded polyutherene -  It  is  used  in  sheets  or  tiles  on  walls  and  coiling  to  give heat  and  sound  insulation,  and  helps  eliminate  condensation.  It  can  be  painted  with emulsion paint or covered with paper. Spirits dissolves it and hence if oil paint is to be applied on it, it has to be lined with paper and given a coat of emulsion paint to act as a  buffer.  Polyutherene  is  inflammable,  and  hence  it  has  to  be  treated  to  avoid  fire risks.

## FABRIC WALL COVERINGS

It is possible to cover the wall surface with any fabric and its durability will depend on the  type  of  fiber  and  the  weave  used  during  its  manufacture.  Fabrics  used  as  wall coverings can be divided into two categories - Woven fabrics, e.g. hessian (used as wallpaper)

Hangings, e.g. tapestries, oriental carpets, drape. Fabrics chosen should not be liable to sag, buckle or stretch when hung permanently on the wall and should not collect excessive dust or dirt. Wild silk or other beautiful fabric maybe padded for heat and

sound  insulation  but  silks  and  tapestries  are  expensive,  and  thus  found  only  in luxurious  establishments  only.  Hessian,  linen  and  some  acetate  viscose  fabrics  are cheaper  and  used  more  extensively.  Fabrics  are  subject  to  attack  by  moths  and mildew, hence proper proofing should be done.

## WOOD PANELING

Wood  used  for  paneling  are  usually  hard,  well  seasoned  and  of  a  decorative appearance.  Most commonly types used are oak, mahogany, teak, etc. it may cover the  wall  from  corner  to  corner.  It  may  be  solid  or  veneered  and  finished  with  wax polish,  French  polish  or  lacquer.  It  will  last  for  years  with  little  maintenance, providing  precautions  are  taken  in  respect  of  dry  rot  and  rot  worm,  though  initial installing  cost  will  be  high.  Wood  paneling  is  usually  found  in  entrance  halls, staircases, assembly halls, boardrooms and restaurant.

## GLASS WALL COVERING

Glass can be used in the form of decorative tiles, mosaics, bricks or full sheet. Glass bricks allow light to pass through the wall itself. Colored opaque glass sheets or tiles maybe used in bathrooms. Mirror tiles are used to reflect light and to alter the apparent size of the room or corridor. Sometimes antique mirror tiles are used to give a duller surface with lesser reflection. Large uniform mirrors maybe used to cover the whole wall like over a vanity unit or dressing table or on a corridor wall. A glassless mirror is also available which is lighter (almost 1/5 th the weight of the conventional mirror), does  not  form  mist  and  will  not  shatter  if  dropped.  It  consists  of  polyester  film, vacuum coated with aluminum and mounted on a flat frame.

## METAL WALL COVERING

Metals  may  be  used  as  wall  coverings  for  their  hygienic  qualities.  Copper  and anodized aluminum are decorative and maybe used in areas such as bars where metals in  combination  with  rows  of  bottles  and  interesting  lighting  create  an  impressive effect.  Stainless  sleet  is  used  in  tile  form  in  kitchens  where  they  present  a  durable, easily cleaned, hygienic surface. Metal skirting boards cover edges between wall and floor surfaces. Metal foil can be elegantly and sparingly used as a wall covering. Foil is available in variety if colors.

## OTHER MATERIALS

Various flooring materials can also be used as wall coverings. They provide different colors,  patterns  and  texture.  Though  expensive,  they  are  hardwearing  and  abrasion resistant. The various types are: -

-  Linoleum
-  Cork (in tiles or sheets)
-  Carpets
-  Marble
-  Terrazzo
-  Ceramic tiles
-  Granite
-  Bricks  &  stones  (these  can  be  used  for  exterior  wall  and  left unplastered. Also used in fireplaces and chimney breasts to give a Decorative finish.)

## Protection

Life expectancy of a wall covering or finish can be increased and the cost of cleaning, Maintenance and restoration reduced in several ways:

-  Selection of finish should be suitable for the degree of spoilage, abuse and damage expected.

-  Select  a  covering  that  does  not  hold  and  attract  dust,  can  be  easily  cleaned  and restored if damage or stained.
-  Use a more durable and easy to clean and maintain surface for the lower part of the wall.
-  Use plastic sheets on less durable surfaces that are subjected to staining and knock.
-  Use doorstoppers to prevent damage to surfaces behind the door.
-  Use kick plates to protect the lower part of the door.
-  Treat porous surfaces with soil retardant finish.

## 5.5 Floor and Floor Finishes

Floors  are  important  aspect  of  interior  decoration.  Floors  are  both  functional  and decorative and play an important part in the cleaning and maintenance program of any hotel. They cover a large area and are subjected to a great deal of wear and tear. Clean and well-kept floors indicate the standard of cleanliness throughout the establishment. Ease  of  cleaning  in  relation  to  the  type  and  amount  of  soiling  Sound  and  heat insulation Nature and condition of sub floor. Floor surfaces cover a large area of the room  and  are  subjected  to  constant  wear.  They  are  expensive  and  replace  less frequently than other furnishings. Improperly laid floors or damaged floors can cause accidents and damage to the equipment.  Floor surfaces must be comfortable and quiet besides contributing to the décor of the room.  The traffic in the area and utility of the room must also be considered.

## SUB-FLOORS

Floor  surfaces  are  divided  into  two  types  hard  and  soft  floors.   A  sub  floor  is  laid below the floor surface which may be made of soft wood or hard board.  It should be free from dampness, dirt and unevenness. This protects the top floor. In large modern

buildings the subfloor is often made of concrete but in older and smaller buildings it consists of soft wooden boards, nailed to wooden joints.

## SELECTION OF FLOOR FINISHES

Appearance: Colour, pattern and texture of the floor surfaces should be compatible to the  size,  décor  and  activity  of  the  room.  Pale  colours  provide  a  cool  appearance  of warmth. Patterned surfaces add interest to the room.

Comfort: Foot  fatigue  should  be  reduced  by  use  of  soft  resilient  surfaces.   Floor surfaces should not be noisy or slippery.

Durability: Grit, dragging of furniture and placement of equipment or circulation of heavy traffic should not damage the floor surface.  They should also not be affected by the cleaning reagents and food spillages.

## Life Expectancy:

Since floor surfaces are not changed frequently, they are expected to last for longer time.

## Safety:

Safety to the guests and occupants must be considered.  Fire resistance, slip resistance and accident proof surfaces must be selected.

## Ease of Cleaning:

Ease of maintenance and cleaning costs must be considered while selecting them.

Cost: The  cost of floor surface cost of lying and maintenance should be considered before selection.

## Types of Floor Finishes

<!-- image -->

Hard  floor  finishes: Hard  floors  are  usually  sealed  to  give  a  non-absorbent,  semi permanent gloss or finish which will wear off in time. Seal is applied on clean and dry floor. Before re-sealing any remaining seal has to be stripped off. This is done with a chemical stripper, except in the case of wood and cork where sanding is done. In order to  preserve  the  seal,  polish  should  be  applied  to  seal  flooring.  Polishes  are  usually spirit  or  water  based.  Spirit  based  floor  polishes  may  be  paste  or  liquid  and  require buffing when dry to produce a shine. Water based polishes are liquid and dries after application to give a shiny surface.

## NON RESILIENT HARD FLOOR FINISHES

Stone: The  natural  stone  are  available  in  slab  form,  is  usually  cut  in  tiles  from quarried blocks of the stone or rocks. Floors made from marble & granite is expensive and  hard  on  feet.  Provides  beautiful  flooring  material  that  has  a  timeless,  elegant quality.  They  referred  as  hard  floors  because  they  offer  no  resilience,  are  cold underfoot and noisy in comparison to other types of floors. The various types of stone commonly used are: marble, slate, quartzite, sand stone, granite etc.

Concrete: It  is  composed  of  cement  and  sand.  Pigments  may  be  added  to  provide colour.  This floor can withstand large weights but is damaged by acids and alkalis. It is suitable for stores, sub-floors, laundry, staircase etc. Concrete is extremely porous, hard and soiled easily.  A scale may be applied to make it stain resistant.  These floors are suitable in halls, lounges, corridors, and bathrooms and as tabletops.

Granolithic: it is hard floor finish of graded granite chips set in cement. It is used for basement  corridors,  storerooms,  stairways  and  laundry.  The  final  surface  is  hardwearing and its appearance is improved if the surface is polished. It is usually laid in tile form.

Terrazzo: This is also a hard floor finish, consisting of a mixture of marble and other decorative  chipping  set  in  fine  cement  that  can  be  colored.  Marble  is  a  rock (limestone)  mainly  found  in  Italy,  and  maybe  white,  black,  green  or  brown.  When used as flooring it is laid in slabs. Marble is very expensive; terrazzo being only chips of  marble  is  much  cheaper.  To  prevent  slipperiness  self-polishing  emulsions  are applied. Terrazzo is used in foyers, cloakrooms and kitchens.

Ceramics: Ceramic tiles  are  made  of  clay  and  fired  at  high  temperature.   They  are hand  or  machine  made,  glazed  and  unglazed.  Shapes  of  the  tiles  may  be  square, rectangular  or  hexagonal.  Tiles  are  waterproof  and  impervious  to  cleaning  liquid. They are commonly used in bathrooms, kitchens, laundry, canteens, bars etc. These floors are hard, noisy and tire the feet.  Ceramic floors should not be polished since that would make it dangerously slippery.

Glazed ceramic tile Glazed ceramic tiles are made from special ceramic clay in two operations  Biscuits  the  body  of  tile  is  made  and  fired  at  1200  To  1300  c  Glazed Biscuits are then coated with glazed, decorations etc.

Vitrified tile When Special Clay is mixed with quartz and feldspar and burned to very high temperatures. These extra ingredients melt, creating a  glass  element inside the tile. This glass component makes the vitrified files very hard and resistant to any type of  absorption.  This  word  ‗Vitrified  Tiles'  is  simply  a  type  tile  with  very  low  water

absorption.  And  this  property  makes  vitrified  tiles  acid/alkali/chemical  resistant, impairs a greater strength & makes it stain resistant.

Vitrified tile Full body vitrified tiles: This type of vitrified tiles has color all the way throughout  the  body  (thickness)  of  the  tile.  Because  of  this  scratches  are  less noticeable  in  this  type  of  tiles.  Full  body  vitrified  tiles  are  formed  with  the  paint mixture pre-added while making the body. It is called Glazed Vitrified Tiles (GVT). Main advantage with GVT is it offers option of making any type of design/art work that is only possible in this type of vitrified tiles. Much type of textures (like wooden, bamboo slate or stone) are possible in GVT.

## RESILIENT HARD FLOOR FINISHES

Wood: Wood Floors There is nothing quite as attractive as the warmth and richness of wood  floors.  Most  hardwood  floors  are  made  from  oak,  but  other  popular  woods include  ash,  beech,  birch,  hickory,  maple,  teak,  and  walnut.  In  addition  to  its attractiveness, hardwood floors are extremely durable if they are properly finished and maintained.  Unfinished wood floors will quickly deteriorate under even light use, as wood  is  an  extremely  porous  material.  Unfinished  woods  are  susceptible  to  dirt lodging in the grains, splintering of the wood fibers abrasions caused by normal foot traffic,  and  of  course,  moisture,  the  bane  of  wood  floors.  Too  much  moisture  will cause a wood floor to warp, while too little humidity will cause wood floors to shrink and  crack.  To  help  forestall  damage,  most  wood  floors  made  today  receive  factory applied finish. Tung oil and carnauba wax are then applied to seal the wood. Wood Floors  since  there  is  a  degree  of  resiliency  in  even  the  hardest  of  hardwood  floors, precautions should be taken to protect the floor from furniture legs that may dent the flooring. The types of wood flooring are outlined below:

Wood Parquet flooring: It is  a  floor  composed  of  short  strips  or  blocks  of  wood forming a pattern, sometimes with inlays of other woods or other materials. Parquet flooring is a series of wood flooring pieces that create a geometric design.  Parquet offers a variety of design options. Timber used for Parquet floor is Jati & Kempis.

These are made into tiles that can be used to stimulate wood parquet but are generally called ‗parquet' these days even when laid simply to resemble a board floor. Various ready-patterned tiles in herringbone, basket weave or strip are available. Plywood parquet tiles are not durable in areas of heavy wear. It is supplied in various

Plywood: squares from 9inches to 3ft.

Hard wood strips: These are high-quality wood flooring made of hardwoods. A well maintained  hardwood  floor  improves  with  age.  Hardwood  blocks  vary  in  thickness from ¾ inch to 1 ¼ inch and the size may be up to 12 x 3 inches. The strips used are up to 4inches wide and are carved to have a tongue and groove.

Asphalt tiles: they are composed of asbestos fibres, pigments, inert fillers, bound with asphalt in the case of a darker verities and with some other resinous binder in the case of lighter colors.

Bitumastic flooring: This is a joint less, low cost flooring and consist of a type of asphalt roll onto a sold sub floor in a hot plastic state. It is soft in texture, though the appearance is that of a hard floor. It is normally black, brown and red in colour. It is also used in as moisture-proof membrane to protect other flooring against dampness. Howe ever, it is damage by heat and heavy weigh

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

## SEMI HARD FLOOR FINISHES

Linoleum: This is made up of lignum, i.e. flax and ileum in oil. Ground corkwood, linseed oil and resins (gum) are pressed on to jute backing.  This is prepared in sheet or tile form.  Linoleum may crack if laid on poor quality sub floor. It is hard wearing, resilient  and  warm,  but  may  peel,  rot  and  gets  destroyed  by  alkalis. The  thickness varies  from  2mm  to  6mm.  Linoleum  flooring  is  also  available  in  form  of  tiles. Linoleum  flooring  should  be  laid  over  an  effective  damp-proof  area.  Its  properties included in a remarkable degree of resiliency. Next to cork and rubber, and of course, padded  carpeting,  linoleum  is  considered  to  have  the  greatest  degree  of  resiliency. Linoleum was quite durable, was resistant to oil and grease, and do not shrink. The negative aspects of linoleum were that it is highly susceptible to water. The linoleum would absorb water and would then soften, causing it to lose its abrasion resistance and become more susceptible to indentation.

Rubber: Rubber floors are usually made by a combination of natural and synthetic rubber.  They may be laid in sheets or tile form.  They may be coloured and mottled with inlaid patterns.  The floor is hard wearing, resilient, quiet and waterproof.  It is non-slip  and  may  be  grease  resistant.   Damage  may  occur  due  to  alkalis,  acids  and spirits.  One major advantage is that they are quite resilient and will remain resilient over a considerable temperature range. They are not affected by mould, bacteria and pest  infestation.   It  is  commonly  used  in  kitchens,  bathrooms,  health  clubs,  near swimming pools etc. Rubber Floors All modern rubber floors are made from synthetic rubber

such as styrene butadiene rubber (SBR). Rubber tiles are cured or vulcanized by the application  of  heat.  Rubber  floors  are  nonporous,  waterproof  surfaces.  Rubber flooring is susceptible to alkaline, oils, grease, solvents, ultraviolet light, and ozone in the air.

Vinyl Floors: There are several types of vinyl floorings and tiles. The major varieties include  vinyl  composition  tiles,  homogeneous  or  flexible  vinyl  tiles,  and  laminated vinyl flooring. Laminated vinyl flooring is less expensive to manufacture than vinyl composition  or  homogeneous  vinyl  floors.  The  low  initial  cost  may  be  deceiving, however,  for  once  the  top  wear  layer  is  worn  through,  the  floor  will  have  to  be replaced. Some laminated floorings are only guaranteed for three years with moderate use. The cost of laminated vinyl flooring will vary in proportion to the thickness of the top vinyl wear layer. Vinyl Floors In addition to the vinyl resins, vinyl composition tiles  contain  mineral  fillers  such  as  asphalt  and  pigments.  Homogeneous  vinyl  tiles may either be flexible or solid, and it has become the preferred standard for resilient tile  flooring.  It  is  practically  unaffected  by  moisture,  oils,  and  chemical  solvents. Vinyl  is  made  from  asbestos,  fibres,  mineral  pigments  and  PVC.   They  are  very hygienic and deal in hospitals, kitchens, dining area, nurseries, common rooms, lifts etc. They are water and oil resistant and can be made slip resistant.  They are damaged by cleaning gels, high temperature and acids.

Thermoplastic: These  are  made  of  asphalt,  fibres,  mineral  fillers  and  pigments  or synthetic  resins  with  vinyl  binder.   The  tiles  are  usually  dark  coloured  and  quite durable.   They  have  good  thermal  insulation  and  are  resistant  to  water.   They  are damaged by heat, acids and alkalis.  They are useful in canteens, corridors, shops and offices. PVC may be added to make hard thermoplastic more flexible.

Cork: Cork tile is  made from the outer bark of oak trees. The cork is ground into large granules, mixed with synthetic resins, and pressed into sheets, which are then cut into tiles.  Contemporary cork tiles for floors usually have a top layer of clear vinyl applied to them. This vinyl layer protects the cork from staining and wear.  Cork tiles traditionally  have  had  limited  application  in  industrial  or  institutional  settings.  One reason is that cork is susceptible to staining because it is one of the most porous of all floor coverings. Another limitation is that it is not durable; it is highly susceptible to abrasion. Cinders, sand, and gravel tracked on to a cork floor will severely shorten its life span. Finally, it is expensive.

## SOFT FLOOR COVERING

Soft floors are used for variety in colour, texture and design.  They are warm, durable, quiet,  slip  resistant  and  economical.   Various  types  of  colourings  may  be  used  in different areas depending upon cost of maintenance, cost of installation, attractiveness and use.  Soft floor coverings commonly consist of two types: Carpets and Rugs.

Carpets: Carpets are used extensively in hotels and institutional establishment.  The type of carpet selected will depend upon the suitability and traffic in the area.  They may be used in bedrooms, lounges, TV rooms, restaurants, office and corridors.  A good quality carpet should be able to withstand spillages, cigarette ash and grit.  They must also be resilient to heavy furniture.

Rugs and matting: Rugs may be used on floors where wall-to-wall carpeting is not advisable. In heavy traffic areas, rugs can be turned over to neutralize wear and tear. They can be rolled and removed for cleaning and modifications in arrangement.  Rugs may be used to control noise and add colour or pattern to the floor.  They are made of cotton, wool or blended with synthetic material.

Matting is used in corridors, building entrances, around swimming pools and outdoors to prevent heavy soiling and provide noise control in the area coir, cotton and filtered fibres are most common.

## CARPET CONSTRUCTION

Carpets consist of three layers: a pile, a background and an underlay.  The pile is held into the backing with knots and adhesives.

Under lay: The underlay acts as a shock absorber between the backing and the sub floor.  It makes the carpet softer and provides insulation.  Underlay may be made of felt, rubber, foam or jute with polypropylene backing.

Backing: Natural materials like jute, hemp, glue and starch are used along with resin, synthetic rubber and polypropylene to form the backing.  A secondary backing may be added to improve resilience.

Pile: The carpet pile absorbs most of the wear. It is called the face of the carpet; this is the part which is seen on the surface.  It should be strong and resilient, shrink- proof, moth proof and flameproof. The fibre such as wool and cotton, silk is used. The carpet pile  is  generally  made  of  blends  of  fibres.Carpets  can  be  produced  with  several different kinds of pile.

## TYPES OF PILING

Cut Pile: In these types of carpets, the ends are cut on the surface of the carpet. The pile may be short and smooth or long and shaggy.  It may also be cut long and short.

Looped Pile: It is uncut and may be tufted.  It could be shaggy or smooth.

Cut and Looped Pile: This is a combination pile used in pattern carpets.

## TYPES OF CARPET

Woven Carpets: Some of the highest quality carpets are made of weaving method. The pile and backing woven together so they lock into the position. Here, the pile and backing is produced simultaneously.  The pile is secured with a knot and is therefore very  strong.   The  pile  may  be  either  cut  or  uncut.   This  type  of  weave  gives  a sculptured  effect  E.g.  Axminster  carpets,  carpets.  Woven  carpets  are  expensive  but very durable and are used in hotel reception areas, corridors, dining area, bedrooms, lounges etc.

Types of woven carpets: Wilton carpets; they may be produced as patterned, cord, Brussels,  or  plain.  Axminster  carpets;  There  are  three  types  of  Axminster  carpets. They are Spool, gripper, chenille.

Oriental carpets

Wilton carpets

Pattern Wilton Carpets: These are woven on the jacquard looms which draw up one thread at a time to form the pile while the remainder stay hidden in the backing giving strength,  warmth  and  resilience.   Up  to  five  colours  may  be  used  in  the  carpet construction.

Plain Wilton carpets : These are not woven on the jacquard looms only one colour is used, they have extra jute threads called ‗stuffer' added to the backing to compensate for lack of the spare coloured yarn as filling.

Cord : These are plain Wilton carpet with uncut pile.

Brussels: These carpets are patterned Wilton carpets with an uncut pile.

Axminster carpets : this carpets are woven in such a way that the pile is entirely on the surface. The pile is longer and less close than Wilton carpets. They are of three types.

Spool Axminster :  this is the most popular Axminster carpets and a single piece can have an unlimited numbers of colours in the pattern. The carpet is woven in such a manner that the pattern is visible o both the side.

Gripper Axminster ;  Same as spool Axminster carpets but the difference being the maximum eight colours only.

Chenille Axminster carpets: In French Chenille refers to a -caterpillar‖. The carpet is soft and thick, giving a pile a segment look like a caterpillar.

## Hand Made Carpets/ Oriental carpets

These are traditional carpets, backed by centuries of excellence in manufacture.  They are functional as well as aesthetic.  They have a long life, durability and richness of weave and design.  They are made by knotting pieces of yarn on to a backing weave.

## NON WOVEN CARPET

Tufted Carpets: These are cheaper than woven carpets and forms 50% of the carpets produced.  These are made by inserting tufts into a backing and securing with latex. The pile is looped, cut or combination.  The carpet manufactured by this technique is very fast and comes in various dimensions.  They are commonly used in hotels and institutions.   Care  is  necessary  to  prevent  over  wetting  which  may  damage  the adhesive.

Needle  Loom: These  carpets  have  no  pile  but  are  made  by  needle  punching  and entangling  a  mixture  of  fibres  through  a  backing  fabric  and  coating  it  with  resin. Nylon, jute and polypropylene are used.  Heat may be applied to fix the fibres.

Bonded Pile: In this type of carpet, the pile is compacted and bonded to an adhesive backing.   Shortcut  pile,  loops,  cords  or  electrostatic  flocking  may  be  used. Application of heat causes firm bonding.

Electro statically flocked carpets: Bonding is also used for flocked carpets, which have  thousands  of  small  fibres  electro  statically  bonded  to  an  adhesive-coated backing.

Knitted  Carpets: these  carpets  are  produced  by  interlacing  yarns  I  the  series  of connected  loops.  As  in  woven  carpets,  the  pile  and  backing  are  produced simultaneously. Multiple sets of needles interlace the pile, backing and stitching yarns together in one operation.

Laying of carpets: Carpets in hotels and institutions are fitted from wall to wall and along the skirting.  The carpets may be fixed by using glue or narrow strips of wood, which are tacked to the wall or sunken into a recessed area in the floor carpets along staircases must be fixed permanently with metal tacks to prevent accidents.  Special treatments  like  flame  proofing,  moth  proofing,  water  resistance  and  anti  static treatment may be given to carpets to improve their function of durability and ease of maintenance.  Disinfectant solutions may be also added in carpet treatment.

Care and maintenance: Carpets are easily soiled and damaged. They require regular and frequent care.  Daily attention must be provided to remove stains and dirt from carpets.   Dust,  dirt,  grit,  organic  substances  and  cigarette  ash  may  cause  damage. Furniture indentation and cigarette ash, residue shampoo and pests may damage the pile.  Spot cleaning of stains immediately is essential to prevent penetration and built up stains.  Dry suction, vacuum cleaning must be done every day to remove surface dust and grit.  Scraps of paper, pins  and other wastes must be brushed away before vacuuming.  Shampooing of carpets is essential periodically.  The frequency depends upon the type of traffic and nature of carpets.   Most housekeeping departments may call  for  contract  cleaning.   Carpets  must  be  tested  before  shampooing.   Hand shampooing  is  very  tiresome  and  ineffective.   It  is  suitable  for  corners  and  stairs. Liquid or dry foam shampoo may be used.  This traps the dirt and loosens it from the pile.   Special  brushes  help  to  clean  from  the  pile. Special  brushes  help  to  clean  the pile.  Spot cleaning of stains using apt reagents may be necessary before shampooing. Use  diluted  agents  to  prevent  damage.   Freshly  spilt  liquids  can  be  absorbed  or squirted with a soda siphon.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Shampooing: Carpet shampoo machine use one of the two types of shampoos: liquid ad dry foam. Shampoos are anionic synthetic detergents and should be diluted in the correct measures for optimal performance. Liquid shampoos produce very little foam but tend to leave a residue that traps dirt, making it necessary to shampoo the carpet frequently. Dry-foam shampoos are actually also liquids, but they leave dry foam on the surface of the carpet after application- hence the name. The foam loosens and lifts out the dirt, holding it on the surface of the carpet pile until it can be removed by dry section. Dry-foam shampoos contain some solvent in addition to the detergent to assist in  the  removal  of  solvent-soluble  dirt.  Carpets  cleaned  with  a  dry-foam  shampoo require less drying time as well. Carpet shampoo machines are used to dispense both types f shampoos. A cylindrical brush woks the foam into the pile of the carpet.

Hot-water extraction this  is  done  by  a  hot-water  extraction  machine. The machine uses  a  shampoo  solution  that  does  not  form  foam  It  injects  the  solution  under  high pressure through the pile to the back of the carpet, where it emulsifies and looses dirt and  grease.  Simultaneously,  the  machine  sucks  up  the  solution  along  with  the  now suspended dirt and grease. The use of a wet-suction machine after shampooing greatly accelerates the drying time. The dirty solution is deposited into a tank, from which it is  discarded  later.  After  the  cleaning  process,  the  carpet  is  left  slightly  damp  and requires a very short drying time.

Dry  powdering In  this  method,  a  powder  containing  absorbents  such  as  sawdust, solvent and drying agents is sprinkled on the carpet and left or several minutes. The powder  absorbs  the  grease  and  dirt  and  is  removed  with  the  help  of  a  dry-suction cleaner. Waterborne dirt is removed by use of such a powder, therefore this method is not very efficient. The method cannot be strictly considered a deep-cleaning method in fact and should be used only in conjunction with the other carpet-cleaning methods.

## 5.6 Fibers and Fabrics

The word textile is derived from the Latin term -texture‖ for woven fabrics. Thus by textiles  we  understand  those  objects  which  have  been  prepared  by  weaving.  Textile has an important bearing on our daily lives and everyone needs to know about textiles as we use them in some way or the other. To understand about textiles the study of textiles will help to a great extent when we buy textile materials this knowledge will prevent  us  from  making  mistakes  and  we  will  be  able  to  purchase  good  quality materials. There is a growing demand for textiles and clothing by people of all walks of life.

Yarns are produced by twisting or spinning of the textile fibres and in turn fabric is a structure produced by interlacing or interloping of the yarns. There are certain terms which are used very often in the study of textiles that are to be understood first. Most of the fabrics we use for various purposes are woven that means they are constructed by interlacing sets of yarns that run along lengthwise and crosswise directions. Each yarn is made up of several fibres therefore it is essential to know or to define the terms like fibre, yarns and fabrics.

A -fibre -is defined as any product capable of being woven or otherwise made into fabric.  It  is  smallest  visible  unit  of  textile  product.  A  fibre  can  be  defined  as  a -pliable‖ hair like strand that is very small in diameter in relation to its length‖. Fibres are the fundamental units or the building blocks used in the making of textile yarns and  fabrics.  Thus  fibres  are  the  essential  components  and  basic  units  and  are  an essential component for making yarns. These fibres are of many types.

Fig5.2 Classification of textile fibres

<!-- image -->

According  to  the  source  from  which  textile  fibres  are  obtained  fibres  are  broadly classified into two ways.

- I. Source base classification
- II. Length base classification

## SOURCE BASE CLASSIFICATION

Vegetable  fibres  or  cellulosic  fibres: The  fibres  that  are  derived  from  plants  are called vegetable fibres. The basic material of all plant life is cellulose. These cellulose fibres  have  certain  common  properties  like  low  resilience,  high  density,  and  good conductor of  heat.  They  are  highly  absorbent  and  are  resistant  to  high  temperature. Cotton  flax,  jute,  ramie  are  some  of  the  examples  of  vegetable  fibres.  E.g.  Cotton, Linen, Kapok, Jute and Hemp

Animal fibres: The fibres which are obtained from animals are called animal fibres. Wool and silk are common examples of animal fibres. They are made up of protein molecules. Animal fibres have high resiliency but weak when wet because they are bad conductors of heat. E.g. Silk, wool

Mineral fibres: They are the inorganic materials shaped in to fibres and are mainly used in the fire proof fabrics. Asbestos is the example of mineral fibre. Mineral fibres are fire proof, resistant to acids and are used for industrial purposes E.g. Asbestos

Man made fibres: These refer to those fibres that are not naturally present in nature and are made artificially by man. Man made fibres have high strength, strong when wet low moisture absorption characteristics. Examples of manmade fibres are viscose rayon,  acetate  rayon,  nylon,  polyester  etc.  Depending  on  raw  material  chosen  for making of the fibres they are classified as cellulosic fibres, protein fibres and synthetic fibres.

Regenerated fibres -  These  fibres  are  made  from  extremely  small  cotton  fibres  or any  other  fibre  source  such  as  wood  pulp,  milk  protein,  etc.  Chemicals  are  used  to dissolve these and the solution is then converted into solid fibres. Examples are rayon (cellulose out of viscose/acetate/triacetate) of different types, casein fibre (from milk) and soya bean fibre.

Synthetic  fibres -  These  are  made  using  various  petrochemical  products.  Nylon, acrylic and polyester are all synthetic fibres. It is advisable to use garments made of natural fibres which are eco-friendly in nature. Sometimes synthetic fibres may cause allergies if worn next to skin. Sources of commonly used natural and manmade fibres are presented

Metallic fibresThese are produced from metals such as gold, silver, and aluminum obtained by mining and refining.

## LENGTH BASE CLASSIFICATION

Staple Fibres: Natural or manmade or short length fibres which measures in inches or fraction of inch example 3/4 inch to 18 inches except silk all other natural fibres are staple fibres. Staple fibres are of limited length.

Filament: Long continuous fibres strands of indefinite length measured  in  yards or meters fibres of continuous length long enough to be used in fabric as such Natural

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

silk  filament  is  360-1200 meters. Synthetic filaments can be made many kilometers long. The only natural fibre available is silk.

## GENERAL PROPERTIES OF TEXTILE FIBRES

Texture: It  is  the  tactile  sensation  experienced  when hand is passed over a surface. Staple  fibres  and  fabrics  made  from  staple  are  lightly  rough  while  filaments  and fabrics made from filaments fibres are smooth.

Resilience: It  means  that  when  fibre  is  compressed  and  later  when  the  pressure  is released. It will tend to return to its original shape. Resistance to compression varies from  fibre  to  fibre.  This  quality  causes  the  fabric  to  be  wrinkle  resistant  with  the resistance varying according to the degree of elasticity inherent in the fibre. Wool has outstanding resiliency while it is poor in cotton.

Luster: It is seen when light reflected from a surface. It is more subdued than shine. Silk and synthetics have luster than cellulosic fibres. In fact synthetics have high luster which is purposefully removed during spinning.

Static Electricity: It is generated by the friction of a fabric when it is rubbed against itself or other objects. If the electrical charge that is not conducted away, it tends to build  up  on  the  surface  and  when  fabric  comes  in  contact  with  a  good  conductor  a shock or transfer occurs. This transfer may sometimes produce sparks. This is more feel during hot and humid conditions.

Crimp: Wool fibre is more or less wavy and has twists. This waviness is termed as crimp . Finer the wool more will be the crimps in it. Marino wool will have 30 crimps per inch while coarse wool has only one or two. This property of having crimps gives elasticity to the fibre.

Elasticity: It  is  the  ability  of  stretched  material  to  return immediately to  its original size.

Difference between cellulose and synthetic fibres: Among natural fibres available cotton, wool and silk are the most commonly used fibres for making fabrics. Among artificial  fibres  rayon,  nylon  and  polyester  are  popular.  The  following  are  5+the differences  between  vegetable  fibres  and  synthetic  fibres.

|    5 | Cellulosic  fibres  have  high  affinity for dyes.                                                                                                              | Identification:  Readily  burns  and  melts  giving  a  distinct  plastic  burning                                                        |
|    6 | Cellulosic fibres are resistant to  moth  but  less  susceptible  to  mildew  hence  damp  clothes  should not be stored.                                       | Highly  resistant  to  moths,  mildew and insects.                                                                                        |
|    7 | Cellulosic  fibres  need  ironing  at low temperatures .E.g.: wool                                                                                              | Synthetic  fibres  are  adjusted  with  high  heat  settings. Hence  it  is  good  for  embossed  designing  and  easy  for               |
|    8 | Susceptible  to  strong  mineral  and  organic  acids  stains  that  require  acid  treatment  should  be rapidly removed.                                      | Synthetic  fibres  are  adjusted  with  high  heat  settings.  Hence  it  is  good  for  embossed  designing  and easy for plant setting. |

## IDENTIFICATION OF FIBRE THROUGH NON-TECHNICAL TEST

Identification of fibres by visual test and feel of the fabric: By now, you know the names  and  some  basic  properties  of  fibres  obtained  from  different  sources.  On  the basis  of  this  knowledge  can  you  identify  the  fabric  you  are  buying?  Yes,  to  some extent you can. If you remember the characteristics of a fibre then you will also know the  properties  of  the  fabric  made  out  of  it  because  the  fabric  will  have  the  same properties.  Look  for  these  properties  in  the  fabric  and  add  to  this  your  personal experiences like touch, feel and visual inspection of the fabric. Chances are that you will be able to name the fabric. In the follow we are presenting to you some of the typical characteristics of different fabrics. If you examine visually, these will help you to recognize the fabric/ fibres.

Identification  of  fibres  using  burning  test: Burning  test  tells  us  about  the composition of fibres. i.e., whether the fibres of a fabric are from a plant and animal source or are man-made. Follow the steps mentioned below to conduct the burning test: Take out a few strands of fibres from a yarn or a fabric and then burn them with the help of a candle flame or a match stick. Observe the following points and record your observations:

The behavior of the fibres on approaching the flame, in the flame, on burning, and the residue left after burning. Since different types of fibres have specific burning pattern, one can recognize them accordingly.

| Fibre                                                     | Near flame          | Near flame   | Type  of  burning/flame  Odour  burning   | Type  of  burning/flame  Odour  burning   | of                                      | Residue                                                        | Residue   |

## VEGETABLE FIBRES OR CELLULOSIC FIBRES

Cotton: Cotton is obtained plant source and it is classified as a natural material as it is obtained from the seeds of cellulose seed fibre staple fibre measuring 10- 65mm in length  and  white  to  beige  in  color  in  its  natural  state.  It  is  composed  basically  of  a substance called cellulose. As cotton occupies 50% of the consumption of fibres by weight in the world it is called as the king of all fibres. Cotton is the fabric for every home and is the most widely produced of textile fabrics today. It has now been proved that India was the first country to manufacture cotton. Among the recent findings at Mohenjo-Daro  were  a  few  scrapes  of  cotton  sticking  to  the  side  of  a  slivers  vase. Cotton is the white downy covering of the seed grown in the pods. The cotton plant grown in the tropics needs a climate with 6 months of summer weather to blossom and produce pods. The cotton fibre is the shortest of all the textile fibres. Its length varies from 8/10 of an inch to 2 inches. Cotton with short length fibres is technically known as -short staple‖. The one with the long fibres is called -long staple‖ and it more used since it is used for making fine qualities of cloth. Long staple is especially suitable as it  is  easy  to  spin  and  produces  a  strong  smooth  yarn.  It  is  also  suitable  for mercerization a finishing process used to improve the absorbency, strength and luster of fibre.

## PREPARATION:

Ginning: The  fibres  are  first  removed  from  seeds  in  a  gin.  This  process  is  called ginning. Every bit of the cotton fibre is  used in  the manufacture. The fibre mass is then compressed into bales and shipped into spinning mills. The short ends left on the seeds after the longer fabric. Fibres have been removed are used in the production of rayon,  plastics,  dynamite  and  many  other  by  products,  which  are  then  used  in  the production of seed oil, hydrogenated fats, soaps and cosmetics.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Forming the laps : In the step dirt from cotton fibre is removed and fibres are made in to a soft roll or lap. Then several laps are combined into one.

Carding: These fibres are drawn together to form a loose rope called sliver.

Doubling : Slivers are combined here for uniformity.

Combing: This process is continuation and refinement of carding process. All cotton yarns for fabrics are carded but not all are combed. Yarns that are combed are finer even and free from all woody stalk of the plant. They are used for finer quality fabrics such as voile and organdie. Fabrics made from these fabrics are expensive too. The slivers are called carded slivers.

Drawing : The sliver is then combined, smoothened and stretched. The slivers may be drawn reduced further in size and given a slight twist by a process called roving in which the slivers is passed through rollers and wound on to bobbins set into spindles. It is done in a speed frame.

Roving: The  bobbins  are  placed  on  the  roving  frame  where  further  drawing  and twisting takes place until the cotton stock is about a pencil lead in diameter.

Spinning :  Done  on  the spinning  frame  where  the  stock  passes  through  sets  of  high speed rollers and gives the yarn of desired thickness.

Weaving and dying: The yarn is then knitted or woven in any one of the variety of weaves and structures. Warp yarns are usually more strongly twisted than filling yarns since they must withstand greater strain in weaving and finishing. Dye stuffs may be applied to raw cotton, yarn or piece goods.

Finishing : It  includes  starching,  calendaring,  sanforizing,  mercerizing  or  other finishes as it is necessary for the particulars use for which the cloth is intended. These finishes may be applied to yarns but are usually applied to fabric. The fabrics may be given these special finishes before or after dyeing.

## CHARACTERISTIC OF COTTON

Structure : The cotton fibre is short (1/2 inch -2 long inch) and cylindrical or tubular as  it  grows.  The  cotton  fibre  is  essentially  cellulose  consisting  of  carbon,  hydrogen and oxygen. Bleached cotton is almost pure cellulose raw cotton contains about 5% of impurities.

Strength :  Cotton fibre is relatively strong which is due to the intricate structure and 70% crystalline.

Elasticity: Cotton is relatively inelastic because of its crystalline polymer system and for this reason cotton textile wrinkle and crease readily.

Hygroscopic  moisture :  Cotton  does  not  hold  moisture  so  well  as  wool  or  silk  but absorbs it and so feels damp much more quickly. It also rapidly spreads throughout the material.

Electrical  property : The  hygroscopic  nature  ordinarily  prevents  cotton  textile materials from developing static electricity.

Absorbency : As cotton has cellulose it is a good absorbent of fibre.

## Thermal properties

Cotton fibres have the ability to conduct heat energy, minimizing any destructive heat accumulation thus they can withstand hot ironing temperature.

Drape ability :  Cotton does not have good body to drape well in shape. The type of construction of the fabric may improve this property.

Resilience: Cotton  wrinkles  easily  some  wrinkle  resistant  finishes  may  reduce  this property.

Luster :  The  natural  cotton  has  no  pronounced  luster.  This  can  be  improved  by  the mercerization

finish of the cotton (that is sodium hydroxide treatment).

Shrinkage: The fibre itself does not shrink but cotton fibre which has been stretched in the finishing process tends to relax back creating shrinkage.

Heat conductivity: Cotton is the better conductor of heat than wool or silk but not as good as rayon.

## Action of acids and alkalis

Strong acids will destroy the fibres immediately. Dilute inorganic acids will weaken the  fibre  and  if  left  dry  will  rot  it.  Therefore  after  treatment  with  acidic  solutions cotton articles should be thoroughly rinsed in water. They are affected very little by organic acids. They are also quite resistant to alkalis even to strong caustic alkalis at high  temperature  and  pressure.  In  8%  NaOH  cotton  fibres  swells,  spirals,  twisted uncoil and shrink and become thicker. The resultant fibre is smoother, lustrous, and stronger and has increased water and dye absorption.

Effect of bleaching : These have no effects until used in uncontrolled conditions and with heat.

Affinity to dyes: Cotton takes in dyes better than linen but not as readily as silk and wool.  If  a  mordant  is  used  cotton  is  easy  enough  to  dye  mordant  colors,  direct  or substantive dyes should be applied to the cotton.

## FABRICS IN COTTON

Flannelette and flannel: A soft napped cotton fabric its warmth in wear is due to the fact  that  the  nap  traps  a  layer  of  air  between  the  body  and  the  cold  outside.  In composition it is the same as ordinary cotton, but treatment in weaving makes it very inflammable.  For  this  reason  attempts  have  been  made  to  make  it  fireproof  by saturating the fibre with metallic salt, but in general fire proofing does not withstand washing.

Organdie: A thin light fabric in plain weave with a very stiff finish. It is made from good quality combed yarn. The yarn is made from long staple cotton and is spun is

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

with  many  twists.  This  along  with  the  finishing  process  produces  its  characteristic transparent  crispness.  The  aim  is  to  give  a  permanent  finish.  The  fabric  is  used  for summer and evening wear.

Muslin: This is a cool, very light, and plain weave cloth also used for summer wear. The  name  derives  from  the  city  of  Mosul  where  the  fabric  was  first  made  muslins wear not always plain, silk and even gold stripes woven in when made in Mosul but as cotton was grown more plentifully and the women could spin yarns of great fineness, cotton yarns gradually super seeded silk.

## Finishes for cotton

The  resin  and  the  non  resin  finishes  give  the  cotton  some  easy  and  minimum  care features  of  as  synthetics.  Advances  in  anti  bacterial  mildew  resistant  and  flame resistant treatments have improved the effectiveness of the performances of cotton in various  end  uses.  Regular  finishes  like  singeing  for  smoothness  mercerization  for strength,  luster  and  affinity  for  dyes,  sizing  and  calendaring  for  luster,  maximum stiffness  body  and  smoothness.  Special  finish  like  sanforizing  for  maximum  pre shrinking,  crease  resistant,  anti  bacterial  finishes,  mildew  and  rot  treatment  napping for softness, warmth, absorbency and moth repellent treatment are common.

## Fibre Blends

Among  the  various  types  of  blends  available  in  market  today  polyester,  cotton terycotton, silk, linen cotton, viscose rayon and cotton and nylon.

## Reasons of blending are:

To facilitate processing.

To improve properties like dimensional stability.

To produce better performance.

To improve texture, hand or feel appearance of fabrics.

To produce multi color fabrics.

To reduce cost.

## CONSUMER DEMAND FOR COTTON

Versatility: Cotton  can  serve  for  food  (cotton  seed  products)  for  clothing  and  for shelter. Cotton fibre can be spun alone or it can be blended with  other textile fibres such  as  linen,  wool,  silk,  viscose  rayon,  polyester,  nylon.  It  serves  the  purpose  of clothing  or  apparel,  home  furnishing  and  industrial  fabrics  by  giving  comfort, durability, fashion and ease for care etc.

Durability: Due  to  natural  twist  cotton  spins  so  well  that  it  can  be  twisted  very tightly. Hence tightly twisted yarns produce durable fabrics.

Comfort: Cotton  conducts  heat  away  from  the  body  and  allows  the  cooler temperature outside to reach the body, so it is a cool material for summer or tropical wear. Knitted cotton is used as comfortable wear.

Fashion  rightness :  Fashion  designers  of  various  countries  have  considered  cotton glamorous enough to include in their collections.

Ease of care :  The factors of light, laundering, ironing and perspiration are common consideration in color fastness to cotton.

Economy  or  price :  Cotton  materials  are  flexible  to  fit  into  all  types  of  economic group. By products of cotton are used for many purposes.

## MAJOR USES

Cotton  is  used  for  home  furnishing: Towels  are  most  common  as  it  is  high  in absorbency, wide range of colors, wash ability and durability. Sheets and pillow cases are mostly blends of cotton with polyester or made of pure cotton. Drapes, curtains and  upholstery  fabrics  are  made  of  cotton  and  its  blends.  Since  cotton  can  be autoclaved at high temperatures, absorbency, wash ability and low static build up are important factors for use of cotton in hospitals. Industrial uses include book bindings, luggage and hand bags, shoes and, slippers, tobacco cloth, woven wiping cloths as and wall covering fabrics.

Wide range of wearing apparels: blouses, shirts, dresses, children wear, active wear, separates  swimwear,  suits,  jackets,  skirts,  pants,  sweaters,  hosiery,  bedspreads, comforters, throws, sheets, towels, table cloths, table mats, napkins.

Linen: Elegant,  beautiful,  durable,  the  refined  luxury  fabric.  Linen  is  the strongest of the vegetable fibers and has 2 to 3 times the strength of cotton. Linen  table  cloths  and  napkins  have  been  handed  down  generation  to generation. Not only is the linen fiber strong, it is smooth, making the finished fabric lint free.

Linen is from flax, a bust fiber taken from the stalk of the plant. The luster is from  the  natural  wax  content.  Creamy  white  to  light  tan,  this  fiber  can  be easily  dyed  and  the  color  does  not  fade  when  washed.  Linen  does  wrinkle easily  but  also  presses  easily.  Linen,  like  cotton,  can  also  be  boiled  without damaging the fiber.

Highly absorbent and a good conductor of heat, this fabric is cool in garments. However, constant creasing in the same place in sharp folds will tend to break the linen threads. This wear can show up in collars, hems, and any area that is iron  creased  during  the  laundering.  Linen  has  poor  elasticity  and  does  not spring back readily.

Manufacturing  of  linen: Linen  is  yarn,  and  fabric  made  from  flax  fibres.  Before linen  can  be  produced,  the  fibre  has  to  be  first  removed  from  the  flax  plant.  Linen manufacturing is a complicated and lengthy process which requires great skill at each stage of production:

-  Cultivating Flax
-  Rippling & Retting
-  Scutching & Hackling
-  Spinning

Cultivating Flax: Linen is a natural yarn or fabric which comes from the fibres of the stalk of the flax plant. To get the most from the fibre, the textile flax is not cut, but pulled from the ground to preserve the long, full length of the fibres which run the entire length of the plant (80/120cm). After this the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and is then retted.

Rippling: This is where the seeds are taken off the plant. Rippling involved combing the seeds off with a coarse comb.

Retting: The flax fibres are held together in the stems by woody material and cellular tissue, and retting is where the deseeded crop of flax straw is subjected to a controlled chemical or biological treatment to make the fibre bundles are easier to separate from the woody part of the stem. Flax can be:

Water-retted : Water-retting is where the flax plants after pulling are tied up in sheaves and put in special dams or ponds for one to two weeks. This method can cause pollution. Today this method is seldom used in Europe, and water retting is more normally carried out in controlled conditions in tanks.

Dew-retted :  dew-retting the flax straw is spread on the ground after pulling and left in the fields for 2 to 8 weeks, depending on the weather. This is the most common method in Western Europe, and is less expensive than waterretting in tanks.

Wooden vat retting : the stems are steeped in water at a temperature of 70 to 90 in a vat until the stem got soft. The stem than removed from the water, and to loosen the stalk the fibre are passed through rollers by a method known as Pownall process.

Breaking  and  Scutching :  This  is  a  mechanical  operation  which,  by  breaking  and beating  the  flax  straw,  separates  the  textile  fibres  in  the  stem  of  the  plant  from  the woody matter which is then used for the manufacture of chipboard. No part of the flax plant is wasted. Fibres are then hackled (combed) to separate long line and short tow fibres.

Hackling: Line fibres then go through a process where they are drafted and doubled, until a rove (a slightly twisted sliver of flax fibre) has been formed. They then undergo the wet spinning process. Line fibres produce fine, strong yarn. Short tow fibres are dry spun and a heavy, coarse yarn results, ideal for use as furnishing fabrics, heavier apparel and knitwear

Spinning: This rove is then spun into a yarn but during this process it is soaked in warm water, which softens the natural gummy substances contained in the yarn and permits the individual fibrils within each fibre to slide in relation to each other, thus producing a very fine and regular yarn. This is called "wet spinning".

## CHARACTERISTICS OF LINEN

Physical properties of linen fibers are given below:

Tensile Strength: Linen is a strong fiber. It has a tenacity of 5.5 to 6.5 gm/den. The strength is

Moisture Regain (MR %): Standard moisture regain is 10 to 12%.

Effect  of  Heat: Linen  has  an  excellent  resistance  to  degradation  by  heat.  It  is  less affected than cotton fiber by the heat.

Effect of Acids: Linen fiber is damaged by highly densified acids but low dense acids does not affect if it is wash instantly after application of acids.

Effects of Alkalis : Linen has an excellent resistance to alkalis. It does not affected by the strong alkalis.

Effects of Bleaching Agents: Cool chlorine and hypo-chlorine bleaching agent does not affect the linen fiber properties.

Effect  of  Organic  Solvent: Linen  fiber  has  high  resistance  to  normal  cleaning solvents.

Dyes: It is not suitable to dye. But it can be dye by direct and vat dyes.

## MAJOR USES

Apparel: Dresses, suits, separates, skirts, jackets, pants, blouses, shirts, children's

wear etc.

Home  Fashion: Curtains, draperies, upholstery, bedspreads, table  linens, sheets, dish towels etc.

## ANIMAL FIBRES

SILK: Silk is considered as -Queen of all textile fibres‖ as it has beauty and elegance and good properties of performance. Silk is the natural protein fiber obtained from silk worm  cocoons.  Japan  is  known  for  producing  best  variety  of  silk.  India  produces different  varieties  of  silk  and  is  famous  for  hand  woven  silk  textiles.  There  is  a tremendous silk production increase in recent years. The production of silk is called Sericulture.  To  obtain  quality  and  quantity  of  silk  rearing  conditions  are  controlled carefully throughout the life cycle of silk moth. These are two types of silk mulberry or cultivated silk and wild silk. Cultivated silk is creamy silk white or yellowish white in  color.  White  wild  silk  color  range  from  brownish  to  golden  yellow  in  color. Sericulture or silk production has a long and colorful history unknown to most.

## MANUFACTURING OF SILK

Rearing  of  silk-worm :  Silk  worms  feed  on  mulberry  tree  leaves  and  therefore  for rearing them, the growing of mulberry trees is the first essential step. These are grown by  the  agriculturists.  Silk  worms  have  a  short  life  of  only  about  two  months  and during which these pass through the following four stages1. Egg 2.worm or larvae 3. Pupa and 4. moths. Silk worms are made to lay eggs on specially prepared paper for this purpose. The eggs can be stored in cold storage for six weeks. Eggs are collected and  kept  at  low  temperature  until  they  are  hatched.  Eggs  take  ten  days  to  hatch Emerged caterpillars of ant head size are fed on fresh mulberry leaves. At this stage the  worm  needs  special  care  bamboo  trays  with  straw  mats  are  provided  for  them. When the  caterpillar  is  about  eight  weeks  old  it  secretes  a  viscous  fluid  from  two glands on its head which oozes out from the common opening near its mouth. The fluid is called ‗fibroin'. At the same time it also secretes a gummy kind of fluid called ‗sericin'  which  passes  through  the  same  opening.  The  fibroin  gets  hardened  when

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

exposed  to  air.  The  silk  worm  spins  around  itself  to  form  a  cocoon.  The  cocoon contains 2000 to 4000 yards of reel able silk. For separating the silk thread from the cocoons they are immersed in hot water. This immersion also kills the warm inside. Then the cocoons are dries and stored.

Reeling: The process of unwinding the filament from the cocoon is called reeling. The care and skill in the reeling operation prevents defects in the raw silk. As the filament of single cocoon is too fine for commercial use, three to ten strands are usually reeled at a time to produce the desired diameter of raw silk thread.

Throwing: As the fibres are combined and pulled on to the reel, twist can be inserted to  hold  the  filaments  together.  This  is  called  as  throwing  and  the  resulting  yarn  is ‗thrown yarn'. This yarn later goes to weaving or knitting industry based the type of yarn produced.

Spinning: Short ends of silk fibres from the outer and inner edges of the cocoons and from broken cocoons and spun into yarns in a manner similar to that used for cotton. This is called spun silk.

Degumming: Sericin or gum up to 30% of the weight of the silk fibre. It is not usually removed until after the cloth is woven because serves as warp sizing that protects the yarns  from  mechanical  injury  during  weaving.  Sericin  remains  on  the  fibre  during reeling  and  throwing  before  finishing,  the  gum  is  removed  by  boiling  the  fabric  in soap and water. The presence of gum and sericin increases the tendency for the silk to water spots on fabrics when ironed.

Bleaching: Silk thread is treated with hydrogen peroxide.

Finishing: Silk  fabrics  require  very  few  finishes  because  they  have  natural  luster, softness and drapability.

Weighting of silk: When silk is boiled to remove the excess of natural gum or sericin it looses weight. This loss of weight is replaced through treatment by metals like tin, aluminum etc in water solutions. These are not removed by washing. Weighted silk is not durable because sunlight and perspiration weakens fibres. Heavy weighting causes silk to crack.

## VARIOUS TYPES OF SILK

Wild silk: Silk produced by moths of species other than bombyx mori. It is brown in color more uneven and coarser. It is usually called Tussar silk.

Waste silk or silk noil: Short ends of spun yarns or in blends with cotton or wool. Sometimes it is called waste silk.

Dupion: Silk yarns made from two cocoons that have been formed in an interlocked manner. The yarn is uneven, irregular and large than regular filaments. It is used in making shantung and duppioni.

Raw silk: Silk that has not had any degumming.

Spun silk: Yarns made from short fibres from pierced cocoons and short ends and outside and inside the edges of cocoons.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF SILK

Strength: Silk is the strongest natural fibre. It has a tenacity of 2.4 to 5.1 grams per denier. More over smoothness of the silk filament yarn reduces the problem of wear from abrasion. The strength of the spun silk yarns depends on the length of silk staple.

Shape  and  appearance: Silk  filaments  are  very  fine  and  long.  They  frequently measure about 1000 to 1300 yards in length. The width of the silk is from 9 to 11 microns.

Elasticity: It is an elastic fibre and its elasticity varies as it is natural fibre. Silk fibre may  be  stretched  from  1/7  to  1/5  its  original  length  before  breaking.  Cultivated degummed  silk  viewed  longitudinally  under  a  microscopic,  resembles  a  smooth transparent rod under microscope. Silk in the gum has rough irregular surface.

Resilience: Silk  retains  the  shape  and  resists  wrinkling  rather  well.  This  is  more  in fabrics made from pure silk rather than spun silk or weighted silk.

Drapability: Silk  has  a  pliability  and  suppleness'  that  aided  by  its  elasticity  and resilience gives it excellent drapability.

Heat  conductivity: Since  silk  is  a  protein  fibre.  It  is  a  non  conductor  of  heat  like wool. Hence it is used for winter apparel.

Absorbency: The  good  absorptive  property  of  silk  also  contributes  to  its  effect  in warmer atmosphere. Silk generally absorbs about 11% of its weight in moisture which makes silk for easy dying and printing.

Shrinkage: Due to the filament in length, smooth surface silk have normal shrinkage which can be easily restored by ironing at moderate heat and damp conditions.

Resistance  to  mildew: Silk  will  not  be  affected  by  mildew  unless  left  for  time  in damp state or under extreme conditions of tropical dampness.

Reaction to alkalis: Silk is not as sensitive as wool to alkalis. It may be affected in concentrations  and  high  temperatures.  Cold  concentrated  solutions  of  alkali  such  as soda or caustic potash has slight action on silk. Heated solution dissolved silk.

Reaction  to  acids: acids do not harm them while medium concentrated HCL will dissolve silk.

Affinity  for  dyes: unsatisfactory.

Concentrated  mineral  acids  dissolve  faster  than  wool.  Organic Silk  has  very  good  affinity  for  acid  dyes  but  light  fastness  is

Reaction  to  bleach: Strong  bleaches  contain  sodium  hypochlorite  will  deteriorate silk.  Mild  bleaches like sodium perborate and hydrogen peroxide may be used with normal caution.

## USES OF SILK

Silk  is  an  expensive  luxury  fabric  used  for  making  different  garments.  Silk  is  used primarily in apparel and home furnishing items  because of its  appearance and  cost. Silk is extremely versatile and can be used to create a variety of fabrics from sheer chiffons  to  heavy  beautiful  brocades  and  velvets.  Because  of  silk  absorbency  it  is appropriate for warm weather wear. Because of its low conductivity it is used for cold weather  wear,  also  in  furnishing  silk  is  often  blended  with  other  fibres  to  add  soft luster for furnishing fabric. Occasionally expensive hands made rugs are made from silk.

WOOL: Wool has the one of the first fibres to be converted into fabric. Wool fibre grows from skin of sheep. It is composed of protein known as keratin. It is crimp and has scales on its surface depending upon the breed of sheep. The natural protein fibre consists of amino acids. Wool has 19 amino acids, keratin, protein and other organic acids.  Man  uses  wool  as  clothing  in  the  very  early  stages  of  human  history.  The primitive man is used it in the form of skin of certain animals to protect as well as to decorate his body. Man then discovered the use of hair of sheep after interlocking and twisting  them  together  under  pressure  and  thus  hair  of  sheep  were  used  in  making fabrics  the  interlocking  of  woolen  fabrics  is  known  as  felting.  Wool  was  probably known to the primitive man as he used sheep skin to cover his body even before the discovery of other fibres. Wool is yellowish white fibre and has medium luster. It is considered to be weak fibre than many other fibres however other properties such as resiliency and elasticity compensate for low strength.

Structure of wool: When the wool is fibre is untwisted it shows a kinky appearance. The length varies from 1,1/2 to 18 inches, the long fibres are coarser than short fibres. When observed under microscope the surface of the fibre seems to be consisted to scales irregular of shape and slightly overlapping like scales of fish.

## Classification of wool

Merino wool: Merino sheep produce the best quality wool which is originated from Spain.

## Classification by fleece

Lamb's wool: The first  fleece  sheared  from  lamb  about  six  to  eight  months  old  is known as lamb's wool. This is in fine quality and soft texture.

Hogget wool: Wool obtained from sheep of 12 to 14 months old that has not been previously shorn.

Pulled wool: When sheep is slaughtered for meat the wool is pulled called as pulled wool.

Cotty wool: Very poor grade wool.

Weather wool: Any fleece clipped after the first shearing is called weter wool.

## Manufacturing of Wool

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Shearing: Sheep are generally shorn of their fleeces in spring but the time of shearing differs in different parts of the world. Machine clippers remove the fleece faster and closer than hand clippers. Superior wool variety comes from the sides and shoulders where it grows longer, finer and softer is treated as good quality fleece. Wool from the chest, belly and shanks is treated as a second fleece.

Sorting and grading: Skilled workers do wool sorting. Each grade is determined by type, length, fineness, elasticity and strength. Separating of fibre by touch and sight.

Scouring: Washing of raw wool is an alkaline solution is known as scourcing. The wool is  treated  with  warm  water,  soap,  mild  solution  of  soda  ash  or  other  alkali  to remove  dirt  in  the  fibres.  If  the  raw  wool  is  not  sufficiently  clear  of  vegetable, substance after scouring is put through the carbonizing bath.

Carding: The  carding  process  introduces  the  classification  of  woolen  yarns  and worsted yarns. It makes the fibre parallel and some amount of dirt is removed due to straightening of fibres. Fibres are used for the worsted yarn are more straightened than the wool yarns.

Garnetting: Recycled wool fibres are obtained by separately reducing the unused and used fibrous mass by a picking and shredding process called garnetting.

Dyeing: If  the  wool  is  to  be  dyed  in  raw  stock  it  is  dyed  at  this  stage.  Some  wool fabrics piece dyed, some are yarn or skin dyed and some are top dyed.

Gelling and combing: The carded wool which is to be made into worsted yarn is put through  gilling  and  combing  operations.  The  geilling  process  removes  the  shorter staple  and  straightens  the  fibre.  This  process  removes  short  fibres  from  1  to  4  inch length  places  the  long  fibre  as  parallel  as  possible  and  further  cleans  the  fibre  by removing any remaining loose impurities.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF WOOL

Strength: It  is  stronger  than silk. When wet wool looses about 25% of its strength. Longer the fibre the greeter will be the strength of yarn.

Resiliency: Wool is highly resilient and comes to its original shape when hanged after wrinkled or created.

Stretchability: Wool is highly elastic. It is about 10 to 30% stretched when dry and 40 to 50% when wet upon receiving pressure upon drying it readily regains its original dimensions.

Shrink ability: Wool is resistant shrinkage. However long exposure to moisture may cause shrinkage.

Effect of friction: Friction will soften the wool fibre especially when wet and thus is advantageous in maintaining smooth, soft texture of fabrics.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Crimps: Wool fibre is more or less wavy and has twists. This waviness is termed as ‗crimp'. Finer the wool the more will be the crimps in it. Merino wool has 30 crimps per inch while coarse wool has one or two.

Effect of moisture: Wool is the most hygroscopic in nature. It can absorb up to 50% of  its  weight  and  carry  up  to  20%  weight,  without  giving  the  feeling  of  being  wet. Upon  drying  it  losses  moisture  slowly  preventing  rapid  evaporation  thus  avoiding chilling feel to the user.

Heat conductivity: Wool fibre is a part is a poor conductor of heat and therefore the fabrics made from the fibre are considered most suitable as winter wear.

Effect of heat: Low heat has no effect but strong heat weakens the fibre and destroys the colour of the fibre.

Action  of  acids: Dilute  acids  have  little  effect  but  either  hot  or  concentrated  acids weaken or dissolve the wool fibres.

Action  of  alkalis: Alkalis  tend  to  make  while  wool  yellowish,  strong  solutions  of sodium carbonate when heated destroys the fibre sodium hydroxide is highly injurious to the wool fibre. However borax and ammonia have no harmful influence on wool.

Action of bleaching agents: Strong bleaching agents like hypochlorite have harmful effects  on  wool,  Potassium  permanganate,  sodium  peroxide  and  hydrogen  peroxide however can safely be used for bleaching and stain removal.

Finishes given to wool: Felting, fulling, moth proofing, crabbing, decanting, London shrinking, napping, singeing and steaming.

Wool blends: Wool polyester, wool acrylic, wool nylon, silk and wool.

## USES OF WOOL

The  majority  of  wool  (72.8%)  is  used  in  apparel,  home  furnishing  account  for  1545%, industrial uses 6 to 7% and exports 5%, wool accounts for 3.3% of all fibres for apparel. The most important use of wool is for apparel coats, jackets, suits, dresses, skirts,  slacks  made  from  woven  fabrics  of  varying  weights  and  knitted  fabrics'.  All these gives the warmth garments and with good tailored look. In the home furnishing area the major use of wool is in carpets and rugs where wool is used more, cover to the carpets and warm in the rugs. Blends of different synthetic fibres with wool for suiting  materials  are  increasingly  important.  This  result  in  fabrics  that  are  more appropriate  in  warmer  conditions.  Polyester  is  the  most  important  fibre  used  in blending with wool.

MAN-MADE FIBERS: A  rayon  fiber  was  the  first  man-made  composed  of  pure cellulose  the  substance  of  which  is  the  man  constituent  of  cell  walls  of  trees  and cotton. Rayon fibers are made from cellulose that has been reformed or regenerated. Consequently, these fibers are identified as -regenerated cellulose fibers‖. Because of its luster and soft hand feel, it resembled silk and came to be known as -artificial silk‖. However it is more like cotton in its chemical composition

Rayon: Robert Hooke, the English naturalist, had prophesied the production of a fiber such as rayon, the first of the manmade fibers long ago in 1664. He believed that it was possible to  make  an  -artificial  glutinous  composition‖  much  resembling,  if  not fully like silk worm secretion George Audemars, a Swiss chemist, discovered how to make cellulose  nitrate.  In  1884,  count  Hilaire  de  hardonnet  produced  the  first  man made  textile  fibers  from  nitro  cellulose.  He  is  known  as  -father  of  Rayon‖.  Wood Rayon is produced in many ways. Viscose Rayon is popular among customers. It is made from pulp and cotton linters. The other is cellulose rayon (acetate rayon) in the chemist  terminology;  rayon  and  acetate  are  not  synthetic  because  natural  materialscotton,  linters  and  wood  pulp  are  used  in  their  manufacture,  rather  than  chemical elements.

Source  of  Rayon: Rayon  is  an  artificial,  man-made  or  synthetic  fibre  made  from cellulose. Commercially rayon was produced about 48 years back. Rayon produced at that  time  was  very  lustrous  they  were  given  this  name  which  means  -reflecting  the rays  of  sun‖.  The  main  objective  in  manufacturing  rayon  was  to  provide  a  cheap substitute for silk. India has been importing rayon fabrics and rayon yarn.

Manufacture of Rayons: All types of rayon are made from cellulose. There are main four main procedures by which cellulose is transformed into rayon. They are

- i. The nitrocellulose process
- ii. The cuprammonium process
- iii. The viscose process
- iv. The cellulose acetate process.

The general principles of rayon yarn production involve the following steps.

- a. To treat cellulose chemically for rendering from it a liquid
- b. To force the liquid through fine holes
- c. To change from liquid stream into solid cellulose filaments.

The  nitrocellulose  process: In  this,  cotton  is  reduced  to  nitrocellulose  by  treating cotton  with  sulphuric  and  nitric  acid.  This  gives  an  inflammable  material.  This material  is  dissolved  in  ether  and  the  fluid  is  force  through  tiny  holes  into  air.  The ether  evaporates  and  a  fine  thread  is  obtained,  which  is  treated  with  sodium hydrosulphide to render it non-flammable.

The cuprammonium process: This process has been used since 1897 . In this process, cotton  linters  are  used.  These  are  firs  boiled  in  soda  and  soda-ash  and  then  are bleached  with  chlorine.  These  are  dissolved  in  a  solution  of  copper  sulphate  and ammonium hydroxide. This liquid is left for ageing or ripening. This is then passed through  fine  jets  into  a  solution  of  dilute  acid  when  it  is  turned  into  regenerated cellulose filament. This filament is stretched to form a fine thread.

The  viscose  process: This  process  was  discovered  in  1892,  but  the  yarn  was commercially produced a few years later. In this process spruce chips are used. These are first bleached and then steeped in caustic soda to form alkali cellulose. It is treated with carbon bi-sulphide to form cellulose xanthate and is dissolved in dilute caustic soda solution. This is kept for ageing until a thick fluid is formed, which is known as viscose  This  fluid  is  forced  through  fine  jets  into  a  coagulating  solution  of  dilute sulphuric acid which regenerates the cellulose into a continuous fibre. This process is largely  used  in  the  manufacture  of  rayons.  If  a  dull  appearance  is  desired,  small

proportion  of  a  white  opaque  pigment  (usually  titanium  dioxide)  is  added  to  the viscose solution.

The cellulose acetate process: This process has been commercially developed since 1918 although the process was discovered half a century earlier in 1869.

In  this  process  cotton  inters  are  treated  with  solution  of  acetic  anhydride  and  acetic acid. This acetic acid combines with cellulose o form celluloseacetate. This is kept for ageing until it is ripened. This ripened product is washed with cold water  when the cellulose acetate separates into white flakes. The flakes are dissolved in acetone and filtered.  This  solution  is  then  forced  through  fine  holes  in  hot  air.  The  acetone evaporates and leaves a fine fibre of cellulose acetate.

## CHARACTERISTICS OF RAYON FIBRE

Strength: The tensile strength of viscose rayon is greater than that of wool but is only half  as  great  as  silk.  Viscose  rayon  is  also  weaker  than  cotton  and  its  strength  is reduced to 40 to 70 percent when wet. Yet it produces fairly durable, economical and serviceable fabric whose smoothness of surface favorably withstands with friction of wear

Elasticity: Viscose rayon has greater elasticity than cotton but less than wool and silk. While  viscose  rayon  fabrics  have  some  inherent  extensibility,  undue  strain  might cause them to sag or even burst.

Heat  Conductivity: Viscose  rayon  is  a  good  conductor  of  heat  and  is  therefore appropriate for summer clothing like cotton.

Absorbency: Viscose  rayon  is  one  of  the  most  absorbent  of  all  textiles.  It  is  more absorbent than cotton or linen, but less than wool and silk.

Reaction to Bleaches: Household bleaches containing sodium hypo chlorite, sodium perborate or hydrogen peroxide may be safely used.

Shrinkage: Viscose  rayon  fabrics  tend  to  shrink  more  than  cotton  fabrics.  Spun Viscose rayon fabrics shrink more, which can be given a shrink resistant finish, such as Sanforset.

Effect  of  Heat :  Viscose  rayon  is  pure  cellulose  fiber  which  burns  as  cotton.  When ironing, only moderately hot temperature must be used.

Reaction to Alkaline: Concentrated solutions of alkalies disintegrate Viscose rayon. A mild soap with lukewarm water is recommended in washing rayons.

Reaction to Acids: Being pure cellulose, the fabric is disintegrated by hot dilute and cold concentrated acids similar to that of cotton.

Affinity of Dyes: Viscose  rayon  fabrics  absorb  dye  evenly  and  can  be  dyed  with  a variety of dyes, like acid, chrome, and disperse.

## USES OF RAYON FIBER

Apparel: Accessories,  blouses,  dresses,  jackets,  lingerie,  linings,  millinery,  slacks, sports shirt, sportswear, suit, ties, work clothes.

Home  and  hotel  Furnishings: Bed  spreads  blankets,  curtains,  draperies,  sheets, slipcovers, table clothes, upholstery.

Industrial Uses: Industrial products, medical products, non-woven products.

Other Uses: Feminine hygiene products.

It's  used  in  industrial  wipes,  medical  supplies,  including  bandages,  diapers,  sanitary napkin, and tampons in non-woven fabrics.

POLYESTER  FIBER: Polyester  is  a  synthetic  fiber  invented  in  1941.  The  first polyester  fiber  is  known  as  ‗Dacron'  in  America  and  ‗Terylene'  in  Britain.  Later various  types  of  polyesters  are  produced.  Terylene  fiber  is  made  by  synthesizing terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. The ground work for development of polyester fiber is done by W.H. Carothers. Polyester fiber is the long chain polymer produced from  elements  derived  from  coal,  air,  water  and  petroleum.  Polyester  is  a thermoplastic  fiber  and  has  good  strength.  It  melts  in  flame  and  forms  a  grey  hard non-crushable bead. It is an easy care fabric and can be easily washed. Polyester fiber looks like a smooth, glass rod similar to Nylon. If delustered it shows black spotted appearance. The length, width, shape and luster of the polyester fibers are controlled during manufacture to suit a specific end use. It is mostly blended with other fibers to improve its absorbency and to lower static electricity.

Method  of  Manufacture: Generally  each  company  produces  its  own  variety  of polyester through there are likely modifications under specific trademarks. E.g.: PET (Principle  raw  material  is  ethylene  diamine  and  terepthalic  acid)  obtained  from petroleum and PCDT polyester.

Spinning of Fiber: The molten polymer is rigorously maintained at airtight condition, as oxygen will affect its stability. The viscous melt is extruded through spinneret, and the  filaments  are  subsequently  drawn  into  desired  polyester  fiber.  Variations  in production process depend on desired end results.

## Types of Polyester Yarn

The diameter of the polyester yarn is determined by;

- a. The rate extrusion of filaments from the spinneret.
- b. The number of spinneret holes and therefore the number of filaments
- c. The rate of drawing of filaments. The yarn comes in a wide range of diameter  and  staple  lengths.  The  yarns  are  produced  basically,  as monofilament,  multifilament  and  spun  and  sometimes  the  textured yarns are also produced.

## Characteristics of Polyester:

Shape and Appearance: These fibers are generally round and uniform. The fiber is partially transparent and white to slightly off -white in colour.

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

Strength: The PET polyesters are in general, stronger. Polyester is found in industrial uses and the highly durable fabrics.

Elasticity: Polyester fibers do not have high degree of elasticity. In general polyester fiber is characterized as having a high degree of stretch resistance, which means that polyester fabrics are not likely to stretch out of shape too easily.

Resilience: Polyester fibers have high degree of resilience. Not only does a polyester fabric resist wrinkling when dry, it also resists wrinkling when wet.

Drapability: Fabrics of polyester filament have satisfactory draping quality. Polyester spun yarn is flexible and softer, thereby draping quality is improved.

Heat  Conductivity :  Fabrics  of  polyester  filament  are  good  conductors  of  heat. Polyester staple does not provide greater insulation in the yarns and fabrics. One of the reasons for apparel greater warmth of polyester is its low absorbency.

Absorbency :  Polyester is one of the least absorbent fibers. This low absorbency has important advantages- they will dry very fast, suited for water repellent purposes, such as rain wear and they do not stain easily.

Dimensional  Stability :  If  the  polyester  is  properly  heat  set,  it  will  not  shrink,  nor stretch  when  subjected  to  boiling  water,  boiling  cleaning  solvents  or  ironing temperatures that are lower than heat setting temperatures.

Shrinkage: Polyester fabrics shrink as much as 20 %during wet-finishing operations and they are generally heat set in later treatments. They have excellent dimensional stability.

Cleanliness and Wash ability : Since polyester fibers are generally smooth, has low absorbency, many stains lie on surface, and are easily washed, by hand or machine but oil stains are very hard to remove.

## CHEMICAL PROPERTIES

Reaction to Alkalies :  At  room temperature, polyesters has good resistance to weak alkalies and fair resistance to strong alkali. It reduces with increase in temperature and alkalies concentration.

Reaction to Acids :  Depending upon type, polyester has good resistance to mineral and  organic  acids.  Highly  concentrated  solutions  at  high  temperatures  cause degradation. E.g.: Sulphuric Acid.

Effects of Bleaches : Fabrics of polyester may be safely bleached, because polyesters have  good  resistance  to  deterioration  to  household  bleaches.  If  the  polyester  have optical brightener, bleaching is not necessary.

Effect of Heat : Ironing should be done at low temperature. It gets sticky at 4400 F.

Effect  of  Light :  Polyester  has  good  resistance  to  degradation  by  sunlight.  Over prolonged use, gradual deterioration of fiber occurs.

Affinity for Dyes: Polyesters are dyed with appropriate disperse, developed dyes at high temperatures producing a good range of shades and color fastness.

Resistance to Perspiration Polyesters has no loss of strength from continued contact with either acid or alkaline perspiration.

Polyester  Blends :  Polyester  cotton  blend,  polyester  wool  blend,  polyester  rayon, polyester  silk  blend,  polyacetate  blend,  ,  polyester  and  nylon  are  some  common blends.

## 4.2.3 Uses of Polyester

The most important uses of the polyester is in -woven fabrics‖. The blended fabrics are  attractive,  durable  and  comfortable,  retain  their  appearance  well  and  easy  care. The first use of staple polyester was in tropical suiting for men's summer suits. The suits were light in weight and machine washable.

Polyester and polyester blends are also used in home-furnishings, sheets, blankets, bed spreads, curtains that match bed spreads, mattress ticking, and table clothes. They are used  in  upholstery  fabrics;  polyester  carpets  have  a  softer  hand  than  nylon  carpets. Spun yarn is used in knitted fabrics. Here polyester with cotton blends is used. The other  important  use  where  it  is  used  is  as  fiber  fill.  Used  in  pillows,  comforters, bedspreads, other quilted households and apparels, winter jackets etc.

Non-woven fabrics are the fourth important use of the polyester fabrics e.g.: fusible interfacings, pillow covers, mattress interlining etc. It has many industrial uses too in pile  fabrics,  tents,  ropes,  cording,  fishing  line,  cover  stock  for  disposable  diapers, garden hoses, sails, seat belts, filter fabrics used in road buildings, fertilizer bags, in medicinal field for artificial arteries, veins and hearts.

## FINISHES

Introduction: Finish  is  defined  as  anything  that  is  done  to  fibre,  yarn  or  fabric  to change its appearance. The finish often determines the fabric care required. Finishing alters  the  surface  of  a  fabric  and  therefore  its  look  and  feel.  Fabrics  or  garments generally  have  to  be  finished  to  make  the  material  presentable  and  attractive.  It  is often the finish which increases the sales value of the textile goods finish is usually applied to fabrics. As yarn and fabrics comes from the spinner weaver and knitter they are often in unfinished condition. The material may also be soiled and have oil stains. In  fact,  materials  fresh  from  their  manufacture  are  referred  to  as  being  in  a  grey  or brown state. The finishing processes are required make the materials attractive They also improve their serviceability.

Classification  of  finishes: Finishes  are  classified  on  several  basis  the  newly constructed fabrics as they come out of the loom are called grey goods. This does not mean that the colors of the fabrics are grey, but it simply means that any unfinished fabric must pass through various finishing process to make them suitable for end use. The aims of the finishing process are:

## Accommodation Management                                                                         HM-103

- 1. To make the material attractive.
- 2. To improve suitability and utility.
- 3. To produce variety.
- 4. To give weight.

Finishes are classified in to two types

- 1. Mechanical
- 2. Chemical

Dyeing is sometimes considered part of the finishing process. It can be sometimes be carried out at the same time that the fabric is straightened and brought to its desired finish,  width  and  length  for  other  processes,  the  fabric  must  be  dried  first  and  then lightly damped for the final finishing treatment. The most common finishing process is listed below. The list is not a sequence nor all are the processes used on all kinds of fabrics. Some fabrics go through more than one process while each fabric is given its own characteristic finish.

## MECHANICAL

Beetling: This process produces luster and softness and gives te fabric a firm, leathery feel.  Earlier  it  was  done  by  beating  the  surface  with  wooden  mallets,  but  now  a machine with a number of steel hammer is used. The fibres are flattened, the weaves are closed and thus the desired lustrous effect is produced.

Calendaring: Calendaring  is  essentially  an  ironic  process.  Most  fabrics  (and  yarns too)  become  stiff  board  like  when  wet  and  dried  under  tension.  Running  the  fabric through  a  calendar  removes  the  stiffness  and  makes  it  quite  soft.  At  the  same  time calendaring  flattens  the  yarns  and  makes  it  so  lustrous.  The  process  consists  of applying a lot of pressure by passing the cloth between cylinders of heavy weight of compressed cotton and steel. Rayon fabrics are not calendared as as cotton or linen, but  silk  often  requires  fairly  heavy  calendaring  some  calendars  use  waxy  calendars substances  to  give  added  luster  in  addition  to  friction  treatment  by  steam  heated pressure cylinders. Calendaring flattens and close the threads of the fabric to give it the  required  smooth  feel  and  appearance.  The  finish  depends  chiefly  on  pressure, temperature and moistures.

Shearing/ brushing: This process removes the short fibers from the cloth coming off a  loom. The cloth is first passed over one or two stream heated copper cylinders to remove moisture and to raise a nap. The projecting fibres are then singed (burnt) by passing the cloth over a hot plate or through a gas flame at high speed, leaving the cloth with a smooth surface. It is immediately put into water to remove any sparks.

Tentering: To bring a fabric to the right width it is passed through a 20-90 feet long tentering machine. The cloth is carried through the machine by two moving chains of clips  or  pins  one  on  each  side  which  grip  the  selvedge  firmly.  Tentering  is  an important and necessary operation because the fabric has been pulled in length during bleaching,  dyeing  and  drying  and  is  therefore  generally  narrower  than  the  required finished length. In order that the stretching may takes place easily, the cloth is slightly dampened or steamed. After stretching it is passed through a hot air chamber to dry and set at this width.

Moireing : One of the most interesting surfaces is the ‗moire' finish. A cloth with a filling wiser rib weave is run between rollers engraved with many lines and thus given a watered effect. On acetate clothes. The finish will remain in good condition after the fabrics are laundered. Rayons are given resin treatment to set the design.

Embossing: The fabric  is  passed  between  heated  rollers  that  imprint  or emboss  the design on the fabric. This design is less expensive than a woven design.

Glazing: After  the  fabrics  are  bleached,  dyed  or  printed  they  may  be  given  a  stiff polished or glazed surface. Starch glue or resin may be used to stiffen the fabric. Then smooth hot rollers that generate friction are applied since the advent of resins in the finishing field permanent finish gaze can be applied to chintz and other muslins.

Sanforizing: Many fabric shrink after their first wash. The process ensures less than 1% shrinkage for fabric after washing. The process is carried out by passing the pre shrunk fabric between a thick cloth and surface of a steam heated roller.

Napping: The warmth and softness of wool flannel or a brushed wool sweater is due in part to the fuzzy soft surface called nap. It is the process of raising short fibers of cloth to the surface by means of revolving cylinders with metallic points. Cotton and synthetic fabrics of spun yarns may be napped to resemble wool in texture. Generally yarns used in the fabric should have low twist.

Filling Finishes : The aim of the use filling or sizing agents on fabrics are:

- i. To stiffen the fabric
- ii. To soften it
- iii. To impart to it a body and weight
- iv. To give it a glazed smooth finish

Sizing, stiffing and starching: To increase the weight, body crispiness, stiffness and luster cotton and polyester blends are stiffed. Generally starch, glue, wax, casein, clay etc are used. It is not a permanent finish.

Weighting of silk and wool: weighting is the term used for filling in silk and wool. The filling agents are metallic salts.

Silk: it is weighted either at the yarn stage or as woven material. It is also weighted during the process of dyeing by adding weighting substances to the dye. The usual weighting substances used are tin chloride and tannate Fibres absorb salt  and swell. These are  not removed by washing. Heavily weighted silk has a poor wearing quality. Wool:  wool  is  weighted  with  magnesium  chloride  so  that  the  cloth  absorb  more moisture and its weight is thus increased

## CHEMICAL PROCESS

Mercerizing :  Applying  the  caustic  soda  under  controlled  conditions  gives  cotton fabrics a silky luster and beautiful sheen. It also gives the cloth a greater affinity for coloring  matters  for  especially  deeper,  brighter  shades  with  dye  stuff.  The  cloth  is impregnated with an 18-20% solution of caustic soda for one half of two minutes at room temperatures. The cloth is stretched while saturated and then washed out while it is still in tension. The treatment produces a permanent change in the structure of the cotton fiber.

Parchment zing: These are the permanent finishes on cotton and still remain of great importance. They were discovered by John Mercer in 1844. The higher concentration of  the  sulphuric  acid  produces  the  parchmentsing  effects.  Parchmentsing  acid probably  gelatinizes  the  surface  of  the  cotton  and  causes  the  fibers  of  cohere  some extent.

Creping: It is a chemical process by the treatment caustic soda on fabrics. The soda paste is applied to fabrics in a definite design of strips or figure. The parts to which the paste is applied shrinks leaving the other parts unshrunk. Thus the creped material will produced.

Burnt out finish: Burnt out finish gives transparent effect possible on blended fabrics only looks different from others. Forms opaque woven designs against a transparent back ground.

Starch less finish : To reduce the use of starch for a crisp finish that can be durable for repeated washings. Cottons are treated with resins. This starchless finish is permanent and does not dissolves in laundering.

Wash  and  wear: Permanent  starch  less  finish  can  be  used  on  curtains,  draperies, sheer cottons for apparel. It is used on organdy, lawn, voile and other sheet cottons.

Bleaching: Bleaches are used to render colored or discolored fabrics white. Bleaches are  used  in  laundering  to  remove  stains  that  do  not  respond  to  normal  washing. Bleaches should not be used as cleansers. It is not possible to bleach dirty laundry. Bleaching agents can be divided into two classes:

- 1. Oxidizing bleach
- 2. Reducing bleach.

Oxidizing  bleach supply  oxygen  that  combines  with  stains  to  form  a  colorless compound. Normal as well as stained fabrics can be oxidized so the bleach must be in contact with the fabric only till the stain is removed. Longer contact will weaken the fabric.

Reducing bleaches work by removing oxygen from the colorings matter of the stain.

## YARNS, YARN MAKING AND FABRIC CONSTRUCTION

A yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres. Strands of fibres are brought closer  to  each  other  by  twisting.  Twists  impart  strength  to  the  fibre  strand  which  is then termed as a yarn. It is suitable for the production of fabrics, thread for sewing, crocheting, knitting, embroidery and/or rope making. A thread is a highly twisted and smooth strand of fibre. It is used for sewing, embroidery, etc.

Spinning of yarns: Do you know how a yarn is made? Yes, you guessed it right, a yarn is spun. Spinning is the process by which a group of fibres is pulled, drawn and twisted together to make a yarn. Do you remember Mahatma Gandhi and his charkha

or the spinning wheel? Mahatma Gandhi, would daily take a hand full of cotton and spin  it  into  a  yarn  on  his charkha .  He  promoted charkha during  India's  freedom struggle as a symbol of self-reliance and a source of income.

A traditional spinning wheel (charkha) : A charkha is for hand spinning. The yarn spun on a charkha can have different thickness. Thick yarn is used for floor coverings, medium thickness for upholstery items and fine quality yarn is used for making dress material. Different types of fibres - cotton, wool, hemp and silk are spun on charkha in the villages in many states of India.

Twists  given  to  fibre  strands  for  formation  of  a  yarn  can  be  either 'S-twist' (clockwise) or 'Z-twist' (anticlockwise). The quality and strength of yarn is affected by the number of twists in inch. Lesser the number of twists per inch, bulkier and less strong is the yarn and more the number of twists, finer and stronger is the yarn. Figure 10.5 shows S and Z twists and Figure 10.6 shows number of turns in a yarn.

Spinning by Machine: Both, the fibres as well as filaments are spun into yarns that are then used for different end uses. Fibres available in the filament form are first cut into short lengths and then made into yarns called spun yarns. Various steps followed for making yarns are:

- I. Cleaning: When  the  natural  fibres  are  harvested  or  collected,  these contain dry leaves, stems, seeds, dirt and unwanted materials that are removed during cleaning.
- II. Carding: The  fibres  sometimes  get  matted  and  stick  to  each  other. Carding  machine  opens  and  arranges  the  fibres  in  a  parallel  manner. The carded web of fibres is turned into a soft rope called sliver .
- III. Combing: It  is  an  optional  step  used  for  making  fine  quality  yarn. Carded slivers  are  combed  to  separate  long  and  short  fibres  with  the help  of  series  of  combs.  Cleaning,  carding  and  combing  steps  are omitted while making spun yarns from cut filaments of synthetic fibres. For these synthetic fibres only spinning and winding is done.
- IV. Spinning: Carded and combed slivers are further drawn and spun into yarns. The yarn is a single strand but may be plied into several strands:
- V. Winding: The  yarn is  wound into various packages according to the weight or length of the yarn and its end use. Some of the common yarn packages  for  fabric  construction  are-  ball  (yarns  for  hand  knitting), reels  or  bobbins  for  sewing  embroidery  and  hanks,  cones,  etc..  Balls reels  of  sewing  reels  of  embroidery  yarn  hanks  cone  thread.  After spinning, a specific length of  yarn is  wound in  the form  of  packages called balls, reels, hanks, cones, etc., depending on the weight or length of yarn and its end use.

Classification of Yarns: Yarns simple novelty knotted yarn, loop yarn single strand ply/multi-strand slub yarn, feather yarn.

The yarns may be classified into two groups:

- i) Simple yarns
- ii) Novelty yarns

Simple Yarn: In the construction of simple yarn, only one kind of fibre is used. The manner in which the fibres are twisted will be the same throughout the yarn. Yarns are known as simple, ply or cable, depending upon the number of strands they contain

Single Strand Yarn: In this, a number of fibres are twisted together into a continuous length. The yarn consists of one kind of fibre and of one colour. This type f yarn is the one usually found in most standards fabrics for clothing and household use.

Ply Yarn: Two or more than to yarns are twisted together to form ply yarn. These are known as multiple strand yarn. If two single strands are twisted together, the resulting yarn is known as two-ply yarn, if three are twisted together, three-ply yarn and so on.

Novelty Yarns: The contrition of these yarns is of a complex nature and is varied in any ways. These yarns are usually ply yarns of different kinds of fibres or of different colours and are irregular rather than smooth. Single strand yarn of different colours, sizes or fibres may be twisted together to form one complex yarn. Another variety is brought about I this kind of yarn by varying tension or sped after intervals of certain length- thus, allowing one part to loop or twist around another. Novelty yarns are also constructed from simple yarn by varying the amount of twist. The complex type of novelty yarn is used with two objects in view, one is to combine different fibres e.g. cotton and rayon may be blended with or covered by wool and silk. This lowers the cost of production. The other purpose to produce novelty yarns for the construction of novelty  yarn,  at  least  one  or  single  yarns  are  used,  one  forms  the  foundation  yarn known as a base or the core and the other, the effect yarn, which is wound or looped around the first one. A third yarn called binder yarn is often used to fasten or tie the effect yarn to the foundation yarn. These types of yarns are mostly used for drapery and upholstery fabrics.

## FABRIC CONSTRUCTION

Weaving and knitting, the two most popular methods of fabric construction have been discussed in detail here.

Weaving: Cotton multiple strand yarn fibres do not break easily thickness synthetic. Weaving is  interlacing  of  two  sets  of  yarns  -warp  and  weft  at  90o  angles  to  each other. Straight yarns in fabric are known as warp yarns. Horizontal yarns are known as weft yarns.  Along  the  length  of  the  woven  fabric,  on  both  sides,  end  yarns  are woven very densely and the portion is named as selvedge . It does not allow the fabric yarns to come out from the lengthwise edge. The portion between the two selvedges is the body of the fabric.

Basic Weaves: Weaves are broadly classified as basic and novelty weaves. Most of fabrics are produced in basic weaves , which are of three typesplain, twill and satin weave.

- a. Plain  weaves -  Plain  weave  is  also  known  as  homespun,  tabby  or taffeta  weave.  It  is  the  easiest  to  weave  where  one  weft  yarn alternatively moves over one and under another warp yarn. Maximum

production of fabric is  done in  plain  weave.  It  is  inexpensive  weave, most suitable for printing and embroideries. To see the variations of the weave,  note  the  fabrics  like  muslin,  cambric,  hand  spun  and  hand woven khaddar, organdy, poplin, voile, etc.

- b. Twill weaves It is woven on three to four harness loom. In this, one weft  yarn  moves  over  two  and  under  one  warp  yarn.  Twill  woven fabric  is  distinguished  by  a  continuous  diagonal  line  called  wale. Variation  in  diagonal  lines  produces  various  designs  of  twill.  Twill weave is woven tightly, that is why it is suitable for work clothes and for  men's  clothes.  Examples  of  Twill  woven  fabrics  are  gabardine, tweed, denim, jean, etc.
- c. Satin weaves It is woven on five to twelve harness looms. If woven on a five harness loom, one weft yarn passes under 4 warp yarns and goes over one warp.

Knitting: Knitting is the process of formation of loops of yarns and drawing of new loops  through  those  formed  previously  (interloping).  Depending  on  the  types  of knitting, it  either  moves right to left  or left  to  right  (weft  knitting)  or  the  yarns  run lengthwise  (warp  knitting).  Hand  knitting  is  the  most  common  example  of  weft knitting, though it is also done on machines to make many types of sweaters, T-shirts, socks, etc. Warp knitting is only possible on machines.

End use of different fabrics: When you go to a shop, you give specification of the fabric  you want, to the salesperson, often you go to different shops to buy fabric or readymade garments. In other words, shops usually specialize in the type of items they sell.  This  way it is easy for  you to find what  you want and the shop can also stock good variety of related products.

Since you have already studied about the properties of various types of fibres, yarns, fabrics and weaves, it will be easy for you to use this knowledge to recognize fabrics and choose them for the end use in your mind.

## 5.7 Soft Furnishings

Soft furnishing are piece of items that are both necessary for comfort and convenience as  well  as  decorative,  providing  colour,  pattern  and  texture  to  the  room.  Soft furnishings  include  fibres  that  are  used  for  curtains,  loose  covers,  cushions, bedspreads and quilts. Some articles  in  addition  provide  warmth  and  comfort.  Each article is subjected to variable amount of wear and tear.

Duvets/ Quilts: Provides a warm light bed covering but are quite expensive initially. They may be used as such or given a fabric covering.  Satin, polyester, silk and good quality fabrics are suitable for the top layer of the quilts.  Less slippery material like satin or linen may be used for under layer to prevent slipping.

Duvets have become increasingly popular in hotels and are fast replacing the blanket, especially on double beds. They consist of a filling sandwiched or stitched in a fabric case with a changeable cover. The fillers may be duck/goose down, a feather mix or a combination of the two. The down feathers  are  the  small,  fluffy  feathers.  Although they  are  warmer,  professional  cleaning  is  necessary  and  they  are  heavier  and  more expensive than their synthetic counterparts. The synthetic filling is usually polyester fibres.  These  duvets  are  lighter  and  can  be  washed  in  large-capacity  washing machines. Even if the establishment uses natural fillings to provide the best degree of comfort, a small stock of duvets filled with man-made fibres should be made available for anyone who has an allergy to the natural product. It is essential for the duvet to have  an  outside  cover.  Changing  a  duvet  cover  is  a  skill  which  is  developed  with practice. To save laundry costs and la bour, it is advisable to provide a covering sheer in  conjunction  with  the  duvet  cover.  Though  it  is  common  to  have  all  of  them  in white,  the  duvet  cover,  the  bottom  sheet  and  valance  could  be  part  of  the  colour scheme of the guest room.

## Care and maintenance of Duvets and quilts:

-  Mend  any  tar  and  damage  as  soon  as  possible.  Remove  stains  and  grease marks immediately by dry-cleaning.
-  Follow  the  manufacturer's  instructions  for  regular  cleaning  of  duvets  and quilts.
-  Always use duvets and quilts with easily launder able covers, so that these can be removed and washed separately.
-  The cover of a duvet should be 2-4 inches larger than duvet on each side to give it room to expand. Smooth out duvets and quilts with a light hand while making  the  bed.  When  storing  feather  filled  quilts  and  duvets  use  mothrepellent chemicals.

Pillows  and  bolsters: The  best  and  most  expensive  pillows  are  filled  with  down. Others have a mixture of down and feathers and some are filled with manmade fibres. Foam pillow are suitable for people allergic to dust and feathers. Feather pillows don't last long. Foam pillows may also last for 10 years. Kapok, the cotton like fibre from the seeds of the silk-cotton tree, was earlier used as a filling for pillows; but it is not used for pillows in hotels now since kapok -filled pillows cannot be laundered or drycleaned. Bolsters are elongated pillow used on settees, divans and beds. In the past, they sometimes formed an under-pillow; but they are not use on the bed any more.

## Care and maintenance of Pillow and bolsters:

-  Dust and shake pillow lightly before making the bed
-  Any damage  to the ticking should be repaired immediately
-  If the pillows have the synthetic filling, they may be washed individually on a regular  basis.  Pillows  with  natural  filling  should  be  dry-cleaned  when necessary.
-  Latex and foam pillow can be wiped clean.

Bedspread/Bedcover/Counterpane: These  are  purchased,  considering  appearance, durability and size. The colour and print should match the décor, and soil should not show  easily.  The  fabric  should  drape  well  and  not  crease  easily  (quilted  for  this purpose).  The  durability  of  the  fabric  is  judged  by  the  effect  of  laundering  and constant use. The life expectancy may be totally disregarded in order to meet with a

certain decorative colour scheme. Readymade bedcovers lack individuality so they are usually  stitched  and  a  number  of  styles  are  possible.  Bedcovers  should  be interchangeable wherever possible.

## Care and maintenance of Bedspread/Bedcover/Counterpane:

-  Any damage should be repaired as soon as it is detected.
-  Conventional blankets should be laundered or dry-cleaned when necessary.
-  Stains grease marks should be removed by spot-cleaning or dry-cleaning.
-  On a daily basis, while making the bed, gently shake out the blankets

Cushion: It  may  be  used  to  increase  the  comfort  of  chairs  and  sofas  and  provide colour pattern and texture to the room.  They may be fitted to form a seat or a back; or may be used loosely as scatter cushions.  Shapes may vary from square, rectangular, circular, triangular, semi-circular to bolsters, which are elongated pillows. They will be filled with down, feathers, kappa, rubber, polyfill, urethane foam, thermo coal ball, silk cotton, foam plastic etc.

## Care and maintenance: Cushions require constant attention

-  Shake and tidy frequently
-  Repair when necessary
-  Brush and suction clean regularly
-  Remove covers and wash or dry clean.

Curtains: Windows  dressing  is  essential  to  enhance  or  obscure  the  shape  of  the window and improve the style and décor of the window and room.  It provides privacy and  thermal  insulation,  controls  light,  and  helps  in  sound  reduction.   This  can  be achieved  by  the  use  of  curtains.  The  line,  colour,  pattern  and  texture  contribute  to character and atmosphere of the room.  Selection of fibre should be done with regard to its resistance to fading, abrasion, drape, dimensional stability and flame resistance. The exposure to sunlight and airborne soiling should be considered. Lining of curtains helps to reduce damage of fading and rotting.  Curtains are subjected to abrasion by being pulled and drawn, brush against, rub along a floor or window frames and being laundered.  The abrasion resistance depends upon the type of fibre selected and fabric construction. Loosely woven material tends to loose drape and constant hand drawing may cause loss of shape.

## 5.8 Summary

As we know the housekeeping department is responsible of maintenance and aesthetic upkeep of the entire hotel but apart from that housekeeping also look after the interior of the hotel which includes floor finishes, wall covering, furniture, soft furnishing and many others. The chapter also discussed fibres and fabric construction.  A student of housekeeping operation should have a fundamental knowledge of fibres, weaves, and finishes and so on.

## 5.9 Key Terms

Antiques: It  includes  pieces  from  an  earlier  period.  Genuine  antiques  are,  by definition, at least 100 years old considered an antique.

Backing: Natural materials like jute, hemp, glue and starch are used along with resin, synthetic rubber and polypropylene to form the backing.  A secondary backing may be added to improve resilience.

Built in furniture: The piece of furniture is fitted ad fixed into architectural space, usually their cost is incorporated into the building cost.

Castor: these are the wheel fixed at the base or to the legs of furniture and equipment to make them mobile.

Cork: Cork tile is made from the outer bark of oak trees. The cork is ground into large granules, mixed with synthetic resins, and pressed into sheets, which are then cut into tiles.

Dado: A strong or more easily cleaned material used to surface the lower part of the wall approximately upto 150 cm height from the floor.

Duvet: quilts filled with down feathers or synthetic fibres.

Pile: The carpet pile absorbs most of the wear. It is called the face of the carpet, this is the part which is seen on the surface.

Under lay: The underlay acts as a shock absorber between the backing and the sub floor.  It makes the carpet softer and provides insulation.  Underlay may be made of felt, rubber, foam or jute with polypropylene backing.
