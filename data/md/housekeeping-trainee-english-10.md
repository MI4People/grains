## Foreword

The National Curriculum Framework-2005 (NCF-2005) recommends bringing  work  and  education  into  the  domain  of  the  curricula, infusing it in all areas of learning while giving it an identity of its own at relevant stages. It explains that work transforms knowledge into experience and generates important personal and social values such as self-reliance, creativity and cooperation. Through work one learns to find one's place in the society. It is an educational activity with an inherent potential for inclusion. Therefore, an experience of  involvement  in  productive  work  in  an  educational  setting  will make one appreciate the worth of social life and what is valued and appreciated in society. Work involves interaction with material or other people (mostly both), thus creating a deeper comprehension and  increased  practical  knowledge  of  natural  substances  and social relationships.

Through  work  and  education,  school  knowledge  can  be  easily linked to learners' life outside the school. This also makes a departure from the legacy of bookish learning and bridges the gap between the school, home, community and the workplace. The NCF - 2005 also emphasises Vocational Education and Training (VET) for all those children who wish to acquire additional skills and/or seek livelihood through vocational education after either discontinuing or completing their school education. VET is expected to provide a 'preferred and dignified' choice rather than a terminal or 'last-resort' option.

As  a  follow-up  of  this,  NCERT  has  attempted  to  infuse  work across  the  subject  areas  and  contributed  in  the  development  of the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) for the country, which was notified on 27 December 2013. It is a quality assurance framework  that  organises  all  qualifications  according  to  levels  of knowledge, skills and attitude. These levels, graded from one to ten, are defined in terms of learning outcomes, which the learner must possess regardless of whether they are obtained through formal, nonformal or informal learning. The NSQF sets common principles and guidelines for a nationally recognised qualification system covering Schools, Vocational Education and Training Institutions, Technical Education Institutions, Colleges and Universities.

It is under this backdrop that Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE), Bhopal, a constituent of NCERT  has  developed learning outcomes based modular

curricula  for  the  vocational  subjects  from  Classes  IX  to  XII.  This has  been  developed  under  the  Centrally  Sponsored  Scheme  of Vocationalisation of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education of the Ministry of Education, erstwhile Ministry of Human Resource Development.

This textbook has been developed as per the learning outcomes based  curriculum,  keeping  in  view  the  National  Occupational Standards (NOS) for the job role and to promote experiential learning related  to  the  vocation.  This  will  enable  the  students  to  acquire necessary skills, knowledge and attitude.

I  acknowledge the contribution of the development team, reviewers and all the institutions and organisations, which have supported in the development of this textbook.

NCERT would welcome suggestions from students, teachers and parents, which would help us to further improve the quality of the material in subsequent editions.

## About the textbook

The Hospitality Industry is an industry which mostly depends on the availability of leisure time and disposable income. It comprises of a broad category of fields within the Tourism and Service industry that includes lodging, event planning, theme parks, transportation, cruise  line,  and  other  such  activities.  A  hospitality  unit  such as  a  restaurant,  hotel  or  even  an  amusement  park  consists  of multiple  groups  of  facility  maintenance,  direct  operation  servers, housekeepers, porters, kitchen workers, bartenders, management, marketing and human resources, etc. Some important sectors of the hospitality industry are: Accommodation sector, Food and Beverage sector, Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Events (MICE) sector, Clubs  and  gaming  sector,  Entertainment  and  recreation  sector, Travel and tourism sector, Visitor information sector.

## Clea n P a ntry a n d Canteen Area

The  term  'pantry'  is  derived  from  the  French  word peneterie meaning  'from  Pain',  the  French  word  for bread. A pantry area in the hotel is a place where food, beverage and even sometimes dishes, cooking utensils and cleaning chemicals, linen or other provisions are stored.  Food  and  beverage  pantries  are  an  ancillary capacity to kitchen. It can be called as the little kitchen in a hotel.

This  unit  explains  the  importance  of  cleaning  the canteen  or  kitchen  area.  Various  types  of  cleaning products are used to clean and sanitise the food service area.  It  explains  the  various  types  of  cleaning  agents and  equipment  used  in  a  canteen  and  kitchen  area.

## SeSSion 1: enSuring CleanlineSS around WorkplaCe

In a hotel, it is important to keep food safe for eating so that people do not get infected. The best way to maintain the prescribed hygiene standards is to keep everything clean. Cleanliness is required at the areas where:

- · food is pre-prepared, prepared, stored and served.
- · equipment used for cooking and serving food is kept.

The canteen and kitchen equipment get dirty quickly through normal usage. Germs in a food production area may spread and the food will not be safe for consumption.

Cleanliness is important in the Hospitality Industry. If the canteen premises and serving or eating crockery and cutlery are not clean, the guests will notice this and would not want to eat at such a place. Not only this, but also the guest would not recommend the canteen or eatery to other people, leading to loss of business.

To keep this in check, the government has made some rules for the prevention of food infection. In India, this law is called the Food Act. It sets minimum (lowest level) standards for cleanliness of food storage, preparation and service areas, and for hygienic (clean) food handling practices.

Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is one more systematic preventive approach to protect food from biological, chemical and physical hazards in transportation.  It  also  prevents  the  contamination  or cross contamination of food.

## Cleaning  Agents  used  in  the  Canteen  and Kitchen Areas

## Cleaning agents

Various  cleaning  products  are  used  to  clean  and sanitise the food service area. Specific products are used for  different  purposes.  It  is  important  to  know  which cleaning agent is to be used for each cleaning task and how to use the products properly and safely. Cleaning

agents  can  be  dangerous  if  they  are  not  used  in  the prescribed  manner.  They  must  be  handled  carefully and kept away from food. They should be stored in a separate area in a safe and lockable place.

Various modern chemical manufacturer companies provide  colour  coding  for  different hazardous  and semi-hazardous chemicals; they also provide signs for handling and using them safely.

## Types of cleaning agents

The major types of  cleaning  products  used  in  a  hospitality business may be called by different brand names.

Their names are as follows:

| Type of  cleaner          | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Abrasive  cleaners        | ·  Used for scouring and cleaning ceramic or enamel surfaces  e.g.  the  cleaner's  sink.  Don't  use  on  the  surfaces  that  scratch easily. ·  This chemical can be hard to rinse away, so wipe and rinse  as soon as possible after you use them.                         |
| Detergents                | ·  Available in different strengths, so always follow dilution  instructions on the label. ·  They are used for heavy-duty cleaning e.g. fat, grease and  oil  on steel, most plastics, glass, ceramics and concrete.  They are often used in dish and glass washing machines. |
| Chlorine or  Bleach       | ·  Generally used to disinfect, bleach and deodorise. ·  They  may  have  adverse  effect  on  rubber,  plastic  and  aluminium. ·  They should never be mixed with other cleaning products  as they may give off toxic fumes.                                                 |
| Sanitisers                | ·  Used to kill germs on a surface. These are used on food  preparation surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Disinfectants             | ·  Used to  reduce  and  kill  germs.  They  should  be  used  in  and around rubbish bins and other non-food preparation  areas. ·  They may have a strong smell, so they are not suitable for                                                                                |
| Special  cleaning  agents | ·  Used for  a  specific  cleaning  task  e.g.  to  remove  difficult  stains from small areas, clean windows and glass, clean  stainless steel or rubbish bins.                                                                                                               |
| Polish                    | ·  Used  to  protect  the  surfaces  from  spills.  Floors  can  be  slippery after they have been polished.                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Safe use of cleaning agents

In Hospitality or Food Service Industry, chemicals used by workers for cleaning may be toxic (poisonous). They can be dangerous if inhaled or consumed and the person might be hospitalised for treatment. So it is of utmost importance to take all precautions during their use.

## If you use a product wrongly:

- · You  might  harm  yourself  or  people  you  are working  with, e.g., splashing chemicals  into your face or eyes or mixing the wrong chemicals together and causing toxic fumes.
- · Chemicals  may  damage  the  surface  on  which they are used.
- · If  chemicals  get  sprayed  on  food,  they  may  be poisonous and unsafe for infection.

## Guidelines for using the cleaning agents safely

- 1. Read the directions for handling and following these carefully.
- 2. Always store all the cleaning products in a locked storeroom or secured place.
- 3. Always use the correct PPE to protect yourself from splashes or spills.
- 4. Put all the cleaning products back where they belong after you have finished using them.
- 5. Always be cautious and don't use cleaning chemicals near food.
- 6. Never store chemicals in food containers.
- 7. Be cautious and never light a cigarette or a match near chemicals or chemical storage areas.
- 8. Never smell a chemical as you might get a burn inside of your nose or faint.
- 9. Follow the manufacturer's instructions while using and diluting chemicals (mixing them with water).
- 10. Before doing any cleaning task. Always read warning signs or labels about the cleaning products.
- 11. Before using chemicals, read the label carefully.
- 12. Always put the chemical into water rather than water into the chemical, so that there is no splashing.
- 13. Always know where the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are kept and how to read and use them.
- 14. Always use the prescribed method for lifting heavy containers of chemicals. Bend your knees, not your back. Or take someone's help to lift heavy loads.

<!-- image -->

## Diluting chemicals

For diluting chemicals, a systematic procedure is must to be followed. Read the labels and directions carefully. Here is an example for the instructions on the label for diluting a floor cleaner with water.

If the capacity of your bucket is 10 litres:

- 1. Fill  the  bucket  with  warm  water  to  near  full capacity i.e. about 10 L.
- 2. Now, multiply the amount of floor cleaner by 10 to  match  the  formula.  Thus,  mix  100  ml  of  it with water.

The water and the chemical must  be in the recommended ratio to balance with each other.

| Water                    | Chemical            | Ratio               |
|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 litre × 10 = 10 litres | 10 ml × 10 = 100 ml | 1:10                |
|                          |                     | 10 ml:100 ml = 1:10 |

## Dos and Don'ts while measuring chemicals

- 1. Always  measure  the  chemicals  in  the  quantity required.
- 2. Do not guess how much to use and always use the right quantity.
- 3. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions.
- 4. Always  put  the  chemical  into  water  so  that there is no splashing. Never pour water into the chemical.
- 5. A lot of chemicals are pre-mixed so you do not need to dilute them.

## Guidelines for disposing off used chemical solutions

Specialised  knowledge  and  experience  is  required  to deal with and use a chemical.

- 1. Once you have finished the task, dispose it safely.
- 2. Never  pour  it  back  into  its  original  container. It might  lead to contaminating  the  original chemicals.
- 3. Some  chemicals,  such  as  detergents,  can  be poured down cleaners' sink. Others, which may

- be  harmful  to  the  environment,  need  special disposal. They may need to be bottled and sent to an approved location.
- 4. Before  using  any  chemicals,  always  read  the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or the manufacturer's instructions before disposing the chemicals.

## Cleaning Equipment used in a Canteen and Kitchen Area

Use of cleaning equipment depends upon the type and size of operation. Every piece of equipment is important and performs a specific function in the whole operation.

There are mostly two types of cleaning equipment needed in a food service industry.

## Manual cleaning equipment

The cleaning equipment you use depends on the part of the kitchen that is to be cleaned and the material that it is made of. For example:

- · A  tiled  floor  in  a  kitchen  wet  areamop, bucket or scrubbing brush
- · A  storeroom  with  shelves-  broom, dustpan, cleaning cloth or cob-webber

- · After each use, wipe the outside clean.
- · Store the power cord correctly.
- · Clean the inside and all the attachments regularly- follow the manufacturer's instructions.

## Use cleaning equipment safely

Before  using  any  equipment,  take  the  help  of  the instruction manual or ask a senior about the ways of handling of machine. If you don't know how to use the equipment properly, you might:

- · injure yourself
- · injure other people
- · damage  the  equipment  and  whatever  you  are cleaning

## Check before you start work

Before starting any work, check the following:

- · There are no jagged parts or sharp edges on the equipment.
- · Equipment looks clean and presentable.
- · Buckets don't have leaks, are not smelly and have secure handles.
- · You  have  enough  cleaning  cloths,  disposable gloves and other supplies, so that you don't run out of them before your shift ends.
- · You have the right tools and attachments required for  your tasks, you will waste time and effort if you have to go back to the storeroom.
- · The electrical equipment does not have any frayed cords or exposed wires.
- · Any battery-operated equipment is fully charged.

## Cleaning of canteen and kitchen

As this area stores the food items, it requires vigorous and hygienic cleaning. The following areas need special attention while cleaning.

- · Walls
- · Floors
- · Benches

- · Shelves
- · Storerooms, cupboards and almirah
- · Fridges, freezing and cooling rooms
- · Ovens,  stoves  and  cooking  equipment  such  as fryers
- · Extraction fans

## Items used in the food storage and service areas

- · Crockery  and  glassware,  e.g.  plates,  cups  and glassware, hollowware, etc.
- · Cutlery, e.g. knives, forks and spoons
- · Utensils used to cook and serve the food with, e.g. knives, spatulas and rolling pins
- · Cooking containers, e.g. saucepans, frying pans and baking trays
- · Electric equipment such as vertical mixers, meat slicers, graters and grinder
- · Cutting boards
- · Containers or bins or jars to store food before or after it has been cooked
- · Garbage bins

## Cleaning schedule

Before beginning any cleaning task, a schedule or format must be prepared for starting and completion of task in an organised manner, so that the use of chemical and misuse, if any can be identified.

The cleaning schedule will indicate:

- · What to clean?
- · When to clean it?
- · How to clean it?
- · Who cleans it?

Without the schedule, it is difficult to complete the task or sometimes create confusion. Cleaning schedule also  helps  in  maintaining  accurate  records.  Records could be -

- · a  daily  cleaning  worksheet so that the cleaners know what they need to do each day.

- · cleaning  instructions  for  particular  pieces  of equipment  that  explain  exactly  how  to  clean them.

The  cleaning  schedule  has  to  be  prepared  by  the manager  or  supervisor.  It  is  kept  at  a  place  where everyone can see it easily, e.g. next to the roster.

Cleaning  tasks  are  timed  in  a  way  to  create  least disturbance  for staff working  in  the  kitchen. For example, you wouldn't scrub the floor when the chefs are busy unless you have to clean up a spill.

## Follow Safe Work Procedures (SWPs) in the Kitchen Area

Follow Safe Work Procedure to ensure safety and health of  the  workers.  Every  workplace  may  also  have  safe work  procedures  (SWPs)  for  specific  equipment.  They explain exactly how to clean the equipment. Never do the cleaning job of any equipment for which you are not trained.

Equipment such as meat slicers have sharp blades which must be taken apart, thus they can be dangerous to clean. An example of safe work procedure to clean a meat slicer is given below.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Dishes  and  cooking  utensils  can  be  washed  and sanitised by hand or by machine.

## Using a dishwashing machine

Pre-clean the items and utensils by using a high pressure hose to clean off the loose dirt. Then the dishwashing machine  is  used  for  washing,  rinsing,  sanitising  and drying the utensils.

Don't use the dishwasher until you have been trained how to use it. This includes:

- · How to open and close the door?
- · How to stack the dishes correctly?
- · Which detergent to use and how much?
- · How to choose the right washing cycle?
- · How to turn it on and off?
- · How to take out the dishes?
- · How to clean it after use?

## Manual dishwashing procedure

lished

Every workplace follows its own procedures for washing and sanitising the kitchen equipment by hand. Here are some guidelines.

<!-- image -->

| 1. Pre-clean       | ·  Use correct PPE-rubber gloves and a rubber apron.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2. Wash and  rinse | ·  Wash wooden items quickly e.g. rolling pins or wooden bowls. Don't leave  them to soak and dry them quickly. ·  Only wash one sharp knife at a time. Never put them in frothy water                                             |
|                    | because then there is a risk of injury as they are not visible in the froth.                                                                                                                                                       |

## (A) Cleaning kitchen equipment

Kitchen equipment used for food preparation, storage and display should be washed regularly. This includes cleaning  of  stoves  and  ovens,  toasters,  microwaves, salamanders, mixers, exhaust fans, pie warmers, deep fryers and bain maries. You might need to detach the equipment  parts  before  you  wash  it  and  then  put  it back together again. Some general guidelines to clean the equipment:

- · Always turn off and unplug the electrical equipment before you clean it.
- · Always be careful with anything that has sharp edges or blades.
- · Always wear appropriate PPE e.g. gloves, rubber apron, glasses and face mask.
- · For  cleaning  heavy  pressure  stoves  and  ovens, strong chemicals may be needed. Rinse an oven properly to get all the chemicals out of it or it will smell the next time it is turned on.
- · Sanitise  the  equipment  according  to  workplace procedures.

## (B) Cleaning of food storage areas

Food  and  beverage  department  generally  uses  food items, which are perishable, semi perishable and non-perishable. Different items require different types of  storage.  Cleaning  of  this  storage  area  should  be done with specific permitted chemicals and as per the cleaning schedule.

<!-- image -->

## Fridge

It  is  important  for  the  storage  of  cold  items.  It  also extends  the  shelf  life  of  the  food  items.  During  the cleaning process, food items should not be kept at room temperature for more than 30 minutes. The supervisor must always be updated if you see any expired or stale food.

## Cool room

| 1. Pre-clean           | ·  Move food from the cool room to another refrigeration if possible. ·  Remove any food matter or debris on the floor, walls or shelving.   |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2. Wash                | Wash the interior (including shelving and seals) and exterior walls with  a food-grade detergent and hot water.                              |
| 3. Sanitise            | Rinse and sanitise with a food-grade sanitiser.                                                                                              |
| 4. Dry                 | Rinse and allow to air dry.                                                                                                                  |
| 5. Replace food  items | Replace all food items which have been moved out.                                                                                            |

## Defrost the fridge and freezer

If fridges and freezers are defrosted regularly, they will work optimally and use less electricity.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Freezer

It  is  used  for  preservation  of  food  items  for  a  longer time in low temperature (0 to -15° Celsius). Empty the freezer,  then  defrost,  clean  and  sanitise  with  a  foodgrade sanitiser.

## Dry storerooms and cupboards

Cleaning  of  such  food  storage  area  needs  to  be  done regularly because these storage areas provide conducive temperatures  for  the  development  and  survival  of bacteria  as  well  as  insects  and  pests.  If  the  storage cupboards or shelves are made of wood, they must be made up of termite proof board. Also, prior treatment at regular intervals could be done for insects and pests in the storage area.

Storerooms  and  cupboards  need  to  be  cleaned regularly.  Sweep  and  wash  the  floor  at  least  once  a week.  Dust,  clean  and  sanitise  the  shelves  regularly, and clean any spills when required.

While cleaning, always check the following points:

- · anything that has expired
- · anything that is kept in the wrong place

- · anything that has spilled or broken, or come out of its packet
- · signs of pests such as mice, rats, cockroaches or other insects:
- ■ mouse droppings
- ■ chew marks on containers
- ■ moths flying around
- ■ grubs or moths in containers
- ■ spots on walls and surfaces
- ■ eggs and cocoons
- ■ spider webs.

Pests can spread diseases. If you see any of signs of pests, tell your supervisor or pest control department immediately.

## (C) Cleaning of kitchen surfaces

The surfaces in a kitchen include:

- 1. Floors
- 2. Benches
- 3. Walls and ceiling

## Floors

<!-- image -->

Kitchen  floors  get  dirty  very  quickly.  The  grime  of cooking  settles  easily  in  nooks,  corners  and  crevices. They  can  get  slippery  and  dangerous.  They  must  be swept, washed and sanitised at least at the end of the day or shift. They may need to be cleaned at other times of the day too e.g. when food is spilled.

Tip:  Do  not  fill  or  empty  the  bucket  in  the  same sink that dishes are washed  in.  Always  use  the waste sink.

## Guidelines for cleaning the floors

|   1. | Pre-clean   | ·  Put up a 'Wet Floor' warning sign.                                                                                |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    2 | Wash        | ·  Fill a mop bucket with hot water and add detergent. ·  Clean the floor with a rag mop making 'figure 8' movement. |
|    3 | Sanitise    | ·  Get a fresh bucket of warm water and add sanitiser. ·  Mop the floor again.                                       |
|    4 | Dry         | ·  Leave the floor to dry.                                                                                           |

CLEAN PANTRY AND CANTEEN AREA

<!-- image -->

- 5. Clean up
- · Remove the 'Wet Floor' sign after the floor is dry.
- · Wash the mops in hot soapy water and sanitiser, then leave them to air dry.

## Benches

Few  small  organisations  use  such  accessories  for preparation, pre-preparation and storage of food items for  a  limited  time  period.  Cleaning  of  such  benches should be done hygienically because they are the easiest source of contamination of food.

Benches are the space where the food is prepared, so they need to be cleaned all through the day. The chef or any of the assistants in the kitchen may tell you when to clean the benches. At the end of the day or after each shift, the benches need to be thoroughly cleaned and sanitised.

Tip: Stainless steel benches can get scratched easily. Do not use scourers on them.

Some  guidelines  for  cleaning  the  benches  are  as follows:

| 1. Pre-clean   | Take food off the bench and store it away from the cleaning area. Sweep off any crumbs or other food scraps and put them in the bin.   |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2. Wash        | Wipe down with warm water and detergent, using a cloth or sponge.                                                                      |
| 3. Sanitise    | Spray with a food-grade sanitiser. Leave for the time specified by the manufacturer, then wipe off.                                    |
| 4. Dry         | Leave to dry.                                                                                                                          |
| 5. Clean up    | Wash cloths and sponges in hot soapy water and sanitiser, then leave  them to air dry.                                                 |

## Walls and ceilings

<!-- image -->

These  can  be  a  major  source  of  contamination  if  not cleaned  regularly  and  hygienically  since  these  are touched by almost everyone who is moving about in the food production area

Walls  and  ceilings  are  often  washed  each  month, depending  on  how  dirty  they  get  at  each  workplace. Every  workplace  will  have  its  own  procedures.  Some guidelines are as follows:

- · Put up a 'Wet Floor' warning sign. Water may drip onto the floor and make it slippery.

<!-- image -->

- · You  might  need  to  use  a  special  cleanser  and scourers on the greasy walls behind the stoves. Be careful not to damage the paint or the wall.
- · Wash other parts of the wall and the ceiling using a  detergent  or  all-purpose  cleaner  and  a  wall mop. You can then sanitise walls with a spray-on sanitiser.
- · Clean the walls from bottom to top. The bottom of a wall is usually dirtier than the top, so if you work this way the water does not run through the dirt and cause streaking.

## (D) Cleaning of food spillage

Food spillage is one of the major causes of accident in a workplace; it must always be attended to immediately.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## noteS

There is always the potential for a guest or staff member to  be  injured  as  a  result  of  not  cleaning.  Barricading and signage must be put in position before any cleaning begins. 'Slippery when Wet' signs must be used when mopping or working on a slippery surface. There must be enough 'Slippery when Wet signs to provide warning to people who may enter the area from any direction. We have a duty to care and maintain a workplace that does not pose a risk to people, and where we breach that duty resulting  in  injury,  we  can  expect  severe  penalties  to follow. Wipe up any spills as soon as they occur. Clean and then disinfect after wiping up spills from raw food.

Food and drink spill are among the toughest cleaning problems to deal with for a Housekeeping Attendant. It is a common occurrence, yet some do not know the ideal way of dealing with the cleaning of the sudden mess. Not knowing the basics of cleaning up food and drink spills can really put the hotel Attendant at a disadvantage.

Following points are to be kept in mind while cleaning food spillage:

- · Immediately pick up or scoop up the spilled item whether it is liquid or solid, it is important that you pick up or scoop up the excess spillage as much as possible to avoid making the problem worse.
- · If you are dealing with liquid food or drink spills, get  a  clean  sponge  and  absorb  as  much  of  the excess liquid as you can.
- · After  removing  the  excess  food  or  drink  spilled on the rug, the next basic step that you need to do is to blot the area with a clean white cloth or paper  towels.  This  will  help  remove  the  excess moisture and to lessen the chances of it staining the rug. Pouring some warm water onto the stain before blotting will help get you better results in removing the spill or stain.
- · For solid food spills, carefully pick up the loose particles using your hands.
- · Detergent cleaning solutions work great with food and drink stains. When faced with food and drink spills or stains, use a cleaning solution made of

one  teaspoon  of  laundry  detergent  (non-bleach) and a cup of warm water. This is likely to get rid of any stains and spills from food and drinks faster.

## (E) Cleaning of the area near the water cooler

Spilling  of  water  creates  wet  and  dirty  surroundings which creates uneasy working conditions and sometimes  may  cause  accidents  during  work;  such incidents or accidents may be serious and even lead to legal implications.

A water cooler or a dispenser needs regularly cleaning and sanitising. It is recommended that the water cooler be cleaned while changing the filters, or after every six weeks, whichever comes first.

Keeping the water clean is the most important part of maintaining the water cooler. In any case, washing and cleaning water dispenser takes little time. Hence, periodic cleaning of the water cooler is recommended.

Follow the given steps to clean a water cooler:

- 1. Unplug the cooler.
- 2. Check  to  see  if  the  cooler  is  equipped  with  a water guard. This device punctures the caps on the bottles to allow the water to be dispensed.
- 3. If there is a water guard, you need to remove it. Grasp it on both sides and pull it up and out of the cooler. Clean it with a solution of mild detergent and warm water. Rinse thoroughly, and dry with a clean towel.
- 4. Rinse  the  reservoir  out  with  baking  soda  and water  solution,  use  approximately  one  cup  of water and two table spoons of baking soda. Pour it  into  the  reservoir,  drain  it  out  through  the spigots then rinse several times with tap water.
- 5. Replace the water guard kit.

## If sanitising is required:

- 1. Make a solution of ½ tablespoon of bleach in one gallon of water.
- 2. Pour the solution into the reservoir. Do not leave it for longer than five minutes.

- 3. Drain out through the spigot. If you have a hot and cold cooler, do not drain out through the hot side, use cold spigot only.
- 4. Rinse immediately with tap water.

Periodically, remove dirt and lint from the black wire and tube condenser on the back of the cooler. Disconnect the power supply cord, then clean it with the small brush attachment  of  a  vacuum  cleaner.  Regularly  following this procedure will ensure adequate air circulation in the water cooler quality of potable water which would prove to be efficient and economical.

## Importance of safety at workplace

- 5. Secure the waste from animals and pests.
- 6. Empty containers often, dispose waste away as soon as possible and before it starts to smell.
- 7. Wash containers often and thoroughly.
- 8. Wash your hands after handling waste to avoid contamination.

Every workplace has its standard procedures for handling waste, but here are some general guidelines.

## Guidelines for handling bin

Line all rubbish bins with biodegradable trash bags.

Take rubbish out of the kitchen regularly. Don't let the bins overfill.

Tie the top of the bin liner before you dispose of rubbish.

Carry rubbish bins keeping away from your body and clothes.

Use correct PPE.

Wash your hands after handling bins.

## Procedure for cleaning bins

- · Clean up everything that has fallen out of bins onto the floor.
- · Remove the bin liner, with garbage, from the bin. Tie the top and dispose of the garbage correctly.
- · Wipe away loose dirt from outside and inside the bin with a cloth.
- · Scrub  the  outside  and  inside  of  the  bin  and  lid  with detergent and hot water.
- · Wash the area around the bin, such as floors and walls.
- 2. Significant amount of bacteria gets produced in the kitchen waste, which causes food poisoning.
- 3. Waste in the kitchen looks unattractive  and  is unhygienic.

## How to minimise kitchen waste?

- 1. Use the leftover of vegetable and meat whenever possible. For example, use the leftover vegetables for making soups, use potatoes to make mashed potatoes, it helps to reduce food cost as well.
- 2. Avoid overstocking as it leads to generating more food waste.
- 3. Pre-planning of menu (one week in advance) is also advisable.

## Disposal of hazardous waste

Some things used in the kitchen must be disposed of properly or they can pollute (poison) the environment (land, sea, water and air).

Some examples of hazardous waste are:

- · cleaning chemicals
- · corrosive products such  as oven and  drain cleaners
- · used cooking oils
- · aerosol containers
- · insecticides and pesticides such as mouse bait
- · Flammable products (it is against the law to keep methylated spirit at the workplace).

It  must  be  disposed  of  in  an  environment  friendly manner. These substances must never be poured down a  sink  or  the  gully  trap,  put  into  storm  water  drains or thrown out with normal garbage. The actions given hereby must be taken to dispose the hazardous waste materials.

| Hazardous waste                                                                 | How to dispose it                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unwanted concentrated  chemicals, aerosol sprays and  empty chemical containers | Your workplace should have them collected by a  licensed industrial waste company which will dispose  them safely. |

Diluted chemicals e.g. used cleaning water

Pour it down a cleaner's sink with a chemical waste trap that feeds into the sewer system and not the storm water pipe.

Used cooking oil and grease

Your workplace should have it collected in a special kitchen grease trap and a licensed company must be called to take it away.

There  are  laws  about  the  environmentally  safe disposal of chemicals and used cooking oil. Any business that does not follow these laws can be fined and earn a bad reputation.

## Recycled waste

Food courts generate a lot of waste and most food courts provide recycling bins for food and beverage packaging. Plastic  and  glass  bottles  and  aluminium  cans  are disposed in separate bins for recycling. Food packaging and food waste are normally disposed of in the general waste bins.

## Maintaining records for housekeeping duties in kitchen and canteen area

## Indent sheet

Indenting is similar to requisition, which is an interdepartmental  document,  sent  for  requirement  of stationery, food, goods, etc. Indent means a document stating the requirement of goods in terms of description of goods, quality, specifications and the units required. It  is  sent  to  the  store  which  in  turn  processes  the requisition and dispatches the same to the department concerned.

- 11. Customer profile: The description of a customer or set of customers that includes demographic, geographic  and  psychographic  characteristics, as well as buying patterns, creditworthiness and purchase history makes the pattern that creates the  broad  picture  about  the  preferences  of  the customer. This document is very important and it establishes the feasibility of the efforts to be taken by the business. The Housekeeping Department must maintain a copy of this as it has to deal with the customer on day-to-day basis. They must be aware of his preferences and choices. Thus they can work in the right direction towards customer satisfaction.

## Clarity consciousness of report and documents

Every professional work requires documented reporting to  a  person  at  higher  position.  Same is true with the housekeeping  department  also.  The  reports  need  to be prepared and submitted to the authority. This acts as  the  medium  of  professional  communication  from lower to higher position. It also creates the evidence of the work done and also provides the chance to higher authorities to check and make the work error free.

## Clear and concise report writing and documentation

Writing  of  a  report  or  other  document  requires  to  be clear and precise so that the reader understands exactly what is meant. Being concise means to write using short and direct sentences which convey the exact meaning that is intended.

## Use correct pronoun reference

- · Use active voice instead of passive voice
- · Maintain  a  list  of  vocabulary  words  related  to your field of study

## Techniques to write concisely

- · Avoid vague language and meaningless expressions Vague: ' In order to successfully accomplish their job  occupations  and  duties,  the  division  needs
- more work space for some time now.'

Improved: ' The team needs one more workstation space to do its job.'

- · Avoid redundancy or repeating words or ideas
- · Do not overuse prepositional phrases Weak: '  In the near future, at a convenient time, I will be asking for vacation time.' Better: '  I will be requesting vacation time.'
- · Avoid long sentences that confuse the reader

## Report

A  report  is  written  with  a  clear  purpose  and  for  a particular audience. Specific information and evidences are  presented,  analysed  and  applied  to  a  particular problem  or  issue.  The  information  is  presented  in  a clearly  structured  format  making  use  of  the  sections and headings so that the information is easy to locate and follow. Usually a report brief is given first, which provides  you  with  instructions  and  guidelines.  The report  brief  may  outline  the  purpose,  audience  and the  problem  or  issue  that  your  report  must  address, together with any specific requirements for the format or structure. This guide offers a general introduction to report writing; be sure also to take account of specific instructions provided by your department.

An effective report presents and analyses the facts and evidence that are relevant to the specific problem or issue of the report brief. All sources used should be acknowledged and referenced throughout, in accordance with the preferred method of the department.

## Avoiding plagiarism

The style of writing in a report is usually less discursive than that in an essay, with a more direct and economic use of language. A well written report will demonstrate your ability to:

- · understand the purpose of the report brief and adhere to its specifications;
- · gather, evaluate and analyse relevant information;
- · structure material in a logical and coherent order;
- · present  your  report  in  a consistent  manner according to the instructions of the report brief;

## noteS

- · make appropriate conclusions that are supported by the evidence and analysis of the report;
- · Make thoughtful and practical recommendations where required.

## Writing the report

## Essential stages

All reports need to be clear, concise and well structured. The  essential  stages  of  successful  report  writing  are described  below.  Consider  how  long  each  stage  is likely to take and divide the time before the deadline in different stages.

Be  sure  to  leave  time  for  final  proofreading  and checking.

Stage one: Understanding the report brief

Stage two: Gathering and selecting information

Stage three: Organising your material

Stage four: Analysing your material

Stage five:

Writing the report

The structure described below can be adapted and applied to write chapters, sections and even paragraphs.

- 1. Introduce the main idea of the chapter, section or paragraph
- 2. Explain and expand the idea, defining any key terms.
- 3. Present relevant evidence to support your point(s).
- 4. Comment on each piece of evidence showing how it relates to your point(s).
- 5. Conclude  your  chapter,  section  or  paragraph either  by  showing  its  significance  to  the  report as a whole or making a link to the next chapter, section or paragraph.

Stage six: Reviewing and redrafting Stage seven: Presentation

## Feedback

## Occupancy Report

## Report presentation

The  best  way  to  start  that  process  is  to  go  first  to the  end  of  your  report  where  your  conclusions  and recommendations are to be found. Try to mention the report's most essential findings. Keep these to as few points as possible.

## Objective

Start by being clear about your goals. Write down your objective. Make it as clear and concise as you can. Keep it to a few sentences, at most.

## Audience

The  audience  and  their  needs  must  be  identified thoroughly. Judge properly the things that can affect the response. Include what is most expected.

## Road map

Begin by mapping out the logic underlying the presentation,  especially  when  dealing  with  extensive and  detailed  material.  Be  focused  on  the  main  ideas and messages, the conclusions, and recommendations. Points  from  your  report  that  best  support  the  topic should be listed.

## Structure your talk

Address  each  main  idea  as  an  entity,  before  moving on to the next idea. That will help your listeners better comprehend  and  remember  each  key  idea.  Structure the presentation such that you will be able to move on logically, step-by-step, to your conclusion.

## Create a strong opening line

It's  essential  that  you  begin  any  presentation  with  a strong opening line. The strong and interesting opening is  even  more  essential  lest  the  audience  think  they will have to endure a long, tedious exposition. You can quickly dispel any such notion with an opening line that immediately  grabs  everyone's  attention.  So  plan  your opening comments carefully.

## Keep those visuals lean and mean

Chances are your report contains a lot of detailed data. Be on the alert to include only the most essential data in your visuals. As you create your visuals, keep in mind the fundamental rules. Use only at-a-glance visuals that support your key messages. As much as possible, avoid visuals crowded with lots of data, charts, and graphs that add nothing of real value.

## Submission and use of formats in reports

Report should be submitted to the Departmental Head. It should have a standardised format. This makes the Report Interpretation easier.

## Structure of a report

The main features of a report are described below to provide a general guide.

Title page

This should briefly but explicitly describe the purpose of the report (if this is not obvious from the title of the work). Other details to be included could be your name, the date and for whom the report is written.

## Terms of Reference

This heading could include a brief explanation of who will  read  the  report  (audience),  why  it  was  written (purpose) and how it was written (methods). It may be in the form of a subtitle or a single paragraph.

## Summary (Abstract)

The summary should briefly describe the content of the report. It should cover the aims and objectives of the report, what was found and what action, if any, is called for. It should cover about half a page in length and detail or discussion should be avoided; just the main points have to be highlighted.

## Contents (Table of contents)

The contents page lists the different  chapters  and/or headings together with the page numbers.

## Introduction

The introduction sets the scene for the main body of the report. The aims and objectives of the report should be explained  in  detail  here.  Any  problems  or  limitations in the scope of the report should be identified, and a description of research methods, the parameters of the research and necessary background history should be included.

In  some  reports,  particularly  in  science  subjects, separate  headings  for  Methods  and  Results  are  used prior  to  the  main  body  (Discussion)  of  the  report  as described below.

## Methods

Information under this heading may include- a list of equipment used; explanations of procedures followed; relevant information on materials used, including sources  of  materials  and  details  of  any  necessary preparation;  reference  to  any  problems  encountered and subsequent changes in the procedure.

## Results

This section should include a summary of the results of  the  investigation  or  experiments  together  with  any necessary diagrams, graphs or tables of the gathered data that support your result. Present your results in a  logical  order  without  comment.  Discussion  of  your results should take place in the main body (Discussion) of the report.

## Discussion

The main body of the report is where you discuss your material.  The  facts  and  evidence  you  have  gathered should be analysed and discussed with specific reference to  the  problem  or  issue.  If  your  discussion  section is  lengthy,  you  might  divide  it  into  section  headings. Your  points  should  be  grouped  and  arranged  in  an order that is logical and easy to follow. Use headings and subheadings to create  a  clear  structure  for  your material. Use bullet points to present a series of points in an easy-to-follow list. As with the whole report, all sources  used  should  be  acknowledged  and  correctly referenced.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## noteS

<!-- image -->

## Conclusion

In the conclusion, you should show the overall significance of what has been covered. You may want to highlight what you consider to be the central issues or findings. However, no new material should be introduced in the conclusion.

## Appendices

Under this  heading,  you  should  include  all  the  supporting information you have used that is not published. This might include tables, graphs, questionnaires, surveys or transcripts. Refer to the appendices in the body of your report.

For example, in order to assess the popularity of this change, a questionnaire (Appendix 2) was distributed to 60 employees. The results (Appendix 3) suggest that the change is well received by the majority of employees.

## Bibliography

The  bibliography  should  list,  in  alphabetical  order,  all the  published  sources  referred  by  the  author  in  the report. There are different styles of using references and bibliographies. Texts which you consulted but did not refer to  directly  could  be  grouped  under  a  separate  heading such as 'Background Reading' and listed in alphabetical order using the same format as used in the bibliography.

## Acknowledgements

Where appropriate you may wish to acknowledge the assistance  of  particular  organisations  or  individuals who provided information, advice or help.

## Glossary of technical terms

It is useful to provide an alphabetical list of technical terms with a brief, clear description of each term. You can also include explanation of the acronyms, abbreviations or standard units used in your report.

## SeSSion 3: iMpoRtance of indenting in HouSekeeping aReaS

Indenting is similar to requisition, which is an interdepartmental document sent for the requirement of stationery, food, goods, etc. Indent means a document stating the requirement of goods in terms of description of goods, quality, specifications and units. It is sent to the store which in turn processes these and dispatches the same to the department concerned.

Indenting  is  a  procedure  where  the  housekeeping department makes a list of the items required by the department for its functioning and sends it to the stores department. The list is called indent slip and it is usually made once in a week.

## Communicate with Customers and Colleagu es

Communication  is  the  most  important  and  the  most used skill in the hospitality and tourism industry. Being an international industry, the language mostly used is English.  Being primarily a service industry,  most of the communication in the hospitality industry is with the customers. However, the emphasis is on functional communication with customers and colleagues, such as giving and receiving information, providing suggestions or recommendations and dealing with problems. It would be difficult to provide good quality service to customers staying  at  a  hotel  without  communicating  with  them about their expectations, needs and requirements.

Customers need to communicate in order to make reservations for hotels, airlines and restaurants. For example,  when  checking  into  a  hotel, if the communication is not clear with the customer, then the customers might be confused about their room number, location  or  other  rules  of  the  hotel.  This  needs  to  be communicated to them when they check-in. In this unit, we will study about the skills required to communicate with the customers, staff and management.

## SeSSion 1: What iS CommuniCation?

Nowadays  hotel  establishments  have  to  operate  in highly  competitive  accommodation  industry,  which is highly  susceptible  to  external  factors  and  ever changing  customer  expectations. Additionally, the need  to  accurately  anticipate  and  fulfill  the  needs and expectations of guests suggests that it is a very complicated task to manage a hotel or any counter of sales. Due to these and many other factors, managing a hotel inevitably differs from managing other enterprises.

## Communication

Communication  among  employees,  guests  or  people of any organisation plays a vital role. Two-way communication  mostly  occurs  between  two  partiesone is sending and the other is receiving the message. This  results  in  imparting,  conveying  or  exchange  of ideas or knowledge whether by speech, writing or signs. In this, two persons communicate when they transfer information or exchange ideas, knowledge or emotions.

## Importance of communication in the industry

No  hotel  can  perform  well  without  having  effective communication. Effective communication is the result of having good internal as well as external communication.

- 1. It helps in planning and decision making.
- 2. It helps in bringing about coordination.
- 3. It  helps  in  delegation  and  decentralisation  of authority.
- 4. It helps in developing managerial skills.
- 5. It helps in improving employee morale.

## Forms of communication

## Internal communication

This type of communication  takes place between different departmental staffs. This involves exchange of information within the organisation.

Internal communication is of three types:

## (a) Formal communication

This  type  of  communication  involves  transmission  of official  messages or information within or outside the organisation.

## (b) Vertical communication

This  type  of  communication  takes  place  between  a supervisor  and  subordinate  and  vice  versa.  Vertical communication is further classified into two types:

- 1. Downward communication: In this type, information flows from top to lower levels. This  involves  passing  of  instructions  to  the subordinates to do work.
- 2. Upward communication: In this type, information flows from lower levels to higher levels. Usually, it is generally in the form of performance reports, suggestions, reviews, input, feedback, etc.

## (c) Informal communication

This  type  of  communication  is  based  on  informal relations.  Under  it,  some  information  passes  through many individuals

## External communication

This is a communication of hotel with external sources and  officers.  This  may  include  government  agencies, department licensing authorities and other private and government bodies.

## Directions of communication

Communication can travel in two directions. One-way communication  takes  place  in  a  straight  line  from sender to receiver and serves to inform, persuade or command.

<!-- image -->

Two-way  communication  also  includes  feedback from the receiver to the sender and lets the sender know that the message has been received accurately.

## Formal communication in housekeeping department

## Instructions

Following instructions is important for hotel and hospitality staff to make tasks simpler, to ensure that things are done effectively and completely, to eliminate confusion  and  to  save  time.  When  instructions  are properly followed, things work perfectly.

Staff following the instructions shows that they are cooperative, intelligent and reliable, while not following the  instructions  can  lead  to  confusion  and  awkward situations that may end tragically.

When organisation staff does not follow instructions properly,  it  can  cause  chaos  and  great  frustration in  work  and  work  environment.  In  order  to  follow instructions, a person must listen well, read carefully and  ask  questions  and  clarify  if  necessary.  When  a person does not follow instructions, he finds finishing tasks to be much more difficult and complicated. If a single person on a team does not adhere to instructions, then the entire team suffers in various ways. Tasks, if done properly  in  the  first  instance  would  not  require correction or rectification, hence it saves a lot of time and effort.

Following instructions can preserve our health and well being, and it is a necessary skill to lead a quality life. The ability to speak clearly, eloquently, and effectively has been recognised as the ornaments of an educated person since the beginning of recorded history.

## Job order

It  is  a  written  form  of  instructions  to  perform  a  work according to specified requirements, within a specified time frame and cost estimates. A work order is received by an organisation from a customer or client, or it may be  created  internally  within  the  organisation;  it  may differ from organisation to organisation. A work order may be for products or services.

At times, a 'Work Order' is used in place of an  Invoice' ' or  Statement' and presented for payment requests. '

In a service sector, for example, in a hotel, a job order cannot be equivalent to a work or service order where the job order records the location, date and time when the service is carried out and the nature of service that was carried out. The type of personnel (job position) may also be mentioned on the job order. A rate (e.g. Rupees/ hour  or  Rupees/week)  and  also  the  total  amount  of hours worked and the total value is also shown.

## Work target

Work  target  is  the  format  that  respects  and  values the individuality of all the hotel staff and guests in an organisation.  All  business  organisations  should  have written goals that are a part of their business plan. These goals describe what the company plans to accomplish

in  terms  of  market  share,  growth,  development  and profitability.

Goals  may  also  be  set  for  the  purpose  of  internal measurement like expansion of staff or boosting employee morale. Businesses should aim to have goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely. Goal setting means establishing what a person or an organisation wants to achieve.

Motivation is the key component to achieving a target. Organisations  must  consider  performance  targets  for motivating employees, who will in turn perform more effectively.

Performance  targets  are  particularly  useful  due  to their  quantitative  nature,  which  allows  the  measurement of outcomes, output and assessment of operations.

## Benefits of work target management

Work target management is very important for the staff of any organisation. It is based on the objective of the work. In management terms, it is called Management by Objectives (MBO). MBO is related to work target as it:

- (i) Provides  focus: While  setting  any  organisational goal,  first  priority  is  given  to  the  employees,  be it general  employees  or  manager.  This  makes employees to be aware of the area that needs to be focused on in the coming quarter or year.
- (ii) Increases  motivation: Fixed  goals  of  any  organisation gives  employees  the  motivation  to  strive  for  in their  daily  tasks.  Employee  starts  to  work  for profitability.  Set  standards  enable  the  employees to be successful. Awards and recognition should be awarded to employees for achieving the set goals. This can further improve their motivation level.
- (iii) Improves group cohesion: Unity is the best policy for employees working in a team.  No business goals can be reached unless or until employees of all levels work together as a whole to reach the goals. Realisation by employees for working as a group helps them to achieve the goals efficiently.
- (iv) Output: Work output includes the measurement of quantity and quality and efficiency of production

by  companies,  people  and  machines.  Output  is often compared to input, or to the cost to generate the output, to determine the potential profitability of a production process or activity.

- (v) Performance: For  assessing  the  growth  rate,  it  is important  to  do  performance  measurement  and target-setting. These are associated with improving the performance and help in the measurement and analysis of work done.

## Benefits of target-setting

- 1. Target-setting helps in company's growth, work and personal lives
- 2. They can also be useful at an organisational level in  areas  such  as  quotas,  objectives,  deadlines and budgets.
- 3. It helps in improving working performance.
- 4. Breaking  companies'  top  level  objectives  down into smaller targets helps in achieving goals more effectively and efficiently.

## Importance of reports, delay of complaint, repair and AMC schedule

## Importance of a report

Following points highlight the importance of reporting in any communication done in the hospitality organisation:

- 1. Provides information: The report provides information  of  any  incident  taking  place  in  an organisation.
- 2. Helps  in  selection:  Reports  contain  data  and information  and  the  relevant  information  from reports helps in taking appropriate decisions.
- 3. Role in control system: Reports help in checking the actual performance with the budgeted areas.
- 4. Helpful  in  profitable  operations:  Reports  show the direction in which the business is moving and this in turn helps in increasing the profitability.
- 5. Helpful in achieving overall objectives: Motivation received by employees, managers helps in achieving the maximum profit by performing better.

## Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)

To use a machine  effectively and for long time, maintenance plays an important role. For proper and regular maintenance of machines, Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC) is signed with expert companies having the required expertise and skills.

## Benefits of AMC

- · Safe maintenance  work  takes  place  in  good working conditions

## Work schedule

Work schedule refers to the distribution of work among different individuals  in  order  to  carry  out  specific activities according  to a set time and  procedural requirement. The work schedule should be made in such a way that it is easy to understand for the employees. Good  work  schedule  saves  a  considerable  amount  of manager's time, time that may be utilised in performing other management functions.

- 3. It helps in easier training of new operators.
- 4. It helps in reduction in injuries and strain, and a baseline for improvement activities.

## Product knowledge

A  Room  Attendant  must  acquire  a  sound  knowledge of  the  offered  product.  This  helps  in  increasing  the confidence of the employee, raising the level of customer service and also results in a satisfied customer.

## Benefits of product knowledge

- 1. Build stronger communication skills and abilities:  Sound  knowledge  about  the  product helps in communicating the some more effectively and  efficiently,  thereby  enhancing  the  staff's communication skills.

Anticipating  a  customer's  needs  is  significant  for  any organisation to make sure that the customer is satisfied and returns to buy more. Anticipating customers' needs can generate loyal and repeat customers. Staff should be able to anticipate the guests' needs and should be able to serve them before they request for it.

Following  points  are  to  be  kept  in  mind  for  the anticipation of customers' needs:

- · Customer  expectations:  A  customer  is  satisfied only  when  they  receives  service  as  per  their expectations. Satisfied customer gives a profitable repeat business to the organisation.
- · Deliver on promise: Promised or advertised service or products should be delivered on right time. This keeps the guests satisfied and build a loyalty towards the organisation.
- · Think about mistake: Mistakes must be accepted and steps are to be taken for not repeating the mistake  again.  Necessary  apologies  also  help rebuild the customer's confidence.
- · Customer loyalty: Take necessary steps to cater to  the  needs  of  the  customer  and  make  them feel comfortable and special - this would make a happy impression on the customers and they might want to return to the same hospitality service.

## Importance of gender in communication

An  amiable  communication  is  desirable  among  all genders.  It is important  to  deal  with  all persons respectfully  and  equally.  However,  in  some  countries there  could  be  cultural  differences  in  dealing  with persons with different gender roles assigned. For example,  it  might  be  perceived  that  a  woman  speaks more  politely  and  the  men  are  more  assertive  and dominant. However, this would be an individual trait. The parameters for respect, choice of words, gestures and distance to be maintained need to be same for all genders. Please refer to page no. 66 to understand the importance of communication in industry.

## Body language

Body  language  is  another  means  of  communication. It  is  an  important  element  of  communication  skills. Sometimes  it  can  send  signals  stronger  than  words. Body  language  is  controlled  by  one's  subconscious mind,  so  a  reader  can  actually  understand  if  there's a difference in what a person is saying and thinking. In order to ensure that your words and body language complement each other, you need to read and practice regularly and develop a habit of it.

## Impact of body language

Body language plays an essential role in communicating with people. Body language comprises the gestures and movements we make by the different parts of our body while communicating with people. Certainly, the body language must be in sync with the words.

## Points to remember:

- · Never be clumsy or stiff while making movements.
- · Avoid body language that may be misunderstood or look unprofessional, e.g. winking
- · A  consistent  eye  contact  is  a  positive  sign  and must be used.
- · Avoid fiddling with things around. It may distract the attention.
- · Each body part movement signifies something and helps in interpreting. E.g., standing with hands

HOUSEKEEPING ATTENDANT MANUAL CLEANING - C LASS X

on  hips  signifies  aggression,  nodding  signifies agreement and active listening, and biting nails signifies nervousness.

- · Body language does not give time to think. Hence, positivity must be conveyed consciously.

## Why body language is important in communication?

- · Body language can instantly help to evaluate the interest of people.
- · It is a personal way of expressing emotions when words don't help.
- · It can make  the  process of communication interesting and non-monotonous.

## Gestures

There are various gestures that one should avoid while talking  to  the  guests.  There  are  a  few  gestures  that can make you sound more positive and communicate your  agreement  or  disagreement  without  speaking. Some  of  the  negative  and  positive  body  gestures  are suggested here.

## Positive body gestures

Positive  body  gestures  are  a  sign  of  confidence  and security.  They  are  a  sign  of  active  participation  and leave a good impression. Positive gestures include:

- ·
- Walking upright
- · Shaking hands confidently
- · Having a pleasant face
- · Nodding head
- · A steady eye contact

## Negative body gestures

Negative gestures are a sign of insecurity and restlessness. Such gestures show a lack of confidence. Such gestures should be avoided in interviews or meetings.

- · Being stiff or sloppy while standing

## Customer expectation and satisfaction

## Customer satisfaction

Hospitality and customer services are linked to customers' satisfaction because this industry is related to  product,  services  and  customer  satisfaction.  Now, customers'  requirements  can  be  both  tangible  and intangible but satisfying all of them and hence meeting their requirements  is  called customer  satisfaction. Exact products or service features customer emotions, attributions for service achievement,  perception  of impartiality or fairness and price are some factors which influence customer satisfaction.

## Customers' expectations

The  customers'  expectations  can  be  known  only  by keeping yourself in customers' shoes. Following are the important expectations that a customer would want in a sales or hotel organisation:

- 1. Attention towards the customer
- 2. Good and competent service

This can be achieved only if there is good coordination and communication amongst staff of the hotel.

Communication problems at a workplace can affect hotel productivity and income. Without efficient communication, an organisation is unable to exchange information  essential  for  daily  operations.  Understanding the issues related to workplace communication can help you to create policies that will address the problems and create an efficient communication network in the hotel. Results of improved communication skills in any hotel or hospitality organisation are as follows:

- 1. Improved customer service
- 2. Better  understanding  of  the  instructions  from supervisors among the staff members
- 3. Great  understanding  of  the  latest  technology used by an organisation
- 4. Boost up and build confidence to approach guests
- 5. Positive attitude towards  the  workplace  and higher level of understanding between the department heads

Speaking language can sometimes differ  amongst  employees  at  a  workplace,  resulting  in a  communication  problem.  There  might  be  language barriers between people of different ethnic backgrounds, people of different ages and people with different levels of  industry  experience.  Any  language  barrier  is  might slow down the communication process or create misunderstandings that make communication ineffective.

## noteS

- People may refuse to communicate based on their personal dislikes and disagreement, and this may damage the company's ability to do business and slowdown the growth of the organisation.
- 3. Lack of feedback: Feedback is an important part of completing the communication of any message. The receiver must communicate the feedback in response to the message received by him.

## Guidelines for handling guest complaints

Staff should keep the following guidelines in mind while handling guest complaints:

- · The guest complaining the problem may be quite angry  and  thus  hotel  staff  should  not  make promises that is beyond their authority.
- · Be  honest  with  the  guest  when  dealing  with complaints. If the guest's problem is taking time to be resolved or cannot be solved, admit it to the guest in the beginning only.
- · For dealing with the guests having complaining nature,  hotel  staff should  develop  a  specific approach.

## Procedure for handling guest problems

One of the greatest challenges in the hospitality industry is to satisfy an angry guest and resolve their complaints.

Some tips are given here to resolve guest problems:

- 1. Communication: Be polite and never argue with the guest
- 2. Listening: Listen to the guest complaint first so that the guest feels that their problem is being considered.
- 3. Recognition: Staff  should  recognise  the  guests and their complaints.
- 4. Empathy: Always show empathy towards guest inconvenience.
- 5. Job  skills  and  knowledge: Promise  the  guest that the best possible action would be taken to resolve the problem or call the superior to attend the problem.

- 6. Problem  solving  and  feedback: Make  sure  that the problem gets resolved and feedback should be taken from the guest.

## Feedback

Feedback means  describing useful information or criticism about the prior action or behaviour from an individual,  communicated  to  another  individual  (or a  group)  who can use that information to adjust and improve the current and future actions and behaviours.

Feedback in Hospitality Management can be either positive  or  negative.  Steps  must  be  taken  to  improve upon the aspects which fetch negative feedback. Positive feedback  produces  repeat  clientele  and  encourages word-of-mouth  publicity  which  goes  a  long  way  to promote the hotels' ratings.

## Importance of feedback

Feedback in any communication channel is an important step; communication cannot be said as complete without taking the feedback.

- 1. Feedback is effective listening: Customers' valuable feedback shows that the customer has been  received  well  and  the  problem  has  been resolved.
- 2. Feedback can motivate: Employee taking feedback from the guest can get self motivated to perform better.
- 3. Feedback  can  improve  performance: Feedback helps in taking better decisions to improve the performance.

## Etiqu ette a nd Hospitable Conduct

ea

The responsibilities of hospitality staff include receiving customers, answering their queries, noting down their food  and  beverage  orders  and  communicating  the orders to kitchen, instructing the kitchen staff, serving food to customers and helping maintain the eatery as per organisational policy. This job role is applicable to hotels,  hospitals,  canteens,  food  kiosks,  food  courts and cafe, etc.

All staff working in hospitality industry should have proper  etiquettes,  manners  and  hospitable  conduct while dealing with the guest. When guests arrive at a hotel,    restaurant,  guesthouse  or  an  event,  they  will expect and want to be treated with courtesy and respect. This is where a good grounding in proper etiquette is important for workers in the hospitality industry.

In this context, etiquettes do not refer to things like receiving of guests and communicating with the guest. Instead,  it  refers  to  knowledge  of  the  prevailing  local cultural norms that would govern interaction between people. For example, workers in the hospitality industry in different states of the country or in different countries must  know  the  proper  way  to  greet  their  customers. Also, the interaction with guests would somewhat differ in  formal,  official  setups  as  compared  to  informal, family functions. By doing so, they will be able to give

the guests the sort of experience that they expect and in which they will be comfortable.

Good  manners  and  etiquettes  are  guidelines  to behave in all social situations. Etiquette is just like a code  of  conduct.  The  aim  of  following  etiquettes  and manners in Hospitality Industry is to provide happiness and satisfaction to the guests.

## Goal of hospitality

Hospitality is the only industry that considers customer as  a  guest  and  the  guest  as  the  boss.  When  a  guest is paying for the products and services he avails, then the guest's satisfaction becomes of utmost importance. Industry  experts  consider  customer  satisfaction  as  a tool for repeat business and guest loyalty. Guests are of varying age, gender, social status, occupation, culture, religion,  language,  etc.  Considering  all  the  variables, ultimately  hospitality  targets  the  satisfaction  of  the guest.

## noteS

## Need of hospitality and hospitable conduct

Earlier, sarai (inn) and dharmashala functioned as per their individual codes  of conduct.  As  the hospitality industry grew into motels, hotels and large establishments, the need for a common code of conduct emerged.  A  common  procedure  to  receive  guests  and entertain them arose. Hospitality is all about making a traveler as comfortable as possible away from home.

Hospitality becomes a necessity for those who travel for  various  reasons  like  education,  tourism,  medical treatments,  religion,  business  and  trade.  The  people moving away from their residence for any reason need to  fulfill  the  basic  requirements  of  food,  clothing  and shelter. They also need amenities which can entertain them and provide pleasure. All these requirements are to  be  provided  by  somebody  who  is  available  at  the required time and place with the required arrangements.

A unique feature of this industry is that any person working here is likely to come in contact with the guest. Thus, there must be a code of conduct for all. When you behave in a proper manner or follow the code of conduct or standard of professionalism, it attracts the guests and builds customer relation leading to customer satisfaction.

The hospitable conduct teaches us how to communicate, how to behave, how to present yourself and how to present food to the  guests.  The  image  of any hospitality organisation depends upon not only the individual staff member but also the entire team.

## Customer as a guest

A customer  is  a  person  or  organisation  that  uses economic services or commodities belonging to others. Hospitality is not just a business but has become an industry now. It deals with customer satisfaction but needs to pay the employees their salaries, earn profits and sustain competition. Customer has to pay for the services  they  avail.  Thus,  a  customer  is  a  guest  for hospitality  industry  and  hence  avails  the  hospitality

services  on  payment  basis.  Therefore,  the  customer (guest) satisfaction becomes important for hospitality, in order to generate and sustain business.

## Customer centricity in hospitality

Hospitality  functions  entirely  around  the  customer (guest).  Though  the  customers  like  to  be  recognised and addressed with their name and feel happy if the staff shows a friendly approach towards them. However, there  is  a  thin  line  difference  between  being  friendly and being familiar. The customer wishes that he should be recognised and that the staff be familiar with him, his likes, dislikes, etc. However, it gets annoying and uncomfortable if the staff gets over-friendly and starts invading the guest's personal space.

## To avoid this, you must:

- · never  get  too close to customers  physically. Maintain an arm distance at all times.
- · not ask personal questions.
- · not  suggest  or  recommend  regarding  personal choices.
- · not comment on family or personal issues.
- · not discuss your personal matters with them.

You should be polite and clear so that the other person can understand the communication easily and clearly.

## Answering the phone

Answer  the  phone  according  to  the  time  of  the  day and  the  name  of  the  department.  After  the  greeting,

inquire politely, 'How can I assist you?' or 'How may I help you?'.

## Taking messages

When taking a message for someone else, always politely ask 'I am sorry, Mr. Sharma has gone out. May I take a message?' or 'I am sorry he is busy at the moment, may I take your name and number and the concerned person will call you back.'

In case you are not comfortable giving information or do not have the information, then politely say, 'I am sorry I do not know but I would be happy to pass on the message to the concerned person.'

Always pass on the message to the concerned person with the name, number and calling time so that the call can be returned and the information provided. Even if the person on the other end is demanding and brusque, continue to be polite in your interaction.

## Greeting customers

While greeting customers, the housekeeping staff should use this language:

- · Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening Sir/Madam
- · Welcome to our hotel.
- · Can I help you? How may I help you?
- · Do you have a reservation?
- · May I ask you if you have a reservation?

## While taking clients to the table

- · Come with me
- · This way, please
- · Here you are.
- · Will this table/room be alright?

## Body Language, Body Posture and Gesture

In the hospitality industry, no two guests or VVIPs have the same attitude or behaviour, so your body language while dealing with them is very important.

Body  language  implies  non-verbal  movement(s)  or gestures made by one or many body parts consciously

ETIQUETTE AND HOSPITABLE CONDUCT

or  unconsciously  while  interacting  to  communicate one's feelings or attitude. It could be by way of facial expressions, hand movements, facial expressions, etc.

Following are the components  of correct body language:

## Make eye contact and have the correct posture

- · As soon as a guest arrives in the restaurant and conversation begins, you should always maintain eye contact and pay attention.
- · Make sure the customer feels comfortable. Never stare  at  the  customer.  Make  sure  to  blink  and look away at regular intervals.
- · If a customer talks about an experience, an issue or a product, nod  your  head  to  show  you understand and agree with your body language. However, while nodding keep your facial expression relaxed so that the customer does not think that you are annoyed.
- · Avoid using mobile phones or tablets during the conversation.

## Give a warm smile

As you are at the first point of contact for the customer, always  wear  a  genuine  smile  to  show  positivity  and trustworthiness.  Do  the  same  during  departure.  This ensures that the customer leaves in a happy mood.

## Use friendly gestures

- · Gestures are verbal or non-verbal ways to express or show an idea and emotions. For example, hand movement,  movement  of  the  whole  body,  facial expressions, head movement, etc.
- · Gestures  are  often  used  along  with  a  verbal message. Isolated gestures convey one message while gesture clusters convey myriad expressions in several gestures.
- · Use  your  hands  to  convey  a  cordial  gesture during  a  conversation.  These  light  up  thoughts and improve your creative thinking.

## Tone of voice

- · The voice of a person usually enables the listener to  not  only  identify  the  gender  of  the  speaker but also their emotional state and  cultural background. E.g., happy, excited, angry, worried, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi, etc.
- · The tone of voice  is  an  important  mode  of  emotional expressions.

## Read customer emotions

- · It is a  widely  accepted  fact  that  although  a person might be able to hide anxiety and stress by controlling the body posture and facial expressions,  but  in  most  cases  the  movement of  the  person's  legs  and  feet  reveals  the  true emotional state.
- · Manual Cleaning staff should have the ability to read  a  person's  state  of  mind  by  observing  the foot movements. It will help in serving and dealing with the customers better.

## Use  of  Proper  Language  and  Politeness  in Customer Dealing

- · Hospitality is an area where worker has to deal with  customers  having  proficiency  in  different languages, accent, voice and pronunciation. The manual cleaning staff should be able to use language properly while talking to the guest.
- · The  staff  should  be  able  to  speak  clearly  and understand clearly what the customer is saying and ordering.
- · Staff should be able to construct simple and small sentences in more than two languages.
- · Clear speech and speaking good functional English is a valuable asset for any person working in the hospitality industry.

## noteS

Office manners and proper office conduct is needed to do office jobs. Office manners are closely associated with work behaviour. A person working in an organisation should follow office manners and behave like a highly skilled professional.

## Customer Grievances and Complaints

A grievance is resentment over something believed to be wrong or unfair. In the hospitality industry, grievances and  complaints  are  used  positively  to  improve  their products and service qualities, attain customer satisfaction and customer attention.

## Reasons for guest grievances

- 1. Absence of friendliness in staff.

- 1. When a guest arrives, approach and greet with a smile on your face, make eye contact and keep good body posture.
- 2. Greet  the  guest  with  a  'good  morning',  'good afternoon'  or  'good  evening'  depending  on  the time of day.

## Brand Value of Company

Brand value is the asset of every company. It carries and  conveys  the  image  of  a  company  or  product, service  or  person  created  on  a  customer's  mind.  In today's  competitive  world  when  there  remains  less non-distinguishable difference between two same products of different companies, it becomes  very difficult  to  communicate  better  quality  of  a  proposed product  to  a  customer.  Brand  is  an  image  that  gets embossed on a customer's mind. Whenever a customer comes across a brand name, he relates it to a certain product,  company  or  service  for  which  the  brand  is being used. The manual cleaning staff comes directly in contact with the customer, i.e. they are the ones the customer sees frequently. Their manners and etiquette add to the brand value of the company or services that are offered.

## Customer Loyalty Programme

Customer  loyalty  is  directly  related  to  organisational existence and growth, which is a direct result of happy, satisfied  and  loyal  customers.  If  a  customer  is  happy and  satisfied  with  the  services,  they  will  definitely become a repeat customer, thereby spending time and money for your organisation. A satisfied customer is the most  effective  word-of-mouth  publicity  representative

## noteS

## noteS

for your hotel. As against the publicity measures taken by  the  hotel  itself,  the  word-of-mouth  publicity  done by customers is far more effective since it immediately conveys  credibility  and  quality  of  your  hotel.  This, therefore, draws in greater number of new customers along with increasing the number of repeat customers. Hence, the loyalty of customers is always beneficial to both the company and other stakeholders. It is advised that the company gives privilege and/or rewards to such loyal customers. It is a well-known fact that acquiring new customers on your own is more difficult as compared to retaining the existing customers and converting them into loyal customers. Points to be considered to create a loyal customer are:

- 1. Be  honest  and  generous  to  the  customer: If in  an  organisation,  employees  are  honest  and careful in customer  dealing,  it gives repeat business and loyal customers.
- 2. Be  thankful  to  the  customer: Customers  are business-giver, so be honest while dealing, submitting bills to the customer, helping him in planning local visits and establish a relationship with  the  customer.  If  this  happens,  always  be thankful to the customer or guest.
- 3. Develop loyalty programmes for the company: Development  of  such  programmes  differ  from organisation to organisation, to promote business and generate loyal customers, every organisation must have such programme. Such programmes may start from giving discount to offering other benefits.

## Special attention guests

There  are  a  few  guests  who  need  to  be  given  special attention.  These  are  ladies,  infants,  small  children, elderly,  handicapped  or  disabled,  foreign  guests  and guests  having  medical  or  health  issues.  Such  guests should  be  given  special  care  and  help  as  per  their specific requirements. The special attention guests are categorised as SPATT.

Following points should be kept in mind while giving special attention to the guests:

- 1. Escort the guest to the guest table or room and help them to be seated.
- 2. Offer them a seat and make them comfortable.
- 3. Serve the elder guest first with care and respect and ask for any special assistance.
- 4. Anticipate  the  guests  for  their  special  needs, problems or disabilities.
- 5. Young or infant guests should be treated differently.  Use  a  friendly  tone  to  familiarise with  the  child.  Ask  if  there  is  any  special requirement.
- 6. Provide a wheelchair for the specially-abled guest, if required, and seat them in an area that is easy to access.
- 7. Offer  escort  to  a  visually  impaired  guest  and serve them with special attention.
- 8. Use sign language with a guest having hearing impairment.
- 9. Use  a  common  language  to  communicate  with foreign guest or use a translator.
- 10. Guests with health issues should be served food according to their need.

## SeSSion 4: gain inSigHt into CuStoMer SatiSfaCtion

Customer satisfaction is a prime factor in the hospitality industry and the industry endeavours to focus especially on customer satisfaction which is created on the basis of  F&amp;B  services,  housekeeping  and  accommodation arrangements.

The  main  task  of  customer  service  department  is to  provide  best  possible  products  and  services  and always be actively involved in customer interaction and satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is a way to ensure customer retention and repeat business.

Customer satisfaction is a complex process. Satisfaction in the service industry can be enhanced on the basis of guest review. It is the duty of the hospitality staff to collect negative and/or positive feedback from the guests and pass them on to the customer service department or section.

Customer satisfaction is based on customers' experience and their overall experience with the service provider and is also the result of services.

The  maximum  interaction  of  customers  with  F&amp;B and housekeeping staff takes place in the hotel rooms and the dining area. As such, most of the assessment of customer satisfaction is derived in these two sections.

Customer's satisfaction is influenced by two factors: experiences and expectations with the service provider. Satisfaction is thought of as overall customer attitude towards a service provider. Customer satisfaction is the accumulated experience of a customer's purchase and consumption experience.

## Factors that Build Customer Satisfaction

There are three important factors that build customer satisfaction:

- 1. Price
- 2. Quick service
- 3. Atmosphere

## Guests are mostly dissatisfied for the following reasons

- 1. Insufficient parking availability near hotels.
- 2. Cleanliness and ambience of the hotel.
- 3. Size  of  the  room  and  layout  of  the  furniture therein.
- 4. Frequency and quality of housekeeping services.
- 5. Unavailability of food variety. A greater variety of food, products and services attracts more customers and serves the expectations of many customers.
- 6. Quality of food is another important factor. Poor food  quality  results  in  bad  customer  feedback and loss of customer base. Food quality matters a lot when it comes to processed food, so it must be served fresh.
- 7. Unavailability of professional staff.
- 8. Poor service quality.
- 9. Poor etiquettes and manners of staff.
- 10. Not  anticipating  the  guest  needs  and  fulfilling them.
- 11. Not handling the guest complaints properly.

## Brand Value of a Company

Hospitality organisation like hotels and resorts need to maintain their brand value all the time. It is the brand value of the organisation that lets the customer to take the  decision  to  visit  a  particular  hotel.  Good  brand value can easily get customer trust through customer satisfaction.

Any hospitality organisation can enhance the brand value  by  customer  satisfaction  by  following  certain practices like (Fig. 4.5):

<!-- image -->

## Maintaining the needs and wants of customer

To keep the customer satisfied all the time, it is a good practice to identify and fulfil the customer expectations. For example, a customer may want a personalised car parking service attendant in a hotel and this need can be fulfilled by valet service offered by the hotel staff.

## Loyal to the customer

Building a trust with customers is a good practice as customers  always  want  to  communicate  with  trusted

employees or staff. It is the duty and responsibility of the hotel staff to maintain customer trust all the time.

## Offering value for money product or service

Value for money product or service refers to a product that meets the customer needs and is within a reasonable price or cost. For example, a customer wanting to have two single beds for two persons in a limited budget can be offered a twin bedroom within a customised pocket friendly price.

## Maintain the quality of the product

It  is  the  responsibility of the hospitality staff to make sure that all the products and services offered to the customer  is  of  highest  quality.  Quality  here  refers  to maintaining  the  standard  of  the  offered  product.  For example, product like guestroom offered to a customer needs high standard of maintenance and cleanliness.

## Provide correct information

Never give a false promise or incorrect information to the  customer.  If  you  are  not  able  to  provide  correct information or solution to the guest query, always call the  superior  staff.  For  example,  if  an  in-house  guest asks  for  the  information  of  the  city  and  you  are  not aware of it, you can take the help of senior colleagues to give correct information instead of providing incorrect information.

## Maintain good relationship with the customers

To  get  a  repetitive  customer  for  a  long  time,  it  is  a good  practice  to  offer  various  discounts,  benefits  or complimentary  services  like  valet  service  or  laundry service during their stay to the customer. These activities help in retaining the customer for a long time and add to the profit of the organisation.

## Gender and Age Sensitive Service

Practices

All service industries need to follow a standard of Gender and Age parity in both - providing the service or catering to  a  client.  The  vertically  typical  'Gender  Pyramid'  is prevalent  almost  everywhere,  with  women  dominance in  low-level  and  less  remunerative  jobs  coupled  with less  career  development  opportunities  as  opposed  to men who  occupy most of the top level and managerial positions.  Till  very  recently,  transgenders  almost  had no major role to play in any industry, specially in India. The deeply entrenched beliefs and stereotyped attitude towards different genders in general and specifically at the workplace are the main barriers in gender equality.

Though India is a fast developing country, yet gender bias between the two major genders - male and female prevails  prominently. In this unit, focussing on these two genders we will learn about the disparities met out against  the  female  gender,  who  constitute  more  than half of its demographic population.

You  will  also  study  gender  and  age  sensitivity  in Indian tourism and hospitality industry.

Status  of  women  in  a  society  gets  reflected  in  the roles played by them in its institutions such as family, political or other  social  groups.  In  the  hospitality industry  also,  women  hold  more  positions  of  power

## Notes

now than in the past. Indian hospitality industry also shows the same pattern. But compared to their share in  population,  women  hold  fewer  positions  compared to  males.  This  is  in  spite  of  a  number  of  measures taken by the government through legislation and policy measures.

## sessioN 1: WomeN's Rights aNd Respect at WoRkplace

Women's rights in the workplace include many facets, such  as  the  right  to  work  during  pregnancy.  An employer cannot exclude a woman from a position due to  pregnancy  as  long  as  she  can  carry  out  her  tasks satisfactorily.  The  employers  must  not  deny  hiring  a person on the basis of gender. Care should be taken that a woman employee of an organisation is not exposed to sexual harassment of any kind. This includes ensuring that an antagonistic work environment does not exist at the workplace where a woman is subjected to sexual comments,  touching,  as  well  as  unwanted  sexual advances that put her under fear of losing her job if she does not comply. All such advances should be reported to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or to the supervisor. Any gender can be appointed at any job role in an organisation. As the financial status of women increases, so does the welfare of their families, children and the nation.

## Gender Issues at Workplace

In most of the organisations, sexual harassment is  one  of  the  major  problems  and  issues  faced  by working women.

## What is sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can be described as any unwelcome sexual conduct on job that creates a frightening, hostile or offensive working milieu. For any kind of verbal or physical  action  or  gesture  done  by  a  male  towards  a female  which  makes  a  woman  uncomfortable  and embarrassed amounts to sexual harassment.

## Company's policies to prevent sexual harassment

It is the responsibility of the owner and/or management of every organisation or company  to  provide  and maintain  a  workplace  that  is  free  of  potential  sexual harassment of women employees. Not only is it a legal obligation on the employers, but it also reflects a good business  sense.  If  sexual  harassment  at  workplace exists, it would not only lead to poor employee morale but  also  low  productivity  and  legal  implications.  Any kind of gender discrimination and sexual harassment of women is prohibited by law.

## Strategies for prevention

The most effective weapon against sexual harassment is  prevention.  The  responsibility  of  preventing  sexual harassment  rests  on  the  employer.  Employers  are, therefore, required by law to take steps to prevent and deal with harassment at the workplace. The employer may be held liable for any harassment which occurs at workplace,  even  if  unaware  that  the  harassment  was taking place.

Following are the ways that can be adopted to reduce the risk of sexual harassment at a workplace such as:

## Vishaka guidelines

'  Vishaka Guidelines' are a set of procedural guidelines used in India in case of sexual harassment. They were promulgated by the Indian Supreme Court in 1997 and were  superseded  in  2013  by  The  Sexual  Harassment of  Women  at  Workplace  (Prevention,  Prohibition  and Redressal)  Act,  2013.  The  judgement  laid  down  the guidelines making it mandatory for every employer to provide a mechanism to redress grievances pertaining to workplace sexual harassment and enforce the right to gender equality of working women.

## Adopt a clear sexual harassment policy

In  the  employee  handbook,  there  should  be  a  policy devoted to sexual harassment.

## Notes

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Notes

That policy should:

<!-- image -->

- · define sexual harassment
- · state  in  certain  terms  that  company  will  not tolerate sexual harassment
- · state that the company will discipline or fire any wrongdoers
- · set out a clear procedure for filing sexual harassment complaints
- · state  that  the  company  will  investigate  fully  on any complaint that it receives, and will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who complains about sexual harassment.

## Train employees

Yearly training sessions must be conducted for employees to  endow them with education and information about harassment  on  regular  basis  to  make  it  clear  that harassment will not be tolerated at the workplace.

## Train supervisors and managers

Yearly training sessions for supervisors and managers must  be  conducted  apart  from  the  regular  employee sessions. These sessions should educate the managers and supervisors about sexual harassment and explain how to deal with complaints. Develop an antiharassment policy together with the employees, managers and union representatives.

The  policies  must  be  communicated  to  all  the employees, and management or employer must assure that  all  the  managers  and  supervisors  understand their responsibility to provide a harassment-free work  environment.  Employers  should  also  provide  a mechanism  for  addressing  sexual  harassment  in  a confidential and sensitive manner after a grievance has been filed.

## Facilities for women available at work

The  facilities  which  are  of  significance  in  context  of women safety at workplace, those must be provided by the employer not only in hospitality sector but in every sector. These can be listed as given hereby.

HOUSEKEEPING ATTENDANT MANUAL CLEANING - CLASS X

## Transport facilities

Transport  facility  to  commute  between  the  residence and  workplace  is  provided  to  women  employees  as an  important  safety  measure.  As  employee  security is  of  paramount  importance,  the  following  measures are  generally  put  in  place  to  oversee  the  security  of female employees who are required to travel for official purposes early morning or late evening. Such policies are  applicable  to  all  the  female  employees  who  have to  report  to  work  for  official  reasons  early  morning, i.e. before 6:30 a.m. or required to work till late in the evening, i.e. after 7:30 p.m.

## Basic guidelines

- · Transport  arrangement  is  made  for  the  female employees working in 24*7 operations or as per the approval of respective department heads.
- · The roster should be devised so as to ensure that the last drop is not of any female employee.
- · A security guard of the company must escort the vehicle in which any female employee is Travelling.
- · All the guards escorting company employees must be provided with a mobile phone and emergency contact numbers.
- · Every  company  shall  establish  an  emergency contact number, which shall be monitored by the Administrative Department.
- · All  cabs  provided  by  the  company  shall  prominently display an emergency helpline number.
- · Admin department shall conduct regular briefings for the drivers on code of conduct to be followed while on duty.

## Reporting abuse

It is for the employer to create a positive atmosphere at the workplace where a woman is encouraged to come to work, feeling secured with the knowledge that she will be  treated  with  dignity,  respect  and  will  be  protected from harassment. At the time of orientation, all women in an organisation must be made aware of their rights, facilities  and  actions  that  they  can  initiate  regarding sexual harassment. All organisations must have a Code

A  sexual  harassment  committee must be set up for reporting to the Managing Director or  a  senior  member  of  the  management  and  headed by a woman. Strict disciplinary action must be taken against  those  found  violating  the  code  of  conduct  to ensure that it is not repeated. Organisations with panIndia presence should have regional heads as members of the committee.

The  majority  or  at  least  two  women  should  be on  the  committee,  one  from  the  staff  and  one  from management. Every office should have a representative reporting  to  the  committee.  Every  complaint  verbal or written must  be  documented  and  investigated promptly  by  the  committee  and  appropriate  action must be taken irrespective of the person being a senior, supervisor,  colleague,  staff,  customer  or  vendor.  In smaller organisations, an external sexual harassment committee should be appointed.

## Maternity leaves

Women employees should have minimum 80 working days  to  her  credit  in  last  12  months  counting  from the start of maternity leave to be eligible for maternity benefits in that organisation. This law also states that all  the  working  women  are  entitled  for  minimum  12 weeks of maternity leave. And at most six weeks leave may be taken before the day of delivery. A Casual Leave (CL) may or may not be clubbed with maternity leave. There rules will vary from organisation to organisation. Large public limited companies,  public  or private sector banks and large private sector companies grant maternity  leaves  to  their  women  employees,  varying from  90  days  to  180  days.  Some  organisations  also permit their women employees to extend the leave up to one year (with or without pay). They even provide the facility to cover childbirth expenses in a good hospital for all the employees.

## Working hours

Indian law does not allow working of female employees beyond  acceptable  hours  after  7:00  pm  in  factories

and commercial establishments. The employer should understand  that  working  beyond  permissible  hours can only be done on rare occasions and not as a norm. Any  deviation  from  this  requires  prior permission of government authorities. Such permissions are conditional and impose restrictions and duties on the employer  aimed  at  ensuring  security  of  the  female employees. Arranging for safe transportation facilities for female employees who are working beyond permissible hours is mandatory. Non-adherence of such conditions attracts penalties.

## Safety measures for female employees

Following  are  the  basic  safety  measures  which  are essential for women's safety at workplace:

## CCTV cameras

Though  the  workplace  may  be  a  secure  area,  other common usage places  such  as,  washrooms,  smoking areas  and  cafe  areas  may  pose  threat.  One  simple measure which is commonly adopted for this is CCTV. The CCTV surveillance at common places is essential. A CCTV must be placed on the way to the restroom. Proper lights are needed and all the doors should have proper latches, etc. A female security guard staff is also required near the toilet.

## Lockers

<!-- image -->

To  keep  the  personal  belongings  safely,  safe  deposit lockers  or  cabinets  are  provided  to  every  staff  in  the ladies restroom. The restrooms are facilitated with basic facilities such as dressing tables, couch to rest during breaks, changing room, and alarms and fire extinguisher in case of any emergency. The way leading towards the restroom  or  locker  room  has  to  be  kept  under  CCTV surveillance for security reasons.

## Anti-sexual harassment committee

It is the legal responsibility of every employer to provide a workplace free of sexual misconduct with its women employees.  As  such,  in  every  organisation,  an  antiharassment  committee  is  constituted  which  forms

the policies to set forth a detailed mechanism by which female  employees  can  make  complaints  when  facing sexual harassment.

## Women's helpline

As  an  effective  safety  measure  for  female  employees, women helpline numbers are also displayed in common public  areas  such  as  washrooms,  cafeterias,  etc.,  so that these can be displayed in case of emergency as and when required. A national women's helpline is a service provided  specifically  to  serve  only,  or  predominantly, women victims of violence.

## Safety and security for female travellers

As per industry experts, 10-18 per cent of their guests comprise  of  single  women  travellers.  In  India,  hotels have begun understanding that single women traveller is a fast growing, niche market and has a tremendous potential  in  India.  Hotels  that  often  perceive  their customers as only men could be losing a lot of clientele if their practices or facilities are not tailored to suit the female  customers.  With  the  change  in  trends,  where more  and  more  women  are  now  travelling  for  official work trips outside the comfort zone of their home and cities, safety and security is of utmost priority. Hotels have now started becoming more considerate towards this aspect and are adopting various methods to ensure good service for the guests. Hence, specially designed programmes for single ladies help the hotels to assure their lady guests a safe and sound environment.

The  basic  guidelines  adopted  at  various  hotels  for providing a safe and secure environment for a female traveller are:

- · Never allocate a lone female a room on the first floor  as  gaining  access  to  rooms  on  first  floor and escaping after committing a crime is easier as compared to higher floors. It is a policy of all hotels and accommodation set ups.
- · When allocating a room to a single female, try to allocate a room located in the middle of the floor.
- · Lone female travellers can be automatically upgraded to the next available room type.  Mostly,

in  good  hotels,  women  are  allotted  rooms  with tariff or facilities higher than they are paying for, in view of safety.

- · Offer escort service from hotel car parking, especially at night.
- · Provide well lit, on-site car parking with CCTV, if possible.
- · Never read out lone female's room number when checking in, just point out the room number on the registration card (applies for other customers, too).
- · Make lone females aware that all the rooms have peep holes on doors for added security.
- · Never  give out  lone female's name  or  room numbers.
- · Bedside lighting controls provided as per standard in all the rooms.
- · As far as possible, women attendants should be put to render service in rooms occupied by lone ladies.  Similarly,  men  attendants  should  serve rooms occupied by lone men or group of men.
- · Health and safety guidelines in place for staff on non-harassment of lone female guests.
- · Lone female guests should not be seated around the edge of the dining room facing the entrance.

As such, they are more likely to spend their  free  time  socialising  with  people  of  similar  age, and on leisure. Senior citizens present in the country deserve special attention from the hoteliers especially considering that they have more time to spend socialising with their peers after retirement.

family. Hotels are starting to realise that when it comes to travel decisions, women are really influential. 'Thus, all hotels across the globe are focusing on facilities for young or single women travellers. A few women-friendly facilities which are offered at luxury hotels across India are discussed here.

- · Exclusive floor(s) for ladies, where each room is equipped with a security camera that allows the resident  to  see  who  is  outside  the  door  before opening.
- · For single lady travellers, the hotel service ensures that  they  receive  rooms  closest  to  the  elevator, and that their requests are delivered by women executives.

## Unique Needs and Wants of Guests

Guests visit hotels for different reasons, the front desk team should be smart enough to identify and categorise different types of guest and their needs. This will allow them to provide an anticipatory service and exceed the guest's expectations.

## Medical travellers

Hotel staff should be sensitised to the medical traveller's unique needs and expectations. In a broad spectrum, medical guests require more hands-on care than normal guests. Hotel staff should make a habit of calling medical guests once or twice a day to make sure that they do not  need  any  help  and  have  everything  they  require. Hotel staff should be trained to anticipate these needs and any safety do's and don'ts (such as, do not need any help what to do and whom to call in an emergency) when serving or aiding medical travellers.

## Infants or toddlers

Luxury  hotels  sometimes  have  adjoining  rooms  for children  to  provide  the  guests  with  more  space  and privacy, but the guests have to pay for it. Such hotels specifically state that it caters to families and children and are expensive. Many hotels offer a range of facilities for babies and toddlers, such as children's tea-time, play areas, highchairs, and cots to make guests' holidays as enjoyable as possible. Some hotels also have a crèche or childcare facilities, so that the guests can take some time away from the baby but still be within the hotel.

## Basic Safeguards and Emergency Procedures for Senior Citizens in Case of Emergencies

The  Housekeeping  Attendant  will  be  expected  to  help the  guests  evacuate,  especially  children  and  elderly. They may ensure that all rooms are vacated before they themselves evacuate. Also, if time permits, they should carry with them their job sheet, room allotment list and other documents. These documents should be handed over to the Marshal or another authority after evacuation.

Both guests and the staff have to evacuate the hotel in case of an emergency. At such times, hotel officials and relief workers may not be able to reach everyone right  away.  Though  signages  are  displayed  at  several points in hotels which displays procedures to deal with emergencies,  guests  should  be  educated  in  advance at the time of check-in about the support network for senior citizens as a preventive measure for any hotel to handle an emergency.

Following are a few basic safeguard and emergency procedures that can be followed:

- · Family  contact  information  should  be  kept  in elderly people's wallet.

- · Educate  about  the  availability  and  accessibility of support items like wheelchairs and walkers so that they can be found quickly.
- · Advise the attendants of senior citizens to keep the medicines along with them.
- · Hotel staff at the Front Office must note alternative contact numbers of senior citizens' guardians so as to easily contact in case of emergency.

## Importance and need of medical facility at hotel

Being ill when far from home is highly stressful; thus many  hotels  have  basic  medical  facilities  to  provide prompt  dedicated  healthcare  support  to  their  guests. As more and more patients travel to different countries and States to access healthcare services, it is becoming increasingly important for hotels and other hospitality service providers to understand their role in the medical facilities  at  hotels.  What  can  hotels  do  to  ensure  an optimal  recovery  environment  for  guests?  Hotels  that wish to cater to medical guests need to be clear that their main mission is not to provide medical care, but instead, to provide first-aid to their guests. Hotels that cater  medical  facilities  should  consider  making  the following modifications to hotel spaces and a percentage of their guest rooms:

- · Hotel entryways should be wheelchair accessible
- · Corridors free of any steps or abrupt vertical level changes
- · Full size elevator that can comfortably accommodate  a  wheelchair  or  a  patient  with  a walker
- · All doors into and within select guest rooms should be  at  least  32'  to  accommodate  wheelchairs, crutches or walkers
- · Ample room space to manoeuvre a wheelchair
- · Wheelchair accessible peep holes
- · Portable shower benches
- · Faucet controls and shower diverter can be turned on and off easily and are operable and usable with one hand
- · Elevated or raised toilet seats with a grab bar

## Recreational facilities for children tourists

<!-- image -->

It has been projected that play or recreational activities are outlets of or expression of excess energy, channeling it into socially acceptable activities that fulfill individual as well as societal needs, without need for compulsion, and providing satisfaction and pleasure for the participant. Recreation is an activity of leisure, leisure being  discretionary  time.  Recreational  activities  are often done for enjoyment or pleasure and are considered to be 'fun loving activities'. At family hotels, you will find all  rooms that have been furnished with the needs of younger families in mind. Hotels also provide additional equipment  that  will  make  a  holiday  with  babies  and toddlers  as  easy  as  possible.  Interactive  indoor  and outdoor  recreational  activities  ensure  that  children have  an  enjoyable  stay  at  the  hotel.  All  recreational facilities for children are always under the supervision of attentive qualified staff.

Few recreational facilities for children tourists are:

## Indoor play areas

The  play  area  provides  facilities  to  children  of  board games, drawing and painting, face painting, photo frame making,  nature  craft,  hair  braiding,  shirt  painting, pool games, sand castles, puzzles, etc. With regards to children below the age group of four, parent supervision at the play area is essential wherein the child can play with soft toys and building blocks. In many hotels, a special section is dedicated to toddlers up to the age of 4 years. Equipped with adorable soft toys and other babyfriendly toys, this space offers mothers a serene haven to play and spend time with their babies.

## Outdoor play areas

Fun and action, fantastic  experiences  and  hour  after hour of entertainment all add up to endless pleasure. The play areas may include mini hockey pitch on grass, volleyball  court,  mini  golf  and  numerous  safe  open green  spaces  with  swings,  see-saw,  slides,  etc.  Also, there may be a tricycle trail with pedal go-karts where children can play freely without disturbing the adults.

## Special restaurants for kids

Hotels  have  facilities like restaurants  reserved  for children which have a pizzeria with wood-fired oven and grill and with the option of providing lunch and dinner with the entertainment staff (with extra charge at lunch for those young guests who have booked the half-board option). For children up to one year old, the presence of one parent is obligatory.

## Toddler's swimming pool

Hotels  have  a  separate  less  deep  indoor  or  outdoor swimming pools for children wherein the kids can enjoy under the supervision of attentive qualified staff.

## Equality of Women at Workplace

Companies  around  the  world  are currently going through a period of transforming and changing. Some are  expanding  their  business  globally  while  some  are wondering how the change will impact their organisation. As  we  know,  persons  of  all  genders  are  entering  the labour  force  in  equal  numbers  but  the  majority  of top  management  positions  still  belong  to  men.  Still discrimination at the workplace on the basis of gender remains a problem as social norms continue to restrict the occupational choices by women and men, thereby distorting labour markets, depressing wages, and hurting business innovation and productivity. Women are often unable to break the upper levels of corporate management  due  to  'glass  ceiling'.  The  term  'glass ceiling' refers to situations where the advancement of a qualified person within the hierarchy of an organisation is  stopped  at  a  lower  level  because  of  some  form  of discrimination, most commonly sexism or racism.

There are many reasons that cause this situation. One  of the reasons  is job segregation. It is the concentration  of  women  and  men  in  different  types and levels of activities and employment. Usually, men tend to be highly concentrated in the professions such as  managers,  supervisor,  production  supervisors  and executives. Women, on the other hand, tend to occupy lesser  paid  professions  such  as  teachers,  secretaries, receptionists and nurses.

Sadly, there are many barriers that prevent women from  reaching  one  of the higher positions in an organisation.  One  of  the  barriers  is  the  environment

at a workplace.  Organisational  culture,  employees' attitude and racial stereotypes commonly limit women from actively participating in the organisation. Working parents, especially mothers, usually have to deal with family  obligation.  They  often  have  to  choose  between their  job  and  family  for  which  they  require  flexible hours at work. The concept of spending equal time with the family by all genders is still not culturally popular in India.

Many organisations  are  trying  to  integrate  changes to  enable  more  women  to  become  a  part  of  the  top management  positions  and  fulfil  their  dreams.  Some examples are work from home, flexible timing and so on.

Following  measures  can  be  adopted  to  provide equality for women at work across both horizontal and vertical segregation:

## Assign roles or jobs based on ability, not gender

The hiring and allocation of work must be conducted on the basis of an individual's abilities and character, regardless of whether they are male or female.

Following three steps will help in attaining gender equality at workplace:

- · Select candidates for interviews based on their  education,  experience  and  other  required qualifications.
- · Pay  salaries  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing rates rather than on the basis of the candidate's previous salary drawn.
- · Change company culture to reward the outcomes achieved, not as per the number of working hours.

## Encourage women to make the leap

So  many  women  miss  out  on  great  opportunities because they think themselves to be underqualified. Meanwhile, men often go after promotions and projects they are not qualified for.

This is where employers can offer equal opportunity for  women  as  well  as  men  by  actively  encouraging women to take more chances and go for the

opportunities they desire. External support is great for confidence building.

## Build new roles for women so that the business can evolve

With time, greater number of women are entering into the world of work, including the hospitality business. Women  bring  a  different  and  unique  perspective  to business  and  we  need  to  celebrate  and  integrate  it. Instead  of  trying  to  shove  women  into  the  roles  that men have been doing for decades, we should be more interested in hiring savvy women to develop new roles and benchmarks for how success is created.

## Stop pay inequality and gender gap

In order to promote female equality at the workplace, it must first begin with equal pay. Pay disparity and gender gap are two of the biggest recurring issues amongst the workforce,  and  certainly  a  catalyst  to  ongoing  class action  lawsuits.  Paying  employees  fairly  and  equally based on experience level, not on gender, is truly the first step needed to promote gender equality.

## Start at the top

For ensuring equality, this requires a shift in organisational culture, which  typically starts from the  top  chain  of  command  of  the  company.  Create  a cross-functional team to find out and study what other companies, competitors and non-competitors alike are doing to promote female equality and its positive effects on  culture,  retention  and  business  of  that  company. This team should report its observations to the management  of  the  organisation  so  that  better  work practices can be followed.

## Have more options for women

The  pay  disparity  generally  becomes  more  marked when a woman gets into family planning. During the time of child bearing, women are generally constrained to  avoid  taking  up    more  demanding  jobs    and  work responsibilities  due  to  family  obligations.  Companies need  to  create  more  flexible  options  for  such  women

including  telecommuting,  job  sharing  and  consulting assignments to motivate women and keep their financial and professional continuity intact.

## Motivating Women at the Workplace

Women are often dynamic leaders of change. Yet women are  still  far  from  equal  representation  in  positions  of power  and  leadership,  both  in  corporate  boardrooms and  presidential  cabinets.  Discriminatory  laws  and practices hold women back, as do limits on education, income and compelling family and social responsibilities.

Following are a few effective ways to motivate women at workplace:

## Make mentoring a must

Provide opportunities to women to align themselves with a  corporate  leader  who  can  coach  them,  guide  them, and help them professionally. This demonstrates your seriousness when it comes to the growth of your female workforce.

## Encourage personal sponsorship

Some  women  advance  faster  and  stronger  through  a sponsorship, especially when they are stagnated despite being  qualified  and  eligible  for  a  promotion  or  rise in salary. Sponsors can go to bat for them and advocate for their advancement within the company.

## Put some creativity into rewards

When a female employee truly goes above and beyond, a cash bonus may not always be the best way to recognise the achievement. Keep in mind the value of a day off with pay to allow them time to catch up on personal enjoyments,  attend  a  family  event  or  deal  with  home responsibilities.

## Give choice in leading a project

In male-dominated departments, it is easy to draw on the same ten people or the typical 'go to' person for leading a  project  or  completing  an  important  task.  Consider bringing in a woman-employee for this initiative to give

them  an  opportunity  to  showcase  their  abilities  and grow. Show trust in women employees also.

## Lifelong learning is an investment

Most companies have educational reimbursement plans for  formal,  long-term  programmes.  But  many  women are single-parents or caretakers for elderly parents and that type of commitment is too cumbersome. Consider offering one or two day skill development programmes and allow your female employees the chance to hone those everyday skills needed to grow on the job.

## Check how they want to be listened

When a woman shares a problem, check in to see if they just want to vent out or whether they want your involvement. Men like to fix shared problems but sometimes women just want to verbalise things to feel better.

## Show consistent respect and courtesy

Make sure your managers and supervisors understand the value of day-to-day recognition and are appropriately trained in expressing genuine respect for work and effort all year long.

## Reward equally and fairly

If there is one thing that irritates anyone, male or female, is  seeing someone else receive a pay raise, an award, or  some  form  of  recognition  when  they  themselves felt deserving  too.  It  is  recommended  that  all  the organisations take time to establish clear quantitative criteria and  parameters  that  are  used  to  evaluate performance and distribution of rewards.

## Express appreciation

All  employees should be thanked and appreciated for every achievement or good work done, in order to keep them motivated.

## Behavioural Etiquettes

It is often said that one's behaviour is the mirror to one's character. Indeed, your behaviour speaks a lot about

the  kind  of  person  you  are.  Our  educational  degrees hold  less  importance  if  we  are  not  a  well  mannered person. Even at your home in front of your relatives, it is your good behaviour which counts the most. But behavioural  etiquette  is  something  which  cannot  be forced on anyone, it has to be cultivated and nurtured within  oneself.  However,  remembering  a  few  basic principles  and  applying  them  wherever  required  can undoubtedly be helpful.

## Behavioural etiquettes when dealing with female colleagues

## Think before you speak

Though, your close friends may understand your dry sense of humor and blasé attitude, but you should keep personality quirks in check when dealing with female co-workers.

## Be courteous

Always be courteous while dealing with female guests and colleagues.

## Be a team player

Many companies have less staff strength, which means many employees have to shoulder a bigger workload. Make  a  point  not  to  overburden  your  co-workers  by shirking your responsibilities.

## Respect a closed door

If a colleague has shut her office door, stay out, even if she does not look occupied.

## Refrain from cracking jokes

One should avoid cracking a joke or doing prank with any co-worker.

## Write an email

The  easiest  way  to  confront  a  co-worker  is  often  via email- you get to express yourself without interacting face-to-face.

## Notes

<!-- image -->

## Notes

## Keep your personal matters and opinions at home

It is okay to have strong views, but it is not okay to push those views on your co-workers or pick fights with them when they do something you do not approve of.

## Watch your language even when you are away from your desk

Anything you do during the day even though you are on break, is a reflection of your professional self.

## If problems arise, handle them privately

In  case  of  any  problem  with  a  colleague  or  employer, resolve it between yourself and the counter party instead of making it public.

## Behavioural etiquettes when dealing with female guests

- · Always smile while welcoming the guests in your outlet.
- · Always give the guest full attention and do not say, 'Yes' until you completely understand what she is asking for.
- · Never say 'I don't know'. Tell the guest you will find out for her and ensure that she is provided with accurate information.
- · Never argue with the guest. Try to speak softly and clearly, without made-up accent.
- · Never talk negatively about the hotel or other staff with the guest.
- · Try  to  maintain  regular  eye  contact  with  your guest.  But  that  does  not  mean  to  continuously gaze at your guest, making them uncomfortable.

## Health and Hygiene at Workplace

Work  environment  and  health  are  two  inter-related aspects of occupational health. The purpose of occupational health is to maintain the physical, mental and social well-being of its workers and prevent ill-health caused due to their working conditions. It is the responsibility of employers to protect its workers as well as customers from any health risk and to maintain their optimum health. Employers have to ensure that no health hazards arise as a result of or during work activities.

The only way to reduce the spread of illness and risk to health is through maintaining best hygiene practices. Since  cleaning  process  removes  infections,  microbes as well as dirt and soil, it is generally the best way to maintain hygiene and therefore health.

Cleaning  is  important  not  only  from  the  point  of hygiene but also from the point of safety, security and maintaining health. Hygiene is an important issue for all kinds of accommodation seekers irrespective of what kind  of  accommodation  they  seek.  Cleanliness  of  the guest rooms or the public areas of the hotel makes the first impression on the guest.

Health is the physical, mental and social well-being. A  common  proverb  says  'Health  is  Wealth'.  A  daily routine consisting of balanced diet, physical exercise, leisure and sound sleep without drugs goes a long way

in maintaining good health. A healthy person has more energy and therefore can work better, earn more and live comfortably.

In this unit, you  will  learn  about  keeping  the workplace  clean  and  the  ways  to  maintain  personal health and hygiene.

## SeSSion  1:  importance  of  cleaning  at  Workplace and Workplace inSpection

## Cleaning around Workplace

Hygiene is termed as a set of good habits or practices that are executed in order to maintain good health. Hygiene can be categorised as personal hygiene, medical hygiene, hand hygiene, home hygiene and commercial hygiene.

Cleanliness is a state of being free of dirt and germs. Although it is  impossible  for  anyone  to  get  rid  of  the germs  entirely  regardless  of  all  the  techniques,  as millions  of  germs  are  present  in  the  air.  The  aim  of cleanliness  is  to  have  a  healthy  environment  and safe workplace.

A clean workplace is a place where there is an all round protection from germs to body and health. Any place or surface which looks clean to human eye might not actually be germ-free.

The  workplace  environment  influences  employees' productivity, performance and well-being. In every industry, maintaining a clean workplace may help keep staff  members  safe,  healthy  and  efficient.  However, busy  production  schedules  and  increasing  workload may lower down the standards.

While it may be easy to put off dusting or other types of cleaning around the office or workplace, doing so may put employees at the risk of suffering an injury or illness and may even impact the performance levels.

## Importance of a Safe Workplace

Following are the reasons showing importance of a safe workplace:

- 1. To  maintain  clean,  dry  floors  to  prevent  slips and falls

- 2. Using disinfectants prevent the spread of germs and illness, including the flu
- 3. Standardised air filtration lowers employee exposure to hazardous substances
- 4. To clean light fixtures improve lighting efficiency
- 5. For  specified  disposal  of  waste  and  recyclable materials, keep work areas clutter-free
- 6. To clean the environment
- 7. For maintaining regular cleaning

## Waste Segregation

Waste segregation refers to the practice of separating waste material and placing it into an appropriate waste container immediately after the waste is generated so that it can be disposed easily.

## Reasons of segregation of waste material

- 1. It is the only way to increase the recycling rate of waste material.
- 2. It  makes  re-cycling  or  disposal  of  waste  more efficient and productive.
- 3. Pure  biodegradable  waste  can  produce  enough energy which can be used for other purposes.
- 4. It is the only way to increase the recycling rate.
- 5. Many  parts  of  waste  can  be  reused  for  other purposes.
- 6. It decreases  the  cost  at  several  steps  of  the disposal system.
- 7. Hazardous waste can cause serious health problems at present or in near future.
- 8. Proper segregation is the basic requirement for waste incineration.

## Types of waste

Waste can be classified into following types:

- 1. Wet waste
- 2. Dry waste
- 3. Sanitary waste
- 4. Garden waste or Green waste
- 5. Hazardous household waste

## Guidelines for Segregation of Waste

To  assist  with  segregation  of  waste,  the  following guidelines may be useful:

## Colour code for different types of waste

| Green                            | Blue                  | Brown                                             | Black                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Example:     Paper     cardboard | Example:     Plastics | Example:     Food waste            for composting | Example:     General  mixed waste |

## Note

- · Collect in clear plastic bags to ensure that the waste is segregated correctly.
- · Use photographs as well as text to help draw the attention of employees who have difficulty in reading English.

## Handling of Waste Material

'Waste Material' is a term which refers to those items which are useless, unusable, unwanted or discarded. The waste material produced by the human activities results in negative effect on the environment. The nature of the waste may be of solid, liquid, radioactive or gas type. Organic waste can be reused for generating power or electricity.

<!-- image -->

Personal Protective Equipment required for handling waste or trash are as follows:

- 1. Gloves as protective equipment
- 2. Face mask
- 3. Garbage bag
- 4. Garbage bin or Dustbin

## Chemicals required for use

Multipurpose cleaning agent, e.g., R2

## Activities to be performed before handling waste

- 1. Wearing gloves
- 2. Wearing PPE
- 3. Washing hands before and after handling waste
- 4. Never overfill waste bags

## Standard operating procedure for handling dustbin (removal of waste)

- 1. Pick up ashtrays and empty the contents in the garbage bin.
- 2. Pick up all the trash from the counter area and place it in the garbage bin.
- 3. Move all the trash collected in the garbage bin into garbage collecting bag or soiled bag of the attendant trolley.
- 4. Wipe out the trash containers with a damp cloth and put to dry.
- 5. Place a liner in each trash container.
- 6. Place bath trash container on the left hand side of the sink without liner.
- 7. Place  bedroom  trash  container  underneath  the desk next to the dresser.
- 8. Check  the  condition  of  matchboxes  and  place with logo sitting up, next to the ashtrays.

## Following are the points to be considered for planning handling or removal of waste material

- 1. Budget should be prepared for the collection and disposal of waste.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 2. Identify the areas where over production of waste may be occurring.
- 3. Check the areas where reducing waste is possible.
- 4. All staff of the organisation should be trained in proper waste handling.
- 5. Safety  requirement  for  staff,  such  as  Personal Protective Equipment must be fulfilled.
- 6. Decide the collection areas-always ensure that the waste collection areas are kept clean and bins are  clearly  marked  and  segregated.  Use  safety signs  in  these  areas  and  also  ensure  that  the staff  knows  the  standard  operating  procedure of  handling  all  types  of  bins.  The  staff  should know about a particular bin being placed for a particular purpose. The observation by the senior staff members is also necessary to keep the place in order.

## Pest Control Activities at Workplace

## Pest control

Guests will  be  upset  if  they  find  the  pests  or  insects anywhere in the premises. Pests can cause discomfort or  uneasiness  and  also  spread  diseases.  Workplace should have procedures for dealing with the pests. Look out  for  pests  and  tell  your  supervisor  if  you  see  any signs of their presence.

Insects or pests enter buildings seeking food, shelter or  surroundings  having  the  right  temperature  and humidity to grow and breed. The key to successful pest control is eliminating one or more of these conducive factors which lead to the growth of insects and pests. Sanitation is an important part of control. Successful pest control should begin with good cleaning practices.

It is important to know about the habits of the pests in  order  to  take  proper  preventative  measures and to select  and  apply  appropriate  pest  control  products correctly. Keep in mind that different pests may be found in  different  parts  of  the  building,  in  different  seasons or in different years. A few common pests found in the hotels and methods of their control are described here.

## noteS

<!-- image -->

## Pests include

- · Insects  e.g.,  flies,  cockroaches,  silverfish,  fleas, ants and bed bugs. (Fig. 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5)
- · Vermin (mice, rats and possums)

Signs of pests may include droppings, spots on walls and surfaces, eggs and cocoons. If you see any of these signs,  tell  your  superior  or  Housekeeping  supervisor immediately.

If you are cleaning counter desk, you may be able to spray flies, ants or silverfish with an environmentally friendly insect spray. But use a small amount only and wear gloves and a mask.

## Maintenance of Work and its Importance

Reporting of maintenance problems should always be done  as  the  customers  expect  that  everything  in  the working  area  will  be  in  good  condition  or  in  working order. Reported faults will be needed to be dealt with quickly  and  efficiently  to  prevent  accidents  and  to prevent the loss of revenue and customer discomfort.

Items, which may require repair in the counter area:

- · Broken chair
- · Broken tables
- · Light bulbs

- · Dripping taps
- · Air conditioning

When a maintenance problem is found, the Housekeeping Attendant must complete a maintenance request  form  in  writing  and  follow  the  policy  and procedure of the organisation. It is important to fill the form correctly, to ensure that the relevant information is  communicated  to  the  maintenance  department,  in order to avoid misunderstanding and confusion.

This maintenance request form is usually prepared in triplicate, one each for:

- 1. Tradesman (i.e. plumber or electrician)
- 2. Chief maintenance engineer
- 3. Housekeeping Attendant (as a record and follow up)

As per the standard procedure, these forms are to be given to the supervisor for submission to the appropriate department, at the end of a shift or earlier.

## Example of a Maintenance Request or Report

These forms would be filled up and can be placed in the information folder.

## Work Order System

<!-- image -->

The  work  order  system  is  essentially  required  for day-to-day repairs in hotels. Everywhere in the organisation, in each department, repairs of furniture, fixtures and equipment are required. To promptly rectify these  defects,  most  organisations  would  use  a  'work order' system and a separate maintenance department to deal with and prepare a 'maintenance request'.

Whatever the defect, the problem needs to be resolved promptly  and  the  work  order  system  is  a  process  of documentation and communication to get the defective item  repaired  quickly  to  ensure  smooth  operation  of the task.

<!-- image -->

## Advantages of a work order system

This work order form is prepared in 'triplicate' so that the department reporting the problem keeps one copy of the request and the other two copies go to the Maintenance Department.

Many  hotels  now  use  a  computerised  work  order system to report faults. Employees simply enter the  fault  details  into  the  computer  and  it  links  with the Maintenance and Reception departments. It allows  the  departments  to  check  the  progress  of  any reported defects.

## Proper Ventilation of the Area

## Ventilation

It  means a free passage of clean and fresh air by the supply of outside air into the room or the removal of inside  air  from  an  enclosed  space.  It  is  a  process  of supplying  and  removing  air  from  a  building,  which could be achieved by natural and mechanical means. Ventilation provides fresh air in place of the air containing unwanted fumes, smoke, steam or vapour. Ventilation includes an exhaust system to remove stale air and another system that provides fresh air.

Good  ventilation  protects  us,  our  family,  and  our guests  from  unpleasant  odour,  irritating  pollutants,

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## noteS

<!-- image -->

and  potentially  dangerous  gases  like  carbon  dioxide and  carbon  monoxide.  A  well-designed  and  properlyoperated  ventilation  system  also  prevents  the  growth of  mould  and  mildew,  which  can  cause  or  aggravate allergic reactions and lung problems such as asthma. Because people generally spend about 90 per cent of their time inside, indoor air pollution can actually be a bigger health risk than outdoor air pollution.

## Purpose of ventilation

- · To  provide  fresh  and  clean  air  to  maintain  a thermally comfortable work environment, and to remove or dilute the airborne contaminants.
- · To maintain the temperature and humidity within acceptable range.
- · To  avoid  accumulation  of  excessive  quantity  of carbon dioxide in the air,  resulting  in  difficulty in breathing. It is also required to suppress the body odour, smoke and concentration of bacteria and  other  microorganisms.  It  is  required  to remove body heat generated by the occupants. It is required to prevent suffocation.

Ventilation system is needed so as to provide a proper flow of oxygen and remove stale and impure gases, heat, dust, etc. It is also needed to remove contaminants such as smoke, lint particles, CO , etc. 2

## Types of ventilation

Ventilation at a workplace is basically of two types:

- 1. General ventilation: Removal of stale and old air from the general area by passing fresh air.
- 2. Diluted  ventilation:  Supply  of  outside  air  to reduce the airborne contamination in the space.

## Systems of ventilation

These are:

- (i) Natural ventilation
- (ii) Mechanical  or  Artificial  Ventilation  Extraction system supply pressure system:
- (a) Inlet
- (b) Extract

- (c) Combined supply inlet and Extraction system
- (d) Plenum process
- (iii) Localised exhaust ventilation

## General ventilation design

- · Good air flow is very necessary.
- · Proper ventilation can maintain the freshness of air, prevent the accumulation of heat and control the level of airborne contaminants.
- · Carbon dioxide level higher than 1,000 ppm may indicate the insufficiency of indoor ventilation.
- · The  location  of  fresh  air  intake  points  should be  carefully  designed  to  prevent  the  intake  of contaminated air.
- · Optimum temperature of 20°C-26°C.
- · Optimum humidity of 40-70 per cent.
- · Minimise the blockage of air flow from the supply registers.
- · Too much air movement causes draught whereas too little air movement may cause stuffiness.
- · Adjust diffusers and  air grilles properly.
- · Regular  maintenance  to  keep  the  ventilation system clean and ensure efficient functioning.

## Infection control measures and ventilation issues

- · Microorganisms are present everywhere whether it is indoors or outdoors.
- · Avoid growth of fungus or mould on any material whether it is food or clothes or any other surface.
- · High  humidity,  pressure  of  air,  stagnant  water and any place or equipment   having dust provides favourable conditions for the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms.
- · Always use an updated and up to the mark airfilter  to  prevent  bacterial  growth  and  airborne diseases.
- · Always empty the water reservoir and stringent water sources which may encourage the growth of fungus, bacteria or any other microorganisms.

plenum  process: is  a type of air-conditioning system in which air is passed into a room at a pressure  greater  than atmospheric pressure.

## Maintenance of mechanical ventilation systems

<!-- image -->

Maintenance of mechanical ventilation systems is done by following the given steps:

- · Regular inspection, cleaning, testing and maintenance schedules should be drawn up and followed.
- · Replace the air filters periodically.
- · Inspect all the components of ventilation system for  cleanliness  and  microbial  growth  regularly, and clean them as and when required.
- · Every  time  test  the  performance  of  the  system against the design specification and make necessary adjustment or repair.
- · If water cooling towers are used, they should be so maintained, as appropriate to prevent the growth of microorganisms, e.g., use of biocides.
- · Ventilation system should function properly and be regularly maintained.
- · Air-conditioning systems should be cleaned regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- · Filters should be changed or cleaned periodically according  to  the  manufacturer's  instructions. Staff  should  put  on  appropriate  PPE  (such  as goggles and gloves, etc.) when changing the filter.
- · Grilles and air ducts should be cleaned regularly.

## Air conditioning system

Air  conditioner  at  right  temperature  cleans  air  and humidity. The air conditioning system should be regularly checked and maintained for smooth functioning.  The building should be constructed in such a way that fresh and clean air is adequately available.

## Advantages of air conditioning

- (a) Improved quality and productivity of work
- (b) Controlled and maintained humidity
- (c) Improved psychological atmosphere
- (d) More comfort and less stress
- (e) More active and efficient

## Maintaining central air conditioning system

- · Always  check  for  the  possibility  of  leaking  of refrigerant or air conditioning system.
- · Look for loose or worn out drive belts.
- · Check internal operating pressure in the system.
- · For regular maintenance,  a  filter should  be checked once a month to see if it needs cleaning or replacing. Change the filter and hold to a bright light, then try to look through it if you can see the light easily.
- · Outer  condensing  unit  should  be  cleaned  of accumulated dust and dirt, especially near inlet and  outlet  of  discharge  grills.  A  brush  or  hose should be used to clean all the dirt and dust.
- · Use vacuum cleaning once a month to clean off the louvres and once a year remove them entirely so that you can clean the back of the louvres as well as the inside of the ducts as far as you can reach easily.

## Maintenance of air conditioner

Air conditioning, often the split ductless air conditioner plays an  important  role  in maintaining  the  hotel temperature. Following points have to be kept in mind for regular maintenance of air conditioner:

- · Buy an aircon wash bag.
- · Buy a good coil cleaner.
- · Install the aircon wash bag around the split AC unit (called an FCU- Fan Coil Unit) on the wall.
- · Start  spraying  the  chemical  solution  over  the coils.
- · Spray the rotary blades hidden in the outlet of the airflow.
- · Wait for 10 to 20 minutes for the cleaning solution to work.
- · Wipe down the fan coil unit.
- · Regular maintenance and clean up of air filters
- · Cleaning of evaporator coils
- · Maintenance of the condenser coil

louvre: each  of  a  set of  angled  slots  fixed  or hung at regular intervals in a door, shutter or screen  to  allow  air  or light to pass  through. In  this  context,  louvres refer to the vents of A.C. (Source: Oxford Dictionary of English, Third Edition)

## noteS

- · Cleaning coil fins
- · Unclog the rear drain
- · Cover up the compressor unit during winters
- · Do not miss an AC service

## When AC is not working at all

- 1. Be  sure  it  is  receiving  power  at  the  electrical panel.
- 2. Reset the equipment's switches and/or overloads.
- 3. Check the thermostat settings.
- 4. Check the condensate overflow switch.

## If AC is not cooling when switched on

- 1. Turn off the power.
- 2. Clean or change the filter.
- 3. Look to see if ice has formed on the coils and, if it has, turn on the power and the fan to melt it.
- 4. Clean the condensate drain.
- 5. Finally, check and clean the outdoor compressor.

## Mechanical systems

The mechanical systems of ventilation within an organisation are  often  one  of  the  most  expensive  parts  of  a building. They include all  the  HVAC  systems,  commercial space and guest laundry, elevators, kitchen equipment and  pool  water  systems.  Engineered  and  specified properly, these systems are built to operate for a long period of time to provide clean and safe environment. To realise their full operating potential requires a proactive and dedicated system of maintenance and evaluation.

The  maintenance  is  a  simple  process.  It  includes changing the filters regularly and getting the internal elements  cleaned  and  checked  annually.  It  is  also worthwhile to take the time to understand how much energy  the  systems  should  typically  be  burning.  By knowing how much electricity a specific hotel generally uses, we are able to notice the fluctuations in usage, which  could  indicate  that  one  of  its  systems  is  not functioning properly.

## Importance of lighting in an area

Sufficient  lighting  must  be  provided  in  a  commercial sales  organisation,  whether  it  is  from  a  natural  or artificial  source,  to  allow  safe  movement  around  the workplace and to allow the workers to perform their job without having to adopt awkward postures of body or strain their eyes to see.

The following factors should be taken into account:

- 1. The type of work activity
- 2. The nature of hazards and risks at the workplace
- 3. The work environment and culture
- 4. Illumination  levels,  including  both  natural  and artificial light
- 5. The transition of natural light over the day
- 6. Contrast reflections

Additional lighting may be needed at places of high risk  (such  as,  stairwells,  store  rooms,  laundry  room, corridors, etc.). Different lighting levels may be needed for  different  times  of  the  day.  Too  much  lighting  can result in glare.

## Measures to prevent in case of low level of lighting, glare or reflection

- 1. Providing  more  lighting,  such  as  a  lamp  on  a flexible or movable arm
- 2. Changing the position of the existing fittings
- 3. Changing the location of the workstation
- 4. Increasing the number of lights
- 5. Changing  the  type  of  lighting  used,  e.g.  from white light to blue light
- 6. Changing  the  diffusers or reflectors on  the existing lights to improve illumination
- 7. Using screens, visors, shields, hoods, curtains, blinds or external louvres to reduce reflections, shadows and glare for more illumination.
- 8. Emergency lighting must be provided for safe  evacuation  of  people  in  the  event  of  an emergency.

## Cleaning and Maintenance of Food Storage Area

Following points should be followed while cleaning and maintaining a storage area:

- 1. Always keep all the storage areas clean and dry.
- 2. Check  floors,  walls  and  shelving  in  coolers, freezers, and dry storage areas on a regular basis.
- 3. Clean up spills and leaks right away to stop the contamination of other foods.
- 4. Clean dollies, carts, transporters and trays often.
- 5. Avoid  shelving  too  many  items  close  together. Make sure shelves are open so that air can flow between shelved food items.
- 6. All items should be kept 6' away from the walls and floors.
- 7. All items should be kept 12' away from the ceiling.
- 8. Make sure each food item has a specific place for storing and is labeled.
- 9. Repair  cracks  and  crevices  of  wall  in  storage areas to avoid the breeding of pests.
- 10. Repair the doors and windows that don't close tightly.

Fig. 6.6: Dry food storage area

## Tips for Dry Food Storage

- 1. Dry  storage  of  food  should  stay  cool and dry.
- 2. Temperature of the dry storage area of food should be between 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit.
- 3. There should be sufficient ventilation to keep the temperature and humidity consistent.

All steps  involved  in  the  delivery  are important  and  crucial  for  food  safety.  It  is

important to inspect foods when they are delivered and it should be checked by the receiver of the food material, store them in the correct location and temperature and ensure that the food storage areas are well maintained.

Accepting only the best quality products for your facility is important.

## Shelf stable food storage

- 1. Steel racks, cabinets and pantries are storage areas for foods having long  shelf  life  such  as,  canned foods, cereals, rice, pasta, baking mixes  and  spices.  These  areas should be cool and well ventilated, clean and dry. Poor storage areas are  by  the  cook  tops,  under  the sink  and  drainage,  or  any  place that  is  damp  with  high  and  low temperature  extremes,  such  as garages or basements.

Fig. 6.7: Shelf stable food storage

<!-- image -->

- 2. Dry  storage  areas  should  be  well  maintained with proper air flow. Spilled dry cereals, crumbs and  sugars  attract  insects  and  pests;  prompt clean-up prevents pests. Clean the shelf surfaces with  water  and  dishwashing  liquid  soap,  rinse and air dry.
- 3. Canned  goods  that  are  having  bad  shape  like dented, rusted or bulging, should be discarded. The canned and dry goods stored on the shelves should be used on rotation basis i.e., using the oldest products first. In order to know a product's age, look on the package for 'use by dates'.

## Cleaning and preparing tables

- 1. You may be required to clean and prepare the tables before opening hours or commercial hours.
- 2. Every time an initial  check  should  be  made  to ensure that the tables are safe and secure. The tables should be solid and not wobble, a check should also be made of chairs, furniture and other aspects (electrical cords, frayed carpet) for safety.
- 3. Tables should be cleaned and, where necessary, a cloth may be laid.
- 4. If you are bussing tables in a food court or at a large food service area, the table should be clear

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## noteS

<!-- image -->

of  any  place  mats,  cutlery  and  plates.  All  the table tops should be clean and streak free.

## Clean food preparation surfaces

Microorganisms  and  bacteria  can  be  easily  spread through  the  surfaces  with  which  food  comes  into contact in the kitchen or food preparation space such as, kitchen slab, sink, chopping boards, sieves, plates, utensils, etc. One way to limit the spread of food-borne bacteria is to thoroughly clean the food preparation and mealtime surfaces before and after cooking.

## To clean surfaces

- 1. Always wipe out the spills  on  kitchen  surfaces immediately using a paper towel or clean cloth.
- 2. Every time wash the counter tops with hot soapy water after preparing each food item and before moving onto the next.
- 3. Always wash the table tops with hot soapy water before and after each mealtime.
- 4. Sanitise  the  counter  tops  and  tabletops  with a bleach-water solution, mix 15 milliliters (approximately 1 tablespoon) of chlorine bleach to 4 litres (approximately 1 gallon) of water.
- 5. Allow the surface to air-dry without touching it.

## Note

- · All kitchen cloths, towels and cleaning supplies should be kept clean and changed daily. Always use separate cloths and towels for cleaning and cooking to avoid contamination and cross contamination.
- · Another way to limit the spread of food-borne bacteria or disease is to prevent cross-contamination from uncooked meat, poultry, seafood and eggs to other foods.

## Cleaning flatware and cutlery

The  given  points  should  be  followed  while  cleaning flatware and cutlery:

- · Every  time  wash  the  gold  plated  flatware  by hand and buff to bring up the shine and prevent water spots.

- · Silver  plated  flatware  may  be  washed  in  the dishwashing machine, but will need to be polished less often if it is washed by hand properly.
- · Rinse  with  salt  and  acidic  food  (like,  lemon, vinegar or tamarind) to clean flatware as soon as possible to avoid stains.
- · Clean  streaks  on  your  everyday  flatware  by rubbing with a soft cloth sprinkled with a little olive oil. Use a second cloth to buff.
- · Make a paste of cornstarch and water and apply it to the tarnished or spotted silverware. Let dry, wipe clean with a dry cloth.
- · Mix  a  solution  of  5  ounces  of  dry  baby  milk powder, 12 ounces water, and 1 tablespoon white vinegar. Pour it into a 9 × 13 inch cake pan. Drop in  tarnished silverware, and let it sit overnight. Rinse and dry all the pieces thoroughly.
- · Store the silverware in rolls, bags or cases made with special tarnish-resistant cloth.
- · Place  one  or  two  pieces  of  white  chalk  in  your silverware chest to prevent tarnishing.
- · Do  not  allow  stainless-steel  flatware  to  touch anything made of silver in the dishwasher. It will set up an electrolytic action that pits the stainless steel and leaves black spots on the silver.

## Silverware polishing

- · To  polish,  pick  up  the  washed  silver  from  the dishwashing area and deliver it to the polishing area.
- · Prepare hot water in a stainless steel pot put the silverware into the hot water before polishing.
- · Polish by using an adequate silverware cleaning cloth.
- · Check the silverware for any damage.
- · Make sure all the silverware is stocked properly and in good order.

## Glassware polishing

## Dental care

Taking good care of your teeth gives you a nice smile, but it also can keep you in good health. Poor oral hygiene is  linked  to  heart  disease,  diabetes  and  pregnancy complications. And tooth loss can make it hard to eat a healthy diet, leading to even more health troubles from poor oral hygiene.

## Oral hygiene steps

- 1. Brush: Always  brush  your  teeth  twice  a  day with  the  help  of  soft  bristled  toothbrush.  Use toothpaste  that  contains  fluoride.  After  waiting for 30-45 minutes, eating or drinking are allowed.
- 2. Floss: Use dental floss once a day to clean the tight spaces between your teeth.
- 3. Rinse: Rinse your mouth for 30 minutes.

## Cross contamination

Food contamination occurs when  physical object, chemicals  or  bacteria  is  transferred  to  food  either through  poor  food  handling  practices,  poor  cleaning practices or from another food source. This is known as cross contamination.

Cross contamination takes place when bacteria and viruses are transferred from a contaminated surface to non-contaminated  surface.  The  bacteria  and  viruses can come from people, work surfaces or equipment, and other foods.

For example, cross contamination can happen when bacteria from the surface of raw meat, poultry and raw vegetables are transferred onto ready-to-eat food, such as green salads, rice or pasta salads, cooked meats or poultry or even fruit.

The bacteria on the raw food are killed when the food is cooked, but the ready-to-eat food gets eaten without further cooking.

Bacteria are transferred by hands from raw to readyto-eat  food,  but  direct  contact  with  raw  foods,  dirty chopping boards, knives and other cooking implements can also spread the contamination.

Chopping boards, plates and knives that have been in contact with raw food must be washed and sanitised, then rinsed and thoroughly dried before being used for ready-to-eat foods.

Cross-contamination can take place during several stages of food handling which can be avoided by strictly following the SOPs.

Cross contamination can be reduced by using good hygiene practices, including:

- · Washing and sanitising all equipment including utensils, knives, chopping  boards and  work surfaces  before  and  after  use  when  preparing different foods.
- · Washing hands in between preparation tasks.
- · Changing single-use gloves after handling raw foods.
- · Using a clean utensil each time food is tasted.
- · Minimising contact with food wherever possible by using utensils or single-use gloves.
- · Not storing raw foods above cooked foods.

## Routes for cross contamination

There are three ways in which cross contamination can occur.

- (i) Food to food
- (ii) People to food
- (iii) Equipment to food

pe

## (i) Food to food

Bacteria  transferred  from  other  food  results  in  cross contamination.  Problem  arises  when  raw  food  comes into contact with the cooked foods. Some examples of food to food contamination are as follows:

- · Placement of meat in the top shelf and of vegetable in the lower shelf is a bad practice as drippings falls from raw meat onto vegetables, causing food to food contamination.

## (ii) People to food

Physical touch of humans can also be a source of cross contamination to foods.

HEALTH AND HYGIENE AT WORKPLACE

## noteS

## noteS

<!-- image -->

- · Example: Handling vegetarian and non vegetarian food items after using toilet.

## (iii) Equipment to food

Cross  contamination  can  also  take  place  with  the contact  of  kitchen  equipment  and  utensils  with  food. This  is  specially  the  case  when  equipment  are  not properly cleaned.

Example: Storage of sauce in a non-cleaned container used for other non vegetarian food preparation.

## Prevention of cross contamination

Following should be kept in mind for preventing cross contamination:

## (i) When refrigerating food

- · Food material containing juices should be placed in a container or in a sealed plastic bag to prevent leakage of juices from dripping onto other foods. Raw  juices  might  sometimes  contain  harmful bacteria.
- · Store eggs in their original carton and refrigerate them as soon as possible.

## (ii) When preparing food, keep it clean

- · Wash hands and table top surfaces regularly after starting or finishing the work.
- · Wash hands with soap and water before and after handling food.
- · Wash hands with soap and hot water before and after handling food, and after using the bathroom, changing diapers; or handling pets.
- · Wash the chopping board regularly.

## (iii) Cutting boards

- · Use a clean chopping board.
- · Use  separate  chopping  boards  for  vegetarian (green leafy vegetables, etc.) and non vegetarian foods (raw meat, poultry and seafood).
- · Replace chopping boards if the surface develops cracks, is worn out or develops scratches through knives.

## (iv) Marinating food

- · Allow the food to marinate in refrigerator.
- · Never use the sauce used for marinating for other food preparations.

## (v) Fruits and vegetables

- · Always rinse fresh fruits and vegetables in running tap water to remove visible dirt and grime.
- · Always remove the outermost leaves of a lettuce or cabbage.
- · Pay attention while cutting vegetables as bacteria grows on the cut surface of fruit or vegetables.

## (vi) When serving food

- · Always prefer to serve food on a clean plate.
- · Never use the plate previously used for holding raw food for serving cooked food.

## Cleaning areas to prevent cross contamination

Cleaning of the following areas is required to prevent cross contamination at place:

- 1. Floors: need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly with appropriate chemicals.
- 2. Walls: Walls  should  be  made  of  impervious, non-absorbent  and  non-toxic  material  for  easy cleaning.
- 3. Ceilings: these  need  to  be  constructed  or  decorated in a way that it prevents dust and dirt to gather in the crevices and reduces condensation.
- 4. Windows: Windows and other openings must be designed keeping in mind the minimum collection of dust and grime build up.
- 5. Doors: Doors must be easy to clean and, where necessary, must be disinfected.

## Safety at Workplace

Safety at workplace refers to the working environment at  an  organisation  or  company  and  encompasses  all the factors that may impact the safety, health and wellbeing of employees. These may include unsafe working conditions or processes, environmental hazards, drug and alcohol abuse and workplace violence.

Workplace safety equally promotes the wellness of employees as well as employers. Better safety equates to  better  health.  A  safe  and  healthy  workplace  would not only ensure protection of workers from injury and illness,  but  would  also  lower  the  costs  on  account  of injury  or  illness,  reduce  absenteeism  and  increase turnover, productivity and quality; and keep the morale of  the  employees  high.  Healthier  employees  do  tasks more efficiently, and they are happier in general. There are very few accidents in a safe working environment. Thus,  safety  is  not  only  good  but  also  desirable  for business.

In this unit, you will learn about the workplace safety standards to have a hazard-free work environment and avoid loss of man-hours because of disruption caused by personal injuries and hazardous system failures.

The unit covers the following major topics:

- · Precautionary  measures  to  be  followed  by  a housekeeping attendant to avoid work hazards.
- · Standard safety procedures followed by the housekeeping department in the hotels.

## sessioN 1: PreveNtioN of WorkPlace Hazards

This  chapter  reviews  some  of  the  common  causes  of workplace  injuries  and  explores  the  methods  of  injury prevention that can be used effectively by hotels.

## Assessment of Hazards

Risk assessment is a systematic method of considering all the activities to be carried out at the workplace, assessing what could possibly go wrong which could lead to injuries or  accidents  and  deciding  on  suitable  preventive  and control measures. These measures should aim to prevent, eliminate, reduce or minimise the risks of loss, damage or injury at the workplace .

For  assessing  the  various  hazards,  the  organisation should initiate a hazard control programme that lists all of  the  steps  necessary  to  protect  workers  from  exposure to a harmful substance or system. Secondly it includes a written policy outlining the methods that would be used to control the exposure and the procedure to monitor the control mechanism.

## Minimising Hazards at Workplace

Nowadays  accidents  are  common  at  workplace.  Many workers lost their life due to workplace injury. So, necessary steps must be taken to reduce the chances of injuries in working area. Follow the given steps of minimising hazards:

- 1. Communicating with staff about health and safety
- 2. Risk assessment
- 3. Promptly dealing with hazards
- 4. Invite feedback from staff on safety improvements
- 5. Display safety information clearly
- 6. Maintain comfort and cleanliness
- 7. Provide first-aid supplies
- 8. Meet fire safety standards
- 9. Learn from any mistakes
- 10. Keep safety procedures updated

## Hazard Analysis

It is a good practice to establish systematic procedures for  the  identification,  evaluation  and  control  of  both existing and potential hazards at the workplace. Employers should identify workplace hazards by reviewing both routine and non-routine activities carried out  by  workers  and  contractors,  and  the  equipment used. These hazards can be evaluated by considering the probable incidents that can occur. Measures can be developed to control the  hazards.  Before  implementation, it is advisable to test the feasibility of the recommended measures.  Documentation  of  the  hazard  evaluation process is useful.

## Safe Work Procedures for Housekeeping Staff

Employers  are  encouraged  to  establish safe work procedures for the various types of work carried out in the hotel. Wherever possible, these procedures should be incorporated into the standard operating procedures for  staff  to  follow.  Safe  work  procedures  should  be effectively communicated to all the staff.

## Safety work procedure required at workplace

- 1. Do not work on any equipment if it is under repair and maintenance.

## Notes

<!-- image -->

- 2. Do not work at a place where there is a risk of falling or skidding.
- 3. Do not work in a cluttered or congested place.
- 4. Work carefully when there is use of fire or high heat.
- 5. Make sure that there is no explosive or flammable substance in an area where cooking is taking place.
- 6. Maintenance  or  repair  work  on  any  pressure vessel or lifting equipment.

## Points to remember for safety

Some  other  points  adopted  for  ensuring  safety  at workplace are as follows:

- 1. Safety training
- 2. Group Meetings
- 3. Accident, incident and disease investigation and analysis.
- 4. In-house safety rules and regulations

## Standard Safety Procedure

The standard safety procedure means a set of written instructions  that  document  a  routine  or  repetitive  activity followed  by  a  Hotel.  Standard  Operating  Procedure (SOP) helps in maintaining quality and consistency of service and standards in the hotel. The development and use of SOPs are an integral part of a successful quality

system as it provides individuals with the information to perform a job properly, and facilitates consistency in the quality and integrity of a product. It is must that all newly recruited hotel staff should be given training on hotels SOP. When some hazardous situations take place, the following evacuation procedures are performed by the hotels.

## Hotel  evacuation  procedures  for  fire,  bomb threats and mass destruction

All  the  departments  follow  evacuation  directions  in hotel's emergency and evacuation binder as follows:

## Front office, Manager on Duty (MoD) and Private Branch Exchange (PBX)

- 1. Notify the PBX operator, engineering personnel, hotel security and hotel accounting department about  your  intent  and  reason  for  evacuating the building.
- 2. Give  hotel  address  and  house  count  to  the operator.
- 3. Hit 'hot keys' to initiate the printing of emergency backup reports on high speed printer.
- 4. Recall all the elevators to ground floor.
- 5. Activate evacuation alarm.
- 6. Make evacuation announcement on hotel public address system.
- 7. Release E-key (emergency key) from vault to hotel security or fire or police chief at the scene.
- 8. Lock down all the safes, vaults and cash drawers. Do not take money or valuables with you.
- 9. Identify  the  rooms  with  disabled  guests.  Send personnel to assist them in evacuating or waiting for fire department assistance.
- 10. Send personnel to each hotel floor to direct guests and staff to emergency exits.
- 11. Answer calls from guestroom phones only as time and personnel permit.
- 12. Close  the  pipeline  to  lobby,  gas  or  fireplace  (if applicable).

- 13. Move  all  the  bell  carts  away  from  lobby  exits. Place them against walls.
- 14. Have  valets  and  door  personnel  move  all  the vehicles away  from  entrances and  sides of building.
- 15. Front Office manager or Manager on duty collects the in-house registration bucket and MOD keys and reports to police or fire command post.

## Housekeeping or laundry

- 1. Room  attendants  place  housekeeping  carts  in closet or guestrooms. Do not leave them in the hallway.
- 2. Laundry  personnel  turn  off  all  the  equipment. Close gas pipelines to laundry.
- 3. Check all storage rooms in the basement, lock down  all  the  storage  rooms  and  on-premise laundry.
- 4. Housekeeping and laundry personnel carry out blankets,  sheets  and  bathrobes  for  evacuating guests.

## Food and beverage

- 1. A kitchen personnel turns off all the stoves, ovens and other cooking implements.
- 2. Turn off main gas valve to the kitchen. Check all coolers and walk-ins for personnel.
- 3. Secure all the monetary funds.
- 4. Have  restaurant, lounge, banquet  personnel direct the guests to emergency exits.
- 5. Check restaurant and lobby restrooms for guests and employees. Then, exit the building and report to marshalling point.

## Security

- 1. Collect all the available master guestroom keys from the key distribution centre.
- 2. Lock down the security office and key distribution centre.
- 3. Ask the security desk to pull all the time cards or print 'clocked in' employee list.

- 4. Bring  the  timecards,  and  list  to  marshalling point  outside  the  hotel  for  Human  Resources to  take  roll  call  of  the  employees.  Take  master keys and E-key to police or fire command post for distribution to emergency personnel.

## Engineering

- 1. Turn off all the HVAC systems to hotel.
- 2. Ensure that the fire pump and sprinkler generator are on standby.
- 3. Check all mechanical and storage rooms for personnel. Lock down mechanical and storage rooms.
- 4. Assist in evacuating the guests. Exit the building, report  to  the  Chief  Engineer,  the  Engineer  on Duty takes hotel blueprints, schematics to police or fire command post.

## Material handling and storage

Housekeeping  employees  may  also  move  furniture, equipment and various tools to complete a task. If it is deemed necessary to handle materials manually after a  hazard  assessment  has  been  done,  the  employee should  be  coached  about  how  to  prevent  a  strain  or sprain injury. Employees should be encouraged to lift the amount of weight that is comfortable. If the weight of  an  object  seems  excessive,  assistance  should  be obtained. If lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying objects is not absolutely necessary, don't move it. Some tools

that  make  material  handling  easier  include housekeeping carts, mop buckets with wheels, removable  ramps,  water  pick  up  machines, and portable vacuum packs.

## Safe lifting techniques

As a part of accident prevention, we want to provide education to everyone on safe lifting techniques in order to prevent back injuries.

## Quick lifting tips

- · Before  lifting,  make  sure  your  path is  dry  and  clear  of  objects  that  could cause a fall.

<!-- image -->

Fig. 7.1: Safe lifting of material

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Notes

<!-- image -->

- · Bend  your  knees  and  keep  your  back  straight. (Lift with your legs, not your back.)
- · Bring the load close to your body.
- · Lift in a slow, even motion.
- · Don't  twist  your  body.  If  you  must  turn,  move your feet.
- · Keep  your  back  straight  when  putting  down the load.

The weight of the objects you lift is an important factor in determining your risk of injury, and you will want to be especially careful when lifting heavy items such as storage boxes full of files and boxes of photocopy papers. However, weight is not the only thing that determines your risk of injury.

## More on lifting techniques

- 1. Keep the load close.
- 2. Avoid lifting from the floor.
- 3. Plan ahead.
- 4. Get help when you need it.

## Storage of acids and chemicals

The chemicals should be stored properly in the storage area. Many of the chemicals require cool and dry place for  their  storage  or  as  per  the  company  instructions. There should be a separate area for keeping hazardous chemicals for safety purpose. There should be proper ventilation in the area where the chemicals are kept and control the toxic fumes. Also, the chemicals should be kept in a locked room and must not be easily accessible.

## Labeling  and  warning  sign  used  for  chemical storage

Labeling each container containing hazardous substance, such as bleach solution and caustic cleaner, is the most direct means of hazard communication. If it is not reasonably practicable to put full information on a container, the container should at least be labeled with the identity of the chemical and the hazard group(s) and symbol(s). Other required information can be given in an information sheet placed in the close vicinity. Statutory

requirements for labeling of dangerous substances are prescribed in the factories and industrial undertakings.

The label should include the following information

- · Identity of the substance-chemical name(s) and/ or common name(s)
- · Hazard classification and symbol(s)
- · An indication of the particular risks inherent in the substance
- · An indication of the required safety precautions

## Handling furniture

In  addition  to  using  furniture  wisely,  it  is  important to  handle  it  carefully.  Safe  handling  and  moving  of furniture  begin  with  a  basic  understanding  of  how  a piece is constructed.

Following  points  are  to  be  kept  in  mind  while handling, lifting and moving the furniture:

- 1. Before picking up a piece of furniture, determine how it is put together and if any of its parts are removable or detachable.
- 2. Make sure where the furniture is its strongestgenerally along a major horizontal element, and try to carry it from these points.
- 3. Examine  the  room  and  the  route  whereby  the furniture is to be moved. Look around to make sure you know where everything is to be placed.
- 4. Identify  potential  trouble.  Light  fixtures  that hang low, for example, or that extend out from the wall may be damaged or cause damage.
- 5. Glass  table  tops  are  also  easily  damaged  if bumped  into.  If  necessary,  clear  the  way  by moving or removing fragile or obstructive items.
- 6. Protect  the  furniture  to  be  moved  with  soft padding  or  wrap  it  in  a  blanket  pad.  Padding, which will provide extra insurance against bumping and gouging, is especially important if an item is going into storage.
- 7. Before  moving  an  item  make  sure  you  know exactly where it goes next. Plan ahead to adjust the temperature and relative humidity in the new

- location so that they are same as the place where the furniture is kept presently. Extreme changes in temperature and humidity can cause splitting of joints and veneers.
- 8. Never  hurry  when  you  are  moving  furniture. Scratches, dents and gouges from bumps against hand truck,  doorways,  and  other  furniture  are always more likely to occur in haste. Each item needs  to  be  approached  individually,  without haste, and with sufficient manpower present.
- 9. Make  sure  you  have  a  firm  grip  on  the  piece with both hands. Do not wear cotton gloves. It is essential that your hands do not slip from the piece of furniture while it is being moved.
- 10. Never slide or drag furniture along the floor. The vibration  can  loosen  or  break  joints,  chip  feet, break legs, etc., dragging also causes damage to the carpeting or polish on the floor. Whenever possible, use trolleys or dollies for transporting heavy pieces. Handling valuable  furnishings  requires  a  special attitude: in general, movement should be carried out at a slower pace. Just as gymnasts work with 'spotters' to catch them when they misstep, have helpers on hand to guide the movers so they don't crash into walls or pieces of furniture.

## Lifting furniture

Ability to lift may  be  increased  if  you  have  been appropriately trained in lifting techniques, or, it may be considerably reduced during ill health or if the working environment  conditions  are  in  any  way  adverse,  e.g. too hot or cold, slippery and uneven floors, making it difficult to grab the load.

The risk of injury increases as the weight of the load increases.  However,  the  risk  comes  not  just  from  the weight  of  the  object  being  handled  but  also  the  way it  is  handled,  e.g.  twisting,  reaching  or  repeating  a task frequently.

Consider the following points

- · Where is the load going?

- · Can handling aids be used?
- · Is a team lift required?
- · Can  the  lift be completed  without  awkward stooping or twisting movements?
- · Remove  any  obstructions  or  tripping  hazards from the route.
- · Plan resting places if the load is to be moved for a long distance.
- · Consider  the  use  of  protective  equipment  e.g. gloves, boots, etc.
- · Place the feet apart, giving a stable base for lifting.
- · Avoid  tight  clothing  or  unsuitable  footwear  e.g. high heels.
- · Placing  one  leg  forward  to  the  other  will  help improve the balance and control.
- · If a close approach to the load is not possible, try sliding it towards you before attempting to lift it.
- · Bend your knees (not your back).
- · Keep your back straight.
- · Keep  your  shoulders  leveled  facing  the  same direction as your hips.
- · Grip the load with your palms, rather than just your fingers. Keep your arms close to your body to help support the load.

## Handling electrical tools

An electrically safe work condition will be achieved and verified by the following process:

- 1. Clean  electrical  appliances  regularly  to  avoid the build-up of dust and spilled or burnt foods (in  case  of  kitchen  appliances).  When  cleaning your appliances though, never use detergents or spray insecticides on them as these might cause cracking and result in an electrical hazard.
- 2. Never  attempt  to  fix  appliances  by  yourself. Contact your trusted electrician instead. Discard the appliances that have been immersed in water and  never  use  them  again.  Also  discard  any damaged extension cords.

Fig. 7.2: Use of lifting aid

- 3. Determine all  the  possible  sources  of  electrical supply  to  the  specific  equipment.  Check  the applicable  up-to  date  drawings,  diagrams  and identification tags.
- 4. Go  through  the  electrical  tool manufacturer manual  so  we  can  understand  how  to  operate it correctly  and  safely.  Never  touch  electrical appliances  when  hands  are  wet  and  feet  are bare.  Unplug  the  electrical  equipments  before performing housekeeping duties like switch of the table lamp, mini fridge, and electrical tea kettle, air conditioner, bathroom hairdryer, geyser, etc.  Wear  rubber  or  plastic  soled  shoes  when using electrical appliances, especially if you are stepping on concrete floors and when outdoors.
- 5. Never use a faulty or ageing appliance as this may have a broken plug or frayed cord. Turn off the power points before unplugging the appliances. Never put metal plates or aluminium foil inside your  microwave.  Always  switch  off  and  unplug the toaster before taking anything out. Be extra careful when using electrical appliances attached to power outlets near kitchen or bathroom sinks, tubs, swimming pools and other wet areas.

## Cleaning floors

Following points are to be kept in mind while cleaning floor safely:

- 1. Choose slip-resistant flooring
- 2. Use  slip-resistant  treatments  for  the  existing flooring
- 3. Clean the floors properly
- 4. Maintain good housekeeping

## Handling sharp tools (knife, blade or needles)

Sharp  objects  or  any  devices  having  sharp  points  or protuberances or cutting edges, capable of cutting or piercing  the  skin  are  called  tools.  Examples  of  sharp tools  may  include-  needles,  scalpel  blades,  broken glass, razor blades or other similar objects.

## Procedure  for  handling  knife,  blade  or  needles safety

- 1. Wear  proper  safety  gear;  eyewear,  gloves  and sleeves. Use the proper tool for the job. Inspect the tools prior to use.
- 2. Keep  the  work  area  clear.  Keep  tools  under control at all times. Keep the item you are cutting secured; do not hold items to be cut in hand while cutting.
- 3. Use a sharp blade; a dull blade requires greater force, increasing potential hazards. Replace the blades when they become dull; use caution when disposing  of  used  blades  (e.g.,  use  approved sharp objects container or wrap the cutting edge with heavy tape).
- 4. Stand in a well-balanced position. Pull the blade toward you when cutting a horizontal surface.
- 5. Make  sure  the  path  of  the  cut  is  clear,  and keep the non-cutting hand out of the path of the cut.
- 6. When cutting thick material, use several passes of the blade and apply more downward pressure with each pass. Never use a cutting blade as a screwdriver, pry bar or chisel.
- 7. Don't leave the exposed blades unattended; use self-retracting cutting blades. When appropriate, use  rounded  tip  cutting  blades  rather  than pointed tip blades.
- 8. Maintain proper storage or use a separate drawer for sharp cutting tools. Keep cutting tools in a closed position or covered with a protective sheath. Use flat surface holding and protective wear while using such sharp tools.

| Crisis and  incident | and procedures for dealing with them and their periodic testing  and review.  2.  All hotels must develop and test a general Crisis Management Plan  which must be updated as necessary. This plan must include the  contact details and responsibilities of both a Crisis Management  Team and one or more contacts to be used in emergencies. 3.  Response Teams-each hotel must also develop and test specific  response plans for a range of foreseeable crisis and incidents. An  example of such a plan is available on the IHG Risk Management  website. |

- 1.  All  the  hotels  must  develop  and  test  a  fire  emergency  and evacuation plan. All the employees must receive training at least once  every  six  months  in  the  emergency  and  evacuation  plan, the  use  of  fire  safety  equipment  and  fire  prevention  except  for Night staff, 'Living in' staff and Newly engaged staff who may be required to be trained more frequently as required by the local code. Written records of such training must be maintained and be available on request.
- 2.  Evacuation drills must be held at least once every six months. Annually one of the drills must involve the use of fire alarm and detection system. Guests must be notified in advance of the drill.
- 3.  Evacuation  procedures  must  be  identified  and  developed  for disabled guests.

All hotels shall endeavour to reduce the risk of fire to employees, guests, visitors and other stakeholders through the completion of 'Fire Risk Assessments' and the development of fire safety procedures and the periodic review of those procedures.

- 1.  The structure of all hotels must have a fire resistance of not less than 60 minutes including between:
- · Public areas and guestrooms or guest corridors
- · Back of house areas and guestrooms or guest corridors
- · Guestrooms and adjoining rooms
- · Plant rooms  and all other areas (air conditioning plant, walk-in freezer rooms, generator plants, water treatment or garbage treatment plant)
- 2.  All  unprotected openings between floors and through walls (for example, around pipes or wire chases, ducts or service junctions) must be covered with heavy insulating material in order to prevent risk of fire to the surrounding structure.

## Workplace inspection

The purpose of conducting safety measures inspection is  that  they  give  employees  an  opportunity  to  point out  the  deficiencies  in  their  area  that  may  otherwise go  unnoticed and uncorrected. Safety inspections are conducted primarily not to find out how many things are  wrong,  but  rather,  to  determine  if  things  are satisfactory.  Their  secondary  purpose  is  to  discover the  conditions  that,  when  corrected,  will  bring  the facility up to accepted and approved standards and/or regulations. As a consequence, the inspected facilities should become safer places to work.

Conducting  safety  inspection  is  a  basic  tool  for establishing and maintaining safe conditions and discovering  unsafe  practices  at  the  workplace.  Systematic inspections  are  practical  ways  to  identify  and  correct an unsafe equipment, conditions, processes, and work practices. If unsafe conditions and practices are found to  exist,  prompt  corrective  actions  are  initiated.  They are an excellent way to prevent accidents from occurring and to safeguard employees.

## Purpose of workplace inspection

As  an  essential  part  of  a  health  and  safety  program, workplaces should be inspected. Inspections are important as they allow you to:

- · listen to the concerns of workers and supervisors
- · gain further understanding of jobs and tasks
- · identify the existing and potential hazards
- · determine underlying causes of hazards
- · monitor hazard controls (personal protective equipment,  engineering  controls,  policies  and procedures)
- · recommend corrective action

## Adopting Zero Accident Vision at Workplace

Zero Accident Vision is a philosophy which states that nobody  should  be  injured  due  to  an  accident.  Every hotel  professional's  ultimate  goal  is  zero  accidents. Here are ten steps that can help you achieve this critical objective.

- 1. Make sure everyone is committed to safety: Everyone in the organisation, from top management to the  newest  employee,  must  be committed to safety making it the top priority.
- 2. Set  clear  standards  for  workplace  safety performance: Make sure that employees understand  the  rules  and  that  the  supervisor enforce them.
- 3. Take  the  lead: Explain  it  to  supervisors  and managers  the  importance  of  setting  a  good example and following all the safety rules themselves-for  example,  wearing  proper  PPE and  taking  the  same  precautions  as  workers. Furthermore, supervisors should lead the effort in hunting down hazards and correcting them.
- 4. Get employees  involved: Give workers  the responsibility for planning and conducting inspections, for analysing their own data on work hazards, and for designing safety checklists.

## Notes

<!-- image -->

- 5. Promote understanding: Emphasise that hazards  put  employees'  personal  health  and safety at risk. Understanding the need of safety is a strong motivator.
- 6. Train  for  competence  and  safety: Train  the employees well and frequently. Make sure that they have the information and develop the skills they need to prevent accidents.
- 7. Encourage feedback: Welcome the input from employees. Praise the workers who identify and correct  hazards,  or  who  report  problems  they can't fix.
- 8. Learn from the accidents for future safety: Once  the  hazards  are  identified,  use  them  as learning  experiences  to  help  workers  become more alert and more sensitive to potential danger on the job.
- 9. Move  swiftly to correct safety problems: Make sure you respond promptly to the identified  hazards  and  take  immediate  steps  to correct them.
- 10. View  accident  prevention  as  an  ongoing challenge: It is something that the supervisors and employees have to focus on every day, always improving, always setting new safety objectives, and  always  making  steady  progress  towards achieving them.

## First-aid

The employer is to  provide  adequate  and  appropriate equipment,  facilities  and  personnel  to  ensure  that employees  receive immediate  attention  if they get injured  at  the  workplace.  These  regulations  apply  to all  workplaces  including  those  with  fewer  than  five employees  and  to  the  self-employed.  Ensuring  that the first-aid requirements of staff can be met requires sufficient  first-aid  provision  at  the  workplace.  This means the dispersal of information for employees about giving first-aid, as well as the availability of a first-aid kit that's fit for the purpose.

The standard safety guide of first-aid can be used to ascertain which type of first-aid kit is necessary at

that particular working environment. A first-aid kit is available in different sizes- small, medium and large.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  employer  to  make  a first-aid  needs  assessment  so  that  the  contents  of each individual kit may vary according to respective workplace's requirements. The low hazard environment includes shops and offices, while a high hazard environment includes warehouses, factories and construction  sites.  In  circumstances,  where  the  sites are far off from emergency medical services, paramedics at hand and more than one first-aid kit may be required.

Housekeeping attendant has a duty to take reasonable  care  of  their  own  health  and  safety  and must not adversely affect the health and safety of other persons.  Housekeeping  attendant  must  comply  with all the instructions and cooperate as per the policy or procedure relating to health and safety at the workplace, such as procedure of first-aid and for reporting injuries and illnesses.

## First-aid kit material

At  places  where  there  are  unusual  hazards  that  are specific  to  a  particular  workplace  environment,  the first-aid  kits  should  be  supplemented  with  additional and appropriate components. Expired or soon-to-expire tablets or medicines should not be included in first-aid kits.  It  is  very  important  for  the  employers  to  ensure that  they  provide  immediate  and  appropriate  fist-aid help to employees, as well as supporting employees as per their work-related health issue.

Although there is no mandatory list of items to be included in a first-aid kit, a suggested stock of first-aid items in a low hazard workplace might be:

- 1. A leaflet on general first-aid
- 2. Medium sterile dressings and large sterile dressings
- 3. Assorted plasters relevant for the work area
- 4. Triangular bandage
- 5. Safety pins
- 6. Sterile eye pads
- 7. Disposable gloves

Other useful items that can be included could be:

- 1. Saline cleansing wipes
- 2. Roll or adhesive tape
- 3. Sterile adhesive dressing
- 4. Resuscitation face shield with valve

## First-aid documentation procedure

- 1. First-aid  boxes  are  kept  in  the  Housekeeping Manager's desk, control desk, and at the other areas  according  to  their  need.  For  a  qualified first-aider,  contact  the  Housekeeping  Manager. In  their  absence,  the  supervisors  will  act  as appointed persons, call the emergency services and ensure the comfort of any injured person.
- 2. Notices  are  placed  around  the  premises  with regards  to  first-aid.  A  record  of  first-aid  will be  kept  on  the  appropriate  form  (Health  and Safety file).
- 3. Hotel staff must not take it upon themselves to render  first-aid  and  must  seek  the  first-aiders or appointed persons. Emergency telephone numbers are displayed on the first-aid notice.

## Record of first-aid treatment

Supervisors are required to complete this form and keep a record of all the circumstances related to the accident as described by the injured worker.

Careful  selection  and  use  of  adequate  PPE  should protect  individuals  involved  in  chemical  emergencies from  hazards  effecting  the  respiratory  system,  skin, eyes,  face,  hands,  feet,  head,  body  and  hearing.  No single combination of protective equipment and clothing is  capable of protecting against all the hazards. Thus PPE should be used in conjunction with other protective methods, including exposure control procedures and equipment.

To ensure the greatest possible protection for employees at the workplace, cooperative efforts of both employers and employees will help in establishing and maintaining a safe and healthful work environment.

## In general, hotel staffs are responsible for:

- · Performing a 'hazard assessment' of the workplace to identify and  control physical and  health hazards.
- · Identifying  and  providing  appropriate  PPE  for employees.
- · Training employees in the use and care of the PPE.
- · Maintaining  PPE,  including  replacing  worn  or damaged PPE.

## Notes

- · Periodically  reviewing,  updating  and  evaluating the effectiveness of the PPE programme.

In general, the employees should:

- · Properly wear PPE
- · Attend training sessions on PPE
- · Care for, clean and maintain PPE
- · Inform  a  supervisor  of  the  need  to  repair  or replace PPE

## Use of PPE for a specific task

Personal protective equipment provides protection against hazards, and is used when the required safety measures are either not available or are deficient and insufficient.  In  a  hotel,  the  PPE  of  room  attendants include gloves, non-slip footwear, masks, goggles and kneepads.  The  gloves  are  used  when  the  attendants clean  room  or  change  the  bedsheet  from  the  bed  or change the pillow cover or while making the bed and while emptying the bins. While cleaning the guest room or  bathroom,  the  room  attendants  wear  non-slippery footwear, to avoid any accident in the bathroom or at any  other  slippery  place.  Mask  and  goggles  are  used while  dusting  at  a  height  and  kneepads  are  used when the room attendant is working while sitting  on one's knee.

## Safety Signs and Symbols at Workplace

These  signs  are  prescribed  in  the  'Health  and  safety (safety  signs  and  signals)  regulations  IS  9457  (2005): Safety  colours  and  safety  signs-  Code  of  Practice' [CHD  8:  Occupational  Safety,  Health  and  Chemical Hazards].

They are used to give health and safety information, prohibition, warning, or to take a specific safety action using  a  sign  or  symbol.  Generally  the  symbols  are displayed with short text (e.g., 'no smoking' or 'fire exits').

Employers  need  to  ensure  that  the  employees  are aware of and understand the meaning of safety signs. Although  most  are  self-explanatory,  some  employees, particularly the newly recruited, may be unfamiliar with the less commonly used signs.
