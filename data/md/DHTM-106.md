## ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING

The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## INTRODUCTION TO HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT

## Block Introduction :

This block intends to introduce housekeeping department, its importance, functions, and responsibilities. The layout of housekeeping is discussed along with functions of different sections in housekeeping department. You will also study  the  ways  in  which  housekeeping  department  co-ordinates  with  other departments in a hotel. The operational part relating to the housekeeping is dependent  upon  the  co-ordination  of  various  sub-departments  within  the housekeeping department.

For smooth and efficient functioning of the housekeeping department, it coordinates with several other departments in the hotel such as front office, personnel, purchase, engineering, laundry, food and beverage, security and stores so that no inconvenience is caused to the guest during their stay in the hotel.

The  job  of  housekeeping  department  in  a  hotel  is  related  to  various departments and their requirement according to a planned schedule, which is made or framed as per the convenience and requirement of other departments. In this unit, basic concept related to hotel housekeeping is developed which will help later in learning various activities conducted in a hotel and other hotel operations. The units in this block also state the importance of the housekeeping department of the hotel and mention its duties and responsibilities.

As  this  department  and  the  staff  in  this  department  are  very  closely associated with the guest and the guest rooms, it is very important to the personnel department to check and verify the pre-determined quality standards to avoid any further problems and queries. It is also essential to know the qualities that a housekeeping  staff  must  possess  for  the  purpose  of  recruitment,  induction, training, and self-development programmes. These attributes sometimes override the importance of skill as skills can be taught but these personnel traits should be inherent in a member of the staff.

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION  :

In a hotel 'Housekeeping Department' is the backbone of the hotel. It is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance, and aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. The  housekeeping  department  plays  an  important  role  in  keeping  a  clean, comfortable, and safe house (hotel). It is an extension of basic home keeping multiplied  into  commercial  proportions.  The  housekeeping  department  takes pride in making image building for their guests in keeping the hotel clean and comfortable as well as to create a 'home away from home'. To live up to this image in the hotel housekeeping take this task on their shoulders unlike a lady takes care of the house to keep it clean and neat.' This tradition leaded to hotels as well where the housekeeper is, in most cases, a woman.

The concept of housekeeping is simplistic and very easy to imagine the work but when it comes to maintaining a 'house' of several hundred rooms and numerous public areas, the task becomes challenging and interesting. It takes a well-organized approach and technical understanding. The total percentage of profit of the hotel depends on the sale of rooms, food and beverage and other minor operating services such as the laundry, health clubs, mini-bars, shopping arcade, parlors, spas, etc. The sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 60 per cent. A hotel's largest margin of profit comes from room selling because a room, once made, can be sold repeatedly.

The room sale depends on the quality of room, interior decor, facilities, cleanliness of the room and safety. To provide a good room to the guest with an excellent appeal and to make him or her comfortable are tasks of housekeeping. It is quite natural that if guest does not feel comfortable in hotel, he will not visit again. Hence, the efforts of housekeeping department ensure clean, comfortable, and safe atmosphere for guests.

## 1.2 MEANING OF HOUSEKEEPING IN HOTEL :

On arrival, the guest enters to the entrance hall and gets an impression of the establishment from what can be seen, mainly from the appearance that it presents. From the reception desk, the guest goes to the lift, staircase, or corridor to reach the allocated room, possibly passing the lounge and other public areas. On reaching the room, the guest probably has time to explore the surroundings more closely; he or she takes a closer look at the decor, the furnishings and furniture, especially the bed and the cleanliness and comfort of the surroundings. By this time, the guest is better able to judge the standards of the establishment and to decide whether it is likely to meet with requirements and to provide satisfaction. This first impression is probably obtained before the guest has had any food or drink; in fact, the guest may neither eat nor drink in the establishment at all, therefore the basic service provided should be good and clean, comfortable with safe surroundings. In a hotel, accommodation operation earns most money and the satisfaction of the guest is of prime importance.

## 1.3 IMPORTANCE  OF  HOUSEKEEPING  DEPARTMENT  :

Housekeeping may be defined as 'provision of a clean, comfortable, safe and aesthetically appealing environment'. By another definition, 'housekeeping is an  operational  department  in  a  hotel,  which  is  responsible  for  cleanliness, maintenance,  aesthetic  upkeep  of  rooms,  public  areas,  back  areas  and  the surroundings. A hotel survives on the sale of rooms, food, beverages, and other minor services such as the laundry, health club and so on. The sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 50 per cent of these sales. Thus, a major part of a hotel's profit margin comes from room sales because a room once made can be sold repeatedly.

The effort that a housekeeping department makes in giving a guest a desirable  room  has  a  direct  bearing  on  the  guest's  experience  in  a  hotel. Guestrooms are the heart of the hotel. Unless its decor is appropriate, the air odorfree and furnishings and upholstery spotlessly clean, the hotel may lose the guest as a potential repeat customer. The housekeeping department not only prepares clean guestrooms on a timely basis for arriving guests, but also cleans and maintains everything in the hotel so that the property is as fresh and attractive as the day it opened for business. Housekeeping, thus, is an ancillary department that contributes in a big way towards the overall reputation of a property. It is rightly said that housekeeping is a 24 x 7 x 365 operation. imagine the stacks of linen needed to make up all the beds in a hotel; the huge amounts of bath soap, tissue and other amenities such as shampoos, colognes and so on that must be placed in the guestrooms; the miles of carpeting, floors, walls and ceilings to be cleaned and maintained; the countless pieces of furniture that must be dusted and polished and the barrels of cleaning compounds along with special tools and equipment needed in order to clean these. Scientific housekeeping demands the employment of the most effective cleaning materials and procedures, attention

Introduction to HouseKeeping  Department

## House  Keeping Management

to purchasing the most suitable linen and supplies, maintenance of decorative areas under the housekeeping department's purview and proper organisation and supervision. Other than hotels, professional housekeeping services are very much in demand in hospitals, on cruise liners, at offices and more. Since most such organisations  prefer  to  outsource  these  functions,  contract  housekeeping  is becoming a lucrative entrepreneurship venture these days.

- 1. Housekeeping is a department that deals essentially with cleanliness and all the ancillary services attached to that.
- 2. Cleanliness  is  foremost  for  health  and  well-being.  One  cannot  feel comfortable in an environment that is not clean and well ordered.
- 3. The hygiene of housekeeping is essential.
- 4. Housekeeping in a hotel provides the accommodation for the guests. A guest spends more time alone in the room than he spends alone in any other part of the hotel, therefore he can check on the standards of cleanliness of a room and if he does not find it clean then he would lose his confidence in the hotel and change to another one.
- 5. The guest linen provided in the room should also be of superior quality and hygienically cleaned.
- 6. Other services provided are laundry, dry-cleaning, pressing, shoe polishing, valet service etc.
- 7. Now a days in most hotels, the maximum revenue comes from the sale of rooms; therefore, stress must be paid to proper cleanliness of guest rooms and all public areas, which are in continuous contact with the guest.

## 1.5 HOUSEKEEPING  LAYOUT  :

It is not possible to consider any ideal or universal layout of housekeeping department. Because the layout of housekeeping differs from hotel to hotel, and it depends on the size of organization. However, suppose the housekeeper is involved in the planning stage, she must be told the number of function rooms and the volume of business anticipated to estimate the amount of linen required as also the types and sizes of table clothes to cater to a variety of tables. She must also determine whether the management intends to contract out horticulture, tailoring, maintenance, upholstery etc. to include or preclude space for such activities. It is important not to ask for space more than is required because space is limited and entails cost. It is necessary to carefully estimate the traffic flows and size of equipment, trolleys etc. that need to be moved around so that there is no cluttering and congestion. As a rule of thumb, the following spaces would have to be provided for the essential activities of the department.

Three lost and found slips are maintained for further efficient co-ordination. One slip remains with the item found, second goes to the lobby manager, i.e., front office department and the third remains with the housekeeping department for reference. The hotel intimates the guest of his lost item, if the hotel is sure the item belongs to the same guest or if he has enquired about the lost item, the item found is returned.

## 1.7 PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES  OF  HOUSEKEEPING  STAFF  :

The housekeeping department in a hotel may constitute the largest part of the workforce, and how they come across to guests has a direct bearing on the image of the hotel. Thus, it is essential to know what qualities housekeeping staff must possess for recruitment, induction, training, and self-development process. It is believed that these personal traits should be inherent in housekeeping staff and often override the importance of skill since skills can be taught.

Introduction to HouseKeeping  Department

## House  Keeping Management

Personal Attributes 0f Housekeeping Staff

<!-- image -->

## 1.7.1 Pleasant Personality :

The way a staff looks creates the first impression of the service quality and standards of an establishment. Staff should remember that their last look in the mirror will be the guest's first look. Guestroom attendants and their supervisors should especially be well-groomed, as they come in close contact with guests. Staff should turn out in clean and crisp uniforms. Mild deodorants should be preferred over strong aftershaves and perfumes. Hair must be clean and if long, should be tied back. Some hotels may provide caps for female attendants. Because of the long hours spent standing, housekeeping staff should wear comfortable, light, low-heeled shoes and always keep them polished and clean. Staff should avoid unhygienic mannerisms such as scratching the face or scalp and chewing gum in front of guests. A ready smile on the face would be very pleasing to guests.

## 1.7.2 Physical Fitness :

Most  of  the  work  is  manual  often  requiring  them  to  handle  heavy equipment. Physical fitness therefore is a must to cope with work and to perform to required standards.

## 1.7.3 Personal Hygiene :

Housekeeping  staff  must  maintain  the  highest  standards  of  personal hygiene since it reflects the hotel's brand standards. A daily bath is a must to avoid body odour. Hair must be well combed, nails clean and clipped. Oral hygiene always to avoid any offensive odour. Infections should be attended to immediately and reported. Cuts and burns should be medically dressed.

## 1.7.4 Eye for Detail :

Eye for detail is one of the foremost attributes that housekeeping staff must possess. The ability of critical observation distinguishes excellent service from the regular. Room attendants should develop an eye for detail to make up a flawless guestroom and housekeeping supervisors should develop a keen sense of observation to inspect these rooms for perfection. Furthermore, the whole property must be continually scrutinised by the housekeeping department for proper care and maintenance. The guest rooms are a very private place to guests, and there is a chance that somebody takes advantage of such privacy and doing illegal work. In such a situation, the housekeeper must inform security.

## 1.7.5 Cooperation :

Cooperation is essential since housekeeping involves a lot of teamwork for efficient functioning. Housekeeping staff must cooperate both within the department as  well  as  with  staff  of  other  departments.  Any  lack  of  cooperation  and coordination will indirectly affect the guests and hamper efficiency.

## 1.7.6 Adaptability :

Adaptability is an essential quality in housekeeping staff. They should be willing to learn new ways and train in new skills. Accepting and adapting to change willingly will keep them at the sharp end of their profession.

## 1.7.7 Honesty :

Housekeeping staff have direct access to guestrooms. Guests' belongings are often left lying around the room, and temptations are great. Housekeeping staff also deal with various kinds of guest amenities that may also tempt them. This quality is all-important to the staff in dealings with both guests and the management. It is inherent discipline and integrity that checks these temptations. If there is trust and respect across the triangle of staff, guests and management relationships, there will be a work atmosphere that encourages efficiency and a good team spirit.

## 1.7.8 Right Attitude :

The candidate with a good attitude displays an even temper, courtesy and good humour and does not betray displeasure even in difficult times. They learn from their mistakes and are always optimistic. The employee with the right attitude is proactive and anticipates the guest's needs and wishes.

## 1.7.9 Courtesy :

It is essential that while dealing with guests, the staff be humble and polite. A housekeeping employee should extend courtesy to both guests and colleagues. Housekeeping staff should never argue with a guest and, if they cannot deal with the situation, it should be referred immediately to a senior member of the team. Guests will never forget pleasant and charming staff, as this adds to the guest's positive experience in a hotel.

## 1.7.10  Good Memory :

Good memory is an essential quality in housekeeping staff, mainly when dealing with regular guests and repeat customers. A staff member who remembers a guest's likes, dislikes, needs, and wishes will be a tremendous asset to the hotel.

Introduction to HouseKeeping  Department

## House  Keeping Management

## 1.7.11 Punctuality :

Punctuality is an essential quality of housekeeping staff. If an employee is continually late for duty, it shows a lack of interest in the work and respect for the management and guests. Respect for time during working hours will reflect on the employee's work and help create an impression.

## 1.7.12 Tact and Diplomacy

Housekeeping staff come into close contact with various kinds of guests. Some guests may make unusual requests or complaints. It requires a lot of tact and diplomacy on the part of housekeeping staff to handle such guests at their level since under no circumstances can they be rude to a guest or hurt their sentiments. Staff needs to be trained in handling guests who make such requests.

## 1.8 COORDINATION WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS :

A willingness to cooperate and coordinate, with the assistance of efficient methods of communication, is essential if the establishment is to run smoothly. The housekeeping department is one of the departments in a hotel that is working towards the guests' satisfaction. Each department is dependent on others for information and services. The housekeeping department primarily coordinates with the front office and maintenance. The most critical coordination is between the front office, housekeeping, and maintenance. Hotels depend on this triangle to create a perfect image.

The various departments housekeeping coordinates

<!-- image -->

## 1.8.1 Coordination with The Front Office :

One of the essential departments in the hotel is the front office. It is the department that first meets the guest. Rooms are of chief concern to the front office  and  housekeeping  departments.  The  departments  need  to  exchange information on room status continuously. The front office must provide lists for expected arrivals and departures in advance and notify housekeeping about actual arrivals and departures as and when they occur. The front office cannot assign guestrooms until the rooms have been cleaned, inspected, and released by the housekeeping department.

Every night, a front office assistant produces an 'occupancy report'. It is also called a 'night report'. This report list helps to know an expected check out of the day. The executive housekeeper procures and consults this list early the following day and schedules the occupied rooms for cleaning. As guests check out, the front office notifies housekeeping. Housekeeping ensures that these rooms are given top priority in servicing so that clean rooms are available for sale. If a guest checks out before the stated departure date, the front office must inform housekeeping that the room is no longer a stay-over but is now a checkout. To ensure efficient rooming of guests, both housekeeping and the front office must inform each other of changes in a room's status. Knowing whether a room is occupied, vacant, on change, out of order (OOO), under repair or similar, is vital for proper rooms management. A flow of information in the reverse direction is also necessary, primarily through the 'room status report' or the 'housekeeping status report'. At the end of a shift, the housekeeping department prepares the housekeeping status report, which indicates the physical count to be tallied by the front office. This report indicates the current housekeeping status of each room.

Housekeeping must inform the front office about rooms that are ready for occupation and out of order or under repair. The room status report is compared with the front office's occupancy report, and discrepancies are brought to the attention of the front office manager. A room status discrepancy is a situation in which the housekeeping department's description of a room's status differs from the room status information being used by the front office to assign guestrooms. As unoccupied rooms are cleaned and inspected, the floor supervisors call the housekeeping desk attendant, who informs the front office of ready rooms. The front  office  then  updates  the  room's  status  to  'vacant  and  ready'.  Promptly informing the front office of the housekeeping status of rooms is a tremendous aid  in  getting  guests  who  arrive  early  registered,  especially  during  highoccupancy  or  sold-out  periods.  Keeping  room  status  information  up  to  date requires close coordination between the front desk and housekeeping. The two common systems used for tracking current room status are the manual Whitney room-rack systems and the computerised room status systems. The front desk may use a Whitney room rack to track the status of rooms. In this system, a roomrack slip containing the guest's name and other relevant information is prepared during  the  registration  process.  This  slip  is  placed  in  the  room-rack  slot corresponding to the assigned room number.

The presence of a room-rack slip in the slot indicates that the room is occupied. When the guest checks out, the rack slip is removed, and the room's status now indicates 'on change', which means the room requires housekeeping services before it can be registered to an arriving guest. Housekeeping meanwhile

Introduction to HouseKeeping  Department

## House  Keeping Management

attends to the unoccupied room and notifies the front desk, which updates the status to 'vacant and ready'.

As soon as a guest checks out, the front desk enters the departure into the computer. This information is received by housekeeping through the computer terminal located in the housekeeping department. When housekeeping is done with the cleaning and inspection of the room, it enters this information into its departmental terminal. This information is received on the front office computer terminal, and it puts the room on sale. Sharing information on occupancy levels helps forecast occupancy for the year and makes it easier to draw up a budget, establish par stock levels and estimate required staff strength. It also helps to gear renovations and spring cleaning to low-occupancy periods, thereby preventing loss of revenue.

The housekeeping department also receives other important information from the front office, which requires special care.

- · When  the  VIPs  are  in  the  house,  the  staff  can  take  extra  care  and precautions to clean and supervise VIP rooms.
- · The group room list must be provided before the group's arrival, as groups tend to move together in arrival, departure, sightseeing tours, and meals. Group rooming lists enable the department to organise their work and have their rooms ready on time.
- · Airline crews are allotted a given set of rooms on a particular floor. The arrival of a crew and the departure of another crew from the same airline may overlap. In such circumstances, the allotted rooms must be cleaned within a short period.
- · The front office needs to depend on housekeeping for the provision of clean uniforms to its staff.

## 1.8.2 Coordination with Maintenance Department :

The housekeeping department depends on maintenance to keep things in order. While carrying out their scheduled work, housekeeping employees may find some deficiencies in the hotel facilities, such as faulty electrical plugs, dripping faucets, leaking pipes, or malfunctioning air-conditioning units. The housekeeping department often takes the first steps in maintenance functions for which the maintenance department is ultimately responsible. However, these

deficiencies and faults should be immediately reported to maintenance. A need for urgent repairs is reported to maintenance over the telephone, and these requests are usually dealt with promptly if the rapport between the two departments is good.

## Work of the Maintenance Department :

- · Air conditioning and heating; fused bulbs; lights and lamps that are not functioning; defective plugs and plug points; short circuits; and faulty geysers, refrigerators, and minibars.
- · Any faulty equipment, such as vacuum cleaners, ice-cube machines and so on.
- · Faulty faucets, showers, drainage systems, water closets and so on.
- · Broken  or  shaky  furniture  mirrors  and  cupboards  in  less  than  peak condition and fresh woodwork.

Maintenance activities are related to the general upkeep of the hotel, and they occur regularly, daily, or weekly and require minimal training or skills. A systematic approach to maintenance is needed to identify and correct situations to control costs and keep more significant problems from occurring. It involves inspections, minor corrections, and initiation of work orders.

## 1.8.3 Coordination with Food and Beverage Department :

The coordination of housekeeping with the Food and Beverage department is mainly concerned with providing linen and uniforms. Under the supervision of the executive housekeeper, the linen room supervisor needs to have sufficient stock of clean linen to meet the demands of the food and beverage department's restaurant and banquet functions. The restaurant manager should ensure that the time set for the exchange of linen is respected, linen is not lost or misused, and that intimation of forthcoming banquet functions is conveyed to housekeeping well in advance. Housekeeping may also have to arrange for flower decorations for banquets.

## 1.8.4 Coordination with Stores :

Larger hotels have a store attached to the housekeeping department that stocks linen, supplies and so on. Smaller hotels may stock them in the general store  except  for  linen  stored  in  the  housekeeping  department  on  purchase. Communication with stores is through a requisition form, which housekeeping sends to stores when it requires certain items.

## 1.8.5 Coordination with Human Resource Department :

Housekeeping coordinates with the personnel department for recruitment of housekeeping staff; managing their salaries and wages; addressing indiscipline; following through grievance procedures; issuing identity cards for employees; running induction programmers; maintaining locker facilities; completing income tax formalities; effecting transfers, promotions, appraisals and exit formalities; and organising training sessions.

## 1.8.6 Coordination with Purchase Department :

The purchase department procures out-of-stock items for housekeeping, such as guest supplies and amenities, stationery, linen, cleaning materials and equipment, etc. Housekeeping should convey their requirements to purchase by way of advance notice in the form of a purchase requisition.

## Purchase Requisition Form

No. 3456

Signature of HOD :

Approved by : Finance controller

## 1.8.7 Coordination with Sales Department :

The purchase department procures out of stock items for housekeeping such as guest supplies kept in rooms, stationery, linen of various types, detergents etc. The sales and marketing department informs housekeeping of the occupancy forecast  for  the  entire  year,  broken  up  month-wise.  The  forecast  enables housekeeping to budget for the necessary expenses. The sales and marketing team also must depend on housekeeping for their uniforms. Two things are certain in the hotel business: no matter how many guests a salesperson brings in the door, the guests will not be coming back if housekeeping does not execute its function with excellence. Vice versa, no matter how well-kept the rooms, occupancy falls if  the  sales  staff  does  not  bring  potential  guests  to  the  hotel.  An  essential contribution of the housekeeping staff to hotel sales is ensuring that repeat business is obtained by providing the level of cleanliness and service that meets or exceeds guest expectations.

## 1.8.8 Coordination with Laundry :

Laundry is a department that can either enhance or mar the quality of housekeeping services. Without clean linen, the room attendants simply cannot operate. The laundry should provide an acceptable standard of service concerning laundering.  Housekeeping  also  needs  to  coordinate  with  the  laundry  about housekeeping  employees'  uniforms  and  those  of  other  departments.  During periods of full occupancy, the housekeeper needs a fast turnaround of linen from

the laundry but should not always be making an 'emergency' demand for them. As far as possible, the housekeeper should stick to the schedule for the laundry.

## 1.8.9 Coordination with Security Department :

A hotel guestroom is the most private place, and the hotel staff must ensure their guests' privacy and security. However, a guest may take advantage of this privacy  and  may  be  engaged  in  certain  illegal  activities  such  as  gambling, smuggling, etc. Housekeeping personnel must be alert to this risk and seek the security department's intervention if necessary. The coordination here is mainly concerned with preventing fire and thefts and the safekeeping of keys and lost property. There are so many security hazards on the floors that this liaison is vital, and the housekeeper cooperates by ensuring that housekeeping staff are aware of the risks. Housekeeping personnel should also report anything of a suspicious nature immediately to the security staff. The security department is responsible for conducting training sessions on handling emergencies for the staff.

## 1.14 CASE STUDY :

## Interdepartmental Coordination

Mr Motwani, the general manager of Landmark International, Goa, made a booking for Mr Larabie, who was expected to arrive on the 4th of October at 10.00 A.M. for a three-day stay. Mr Motwani knew how important the guest was. Mr Larabie was the vice president of a leading international airline; negotiations were on for their crew stays. Pleasing Mr Larabie and meeting his expectations meant around five rooms would be sold per day for the whole of next year - a business deal worth around a crore. Mr Motwani was thus very particular about meeting the guest personally. Still, he had to attend the Management Board Meeting at the head office in Mumbai on Mr Larabie's arrival. So, he called for the Front Office Manager, Mr Salim and realised that he was on leave. He then noted the guest and mentioned that his room should not have any green colour as he has an aversion to it. The message was sent to the newly appointed lobby manager, Mr Walter.

Landmark  International  was  hosting  a  three-day  National  Cardiology Conference from 5th to the 9th of October. Mr Walter, with his new job, wanted to ensure an excellent response from the cardiologists as he knew that this was a prestigious event. He was busy making arrangements for the conventions when the note from the general manager arrived. Mr Walter scribbled a note regarding Mr Larabie's stay to the executive housekeeper mentioning 'no green to be used'.

Ms Leena, the housekeeper on duty, received the note and started getting room no. 216 ready for the VIP, Mr Larabie, as instructed by Mr Walter. She noticed no green to be used and got a little confused. She finally decided that some people are allergic to plants, so no greenery by way of foliage or flowers was to be placed in this room. She had such guests before who were allergic to all  plant  material.  She  realised  how  busy  the  Front  Office  was  with  the cardiologists' conference and didn't want to trouble Mr Walter time and again.

The room was arranged, spic and span, with all the VIP amenities except flowers and indoor plants. Ms Leena herself had checked it with meticulous care, and she was sure that the welcoming VIP Suite would bowl over any VIP guest.

Mr Larabie checked in and was escorted by a Front Office Assistant to the VIP Suite. However, he was thoroughly disappointed to find the colour green in the patterns on the carpet, on the lampshades, in the mural painting of trees just above the beautifully made bed and even in the petit fours. He gave instructions to process his check out and decided that if the hotel could not follow a simple request of his, his crew were not likely to be in a relaxed state of mind before their next flight if they stayed here. He didn't put in a formal complaint but decided the status of the contract.

## Questions :

- 1. What decision do you think Mr Larabie made about the contract with Landmark International ?
- 2. What communication links between Mr Motwani, Mr Walter and Ms Leena would have ensured the decision was swung in Landmark International's favour ?
- 3. Which personal attributes do you find missing in the staff involved ?
- 4. Can Mr Motwani still do anything to clinch the deal ?

## 2.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we have discussed the hotel housekeeping human resource issues, employees' recruiting resources and procedures, and the selection process. The scheduling and training process of the housekeeping staff with the development of employee work schedules and the methods motivating the employees.

- After working through this unit, you should be able to :
- · Describe internal and external sources of recruiting with creative recruiting tactics.
- · Know the factors that should be considered when selecting employees.
- · List down the steps of the training procedure.
- · Describe the challenges of scheduling employees.
- · Identify several methods of motivating employees.

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Employees are the lifeline of the hospitality operation. Without them, the operation would stop; hence management must recruit the right employees and provide them with proper training as per their job requirements. Training is a vital component in today's busy housekeeping department, where the provision of the skill should meet or exceed the guest's expectations.

Training is a continuous process with more practical information providing employees with a mature working environment. Executive housekeeper needs to focus on effective scheduling and motivate employees for better performance.

This unit will focus on human resource issues, like recruiting, selecting, training and motivational techniques and methods.

## 2.2 RECRUITING EMPLOYEES :

In  the  employee  recruitment  procedure,  applicants  are  screened  and selected based on their suitability for the required position in the operation. The method  involves  declaring  the  job  vacancies  through  proper  channels,  then interviewing and selecting the given positions.

In bigger properties, the human resource department assists the executive housekeeper in hiring the right candidate. Hence the housekeeper is involved in interviewing, reference check and selection process.

## 2.2.1 Types of Recruitment Sources :

<!-- image -->

Internal Recruiting : Hiring employees from within the organisation to fill a vacant position within a department. This method of recruitment helps the management in the following ways :

- · It helps to improve the confidence level of the promoted employee.
- · It helps build up the confidence level of other employees working in the department who seek such opportunities for themselves.
- · Since the performance level of the promoted candidate has already been observed, it is easier to assess over time.
- · Less of cost than external recruiting.

External Recruiting : It is hiring employees from outside the organisation. It is best suited when the management hires for the entry-level as it is easier for the managers to evaluate the skill required for the position. This method of recruitment helps the management in the following ways:

- · It brings in a new flow of ideas into the organisation.
- · It  allows  the  employer  while  selecting  potential  applicants  from  the competitive set of hotels directly or indirectly.

## Managing Housekeeping Human  Resource

## House  Keeping Management

- · It helps in avoiding political disturbances within the department due to internal recruitment.

Online  Recruiting  : It  is  hiring  employees  through  online  recruiting agencies or the company portal. Hi-tech companies first started this recruiting process, but now it has spread widely among the hospitality segments. One of the most significant advantages of online job posting helps management getting faster responses from the

- c. hiring employees through online recruiting agencies

## 2.2.2 Selecting Employees :

The Executive Housekeeper should consider four principles while selecting the employees for the department:

Explicitness : The selection criteria should be decided earlier for the required position as it should remain constant and should not differ from one candidate to the other.

Objectivity : the interview and hiring process should be measurable with some scoring pattern to determine the selection procedure based on the hotel's selection criteria.

Thoroughness : It should cover four phases: screening, interviewing, skill check and the final meeting with the decision-maker.

The success of the department's operation depends on selecting the correct applicants and placing them in the appropriate positions matching their skills and personalities.

## 2.3 TRAINING SCHEDULE :

One of the major responsibilities of the executive housekeeper is to provide proper training to all the employees working in the department. The training task is generally delegated to the supervisors or assistant executive housekeeper to perform  weekly  or  monthly.  The  goal  of  the  training  is  to  help  employees understand  their  job  better  and  perform  as  per  the  company's  expectations. Training relates to the new employees and is also an ongoing process for the entire team.

## 2.3.1 Benefits of Training :

- · The new employees get to understand and learn the work in a good work environment.
- · The existing employees get to improve their work performance.
- · In cross-training, employees get better exposure in other related departments.
- · The overall productivity of the employees improves.
- · The chances of employee turnover rate reduce.
- · A standardisation at work is achieved.
- · Chances of better business and good customer reviews.

## 2.3.2 Types of Training :

- · Induction or  Orientation Training  : This training is required for new employees to develop the knowledge, skills and attitude needed for the new position.
- · Remedial  Training  : This  training  is  provided  to  all  the  employees working in the department when any change is done in the current working style, or some new standards are introduced.
- · Cross Training : This training is provided for employees to work in other departments to get better exposure to the work procedure of other areas in the hotel.
- · On-the-job Training : This is an ongoing training process provided to all the employees for a better work understanding and uniformity in the operational standards.

## 2.3.3 Steps of Training :

<!-- image -->

## 2.3.3.1 Prepare to Train :

To conduct successful training, the trainer needs to have a logical sequence and  key  detail  of  the  training  program.  Training  should  never  be  planned haphazardly. It should be sequential and as per the staff requirement and for their better understanding. In this stage, the job analysis plays a significant role; the training would be a success when the trainer has a clear idea about the employee's expectations at work. Three components of job analysis are job knowledge, job list and job breakdown.

- · Job Knowledge tells us about what an employee needs to know to perform the everyday task as per the standard set by the company.
- · Job  List tells us about the various tasks that need to be done in that position.
- · Job breakdown is a complete explanation of how the task needs to be performed as per the standard operating procedure.

Analyse the training needs of the staff based on new and existing staff in the department. The three primary areas in which the employees need to be trained are skills, attitude and knowledge.

- · Skill training is the practical and technical aspects of the job, and it helps the employees to under the work standards set by the organisation.
- Example : Bed Making Procedure (an essential skill that a guest room attendant should know)
- · Knowledge  training helps  the  staff  understand  the  organisation,  its system, policies, and the rules that the employees need to follow.

Example : Layout of the entire hotel, Emergency Procedures

## Managing Housekeeping Human  Resource

## House  Keeping Management

These are only possible with a positive attitude that the employee needs to develop and learn to keep up with company expectations.

## 2.3.3.2 Present the Training :

The  trainer  should  include  the  following  components  discussions, demonstrations, audio-visual aids, and exercises for a better understanding of the staff. While teaching the skills, the trainer needs to demonstrate the skill where the job breakdown plays an important role. This part of the training should be conducted at a slower pace for all to understand. They should be encouraged to participate in the activities to develop confidence in doing the task correctly.

## 2.3.3.3 Practice :

Provide ample opportunities for the trainees to practice so that they are all well versed with the steps of performing the task and appreciate the correct performance.

## 2.3.3.4 Follow up :

It is a continuous process of giving feedback, appraising performance, and evaluating the employees' progress.

##  Check Your Progress - 2 :

- 1. Rearrange the training method in the correct order :
- a.  Prepare
- b. Follow-up
- c. Practice
- d.  Present

## 2.4 SCHEDULING :

Housekeeping is a labour intensive department where staff scheduling is based on the occupancy level forecasted by the front office and then referring to the staffing guide.

## 2.4.1 The Staffing Guide :

It is a guide that helps the executive housekeeper determine the total labour hours, staff requirements, and labour costs.

## Developing a Staffing Guide for Room Attendants

To determine the total labour hours for positions that must be scheduled when the hotel is at specific occupancy levels. It can be calculated by using productivity standards.

Assume that the productivity standard for guestroom attendants (GRAs) is 30 minutes (0.5 hour) to clean one guestroom. Using this productivity standard, we can calculate the requirement of room attendants based on the occupancy forecast.

Step 1 : Determine the labour hours to be scheduled at various occupancy levels of a 500-room hotel with 90% occupancy.

Rooms to clean next day

- = 500 X 0.9 = 450 rooms

Labour hours to clean 450 rooms

- = 450 X 0.5 = 225 hours

Step 2 : Now determine the number of GRAs who must be scheduled to work when the hotel is at specific occupancy levels.

At 90% Occupancy,

Rooms to clean next day

= 500 X 0.9 = 450

No. of full-time GRAs needed

= 450/16 = 28.12

= 28 (rounded off)

Step 3 : Labour expense is calculated for room attendants by multiplying the labour hours by the average hourly rate for a room attendant. Assuming the average hourly rate for room attendants is Rs. 10, then for 90% occupancy, it would be:

Labour hours of GRAs

= 225 hours

Labor expense for GRAs per day

= 225 X Rs 10

= Rs 2,250

## 2.4.2 Developing Employee Work Schedules :

The following are essential tips for developing employee work schedules :

- · A schedule should cover a whole workweek for all seven days.
- · Generally, the schedule should be intimated to the department employees three days prior.
- · Weekly off for all employees should be marked on the duty roster.
- · The  daily  attendance  and  area  allocation  is  based  on  the  duty  roster prepared for the week.

Other scheduling concerns are :

Part-time Employees : Provides employer with extra scheduling flexibility; it sometimes reduces labour costs because the benefits and overtime costs usually decrease.

Flexible Work Hour : It allows the employee with varying times to begin and end their workday. The executive housekeeper keeps a check on the general timing of the employee is covered. The benefit of this kind of scheduling is it keeps the staff morale high with better job satisfaction.

Compressed Work Schedule : It offers the employees the opportunity to work the equivalent of a standard workweek in fewer than the usual six days.

Job Sharing : The efforts of two or more part-time employees to fulfil the duties and duties of one full-time employee.

##  Check Your Progress - 3 :

State whether true or false :

- 1. Flexible  work  hours  give  employees  a  fixed  time  schedule  for  work
- 2. Part time employees can employ work with extra scheduling flexibility

## 2.5 MOTIVATION  :

It is a process where employee interest in the job, project or subject is kept engaged.  If  an  employee  gives  a  positive  contribution  to  the  success  of  an operation and gets recognition, praise for the effort given, he would more likely be motivated.

## Managing Housekeeping Human  Resource

## House  Keeping Management

## Methods of Motivating Employees :

Employees can be motivated in many ways starting from cash rewards or delegating added responsibilities to make the staff feel important.

Financial Incentives : It is a monetary benefit that a company gives to employees such as bonuses, equal distribution of service charges to keep the employees motivated.

Recognition : Identify the employee for a job well done; for example, "Best Employee of the Month/Year" can boost employee morale tremendously. It also develops a healthy competition among employees to keep up the excellent performance.

Communication : Allow an open communication channel in an organisation that builds a better awareness among the employees about the happenings in the department,  like  a  department  notice  board  that  conveys  the  messages  and information.

Training and Cross-Training : It improves the employees' productivity and helps them in constant learning and development. Cross-training allows employees to be more flexible; hence it helps them grow within the organisation.

## 2.6 PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL :

- · Helps  in  evaluating  an  employee's  performance  with  formal  written feedback.
- · Providing feedback
- · Analyse strengths and weaknesses and then suggest corrective improvement plans.
- · It is an ongoing process, whereas a formal appraisal is generally conducted periodically based on company procedure.

An  effective  appraisal  process  focuses  on  the  performance  level  and suggests  ways  to  improve  skill  and  performance  level.  The  entire  appraisal session should be positive for the employees, and the employees should have a clear understanding of what they are doing well and which areas they can be better.

There are different ways in which the appraisal can be conducted; every organisation needs to tailor its appraisal program to meet the company goals.

## Hiring Headaches in Housekeeping

Tim MacFarlane has been general manager for six weeks at the Executive Inn, a 200-room downtown property. While he's still learning about the property and its personnel, one department stands out in need of immediate attention: housekeeping. Rooms are not getting cleaned on time, shifts are running shortstaffed, and the department is paying a lot of overtime to employees who stay late to catch up. This morning Mr MacFarlane has called Helen Redman, the executive housekeeper, to his office for a meeting.

Helen has been the executive housekeeper at the hotel for 17 years. She has been plagued constantly by staffing shortages during those years. Not enough people want to work as room attendants, it seems. When she meets with Mr MacFarlane, she tries to explain to him that constantly losing people and hiring and training new employees is a fact of life in the housekeeping department. "It's hard to find people willing to work full time. Jesse will back me up on that."

"Let's have him join us," Mr MacFarlane says and has his secretary page Jesse.

Jesse Rodriguez, the hotel's human resources director, has been almost as long as Helen. He tells Mr Mac Farlane that Helen is right; housekeeping is a hard department to staff. "You should see my advertising budget; I run an ad in newspaper every week! No one applies. Every hotel in town is looking for room attendants."

"I may be new, but I know we have got to have good people to be the best we can be," Mr MacFarlane replies. "I challenge you both to be creative. In a city of almost a million people, there must be enough good people out there to staff our housekeeping department. I am willing to do what I can to help. What kind of support do you need from me?"

## Questions :

- 1. How can Helen and Jesse be creative about recruiting top-notch people for the housekeeping department ?
- 2. What kind of support should Helen and Jesse ask the general manager to provide ?

## House  Keeping Management

## 3.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Hospitality Industry is opting for more contract services and outsourcing to get more cost-effective housekeeping operations. Outsourcing is a business decision made by the department head to get the internal work done by an external service provider. In this, a contract is being signed between the two parties negotiating a proper business deal.

## 3.2 WHEN  TO  CONSIDER  OUTSOURCED  SERVICES  :

To choose between the outsourced and inhouse services, the following needs to be considered:

- · The cost
- · The quality of work by the service provider
- · To increase the productivity

The management needs to compare the initial investment for an in-house set-up, the operational cost for the service with the cost of outsourcing the service.

Few questions that manager needs to ask before outsourcing the services

are :

- · What are the costs involved ?
- · Is there a constrain in time, expertise, and resource ?
- · Is the activity part of the core service ?
- · Would outsourcing the service bring in more credibility ?

## 3.3 CONTRACT  SERVICES  IN  THE  HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT  :

Hotels might choose the following types of contract services :

- · Cleaning process- Public area cleaning, special cleaning, carpet, or floor cleaning.
- · Hiring of Linen
- · Outsourcing of Laundry Services
- · Equipment Outsourcing
- · Pest Control Services
- · Floral Arrangements
- · Horticulture and Landscaping
- · Eco-friendly Garbage Disposal

## 3.4 HIRING CONTRACT PROVIDERS :

Following  are  the  steps  management  should  follow  for  outsourcing  a definite service :

- · Check tender from at least three contractors, compare their quoted rates.
- · Review their market credibility and consider references.
- · Visit the agent's office (a local office is preferable), check for the license and proper government registration documents.
- · Check on the training provided to the staff.
- · Check on the level of supervision provided by the agent at the worksite.

Prepare a detailed specification about the contract mentioning the exact number  of  work  hours,  operational  areas  and  responsibilities,  frequency  of services and process of doing the work, schedule, and any special project. After handing services to a contract agent, it should be monitored regularly to check on the standards. A routine follow-up and meetings with the contractor will help the housekeeper to identify and discuss any problem. The task and completion time should be clearly stated in the contract, and the invoices received should also be checked for accuracy.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

## Identify the Errors and Correct them :

While hiring contract providers the following need to be considered :

- 1. Check with one vendor and finalize the contract.
- 2. Check with the vendor for proper licensing only.

## 3.5 CONTRACT  SPECIFICATION  :

The contract specification should have the following :

- · The duration of the contract service, date of signing and provision to regular review of the specification.
- · Areas that need to be serviced and the frequency of the job to perform.
- · A clear description of the method, equipment, and material required to perform the task as per the hotel's quality standard needs to be given.
- · A proper storage area for their equipment and other materials.

- · List of security requirements for the contract agent.
- · The expected time limit for the job covering the leaves/holidays.
- · Remuneration  and  termination  process  with  the  terms  and  conditions mentioned in the contract.

## 3.6 ADVANTAGES  AND  DISADVANTAGES  OF  CONTRACT SERVICES  :

There are many pros and cons for outsourcing services; hence, before finalising, it requires a lot of groundwork.

##  Advantages :

- · There is no capital investment needed for equipment or sometimes space.
- · Alleviate the necessity of buying or hiring specialised equipment
- · Training and supervision of staff is passed on to the contractors
- · Good contract firms provide skilled labour.

## Management

- · Contractors are accountable for the results.
- · Accurate budgeting can be done.
- · Service providers are aware of the job, latest equipment, and technology.
- · The organisation faces no union problem.

##  Disadvantages :

- · It weakens the authority of the management over the quality and loyalty of the staff.
- · The staff of the contract agent is not the staff of the hotel and may not have the skills of doing guest interactions.
- · Sometimes the contractor might use lower quality supplies which might lower the hotel standards.
- · Other ancillary issues might come up from time to time, like disciplinary or security issues.
- · Poor supervision may lead to a fall in service standards.

##  Check Your Progress - 2 :

Tick the odd one out :

- 1. Advantages of contract services:
- o  Good contract firms provide skilled labour.
- o  Contractors are accountable for the results.
- o  Use of lower quality of supplies by contractor.
- o    Budgeting  is  more  precise.

## 3.7 PRICING OF CONTRACTS :

The payment process for outsourced services may include one of the following :

- · Management Fee Consultancy  Basis  : The customer provides labour, equipment, materials etc., and the contractor provides the management expertise.
- · A Fixed Period Cost : Fixed Period Cost is generally calculated on the total cost or cost per unit of work based on the quality of the work or the frequency of the job that needs to be done. In this method, the service is provided at a specific cost; not much detail is provided on the number of hours or labour required, the equipment and the material needed.
- · Unit  Rate  Agreement  : In  this  method,  the  contractor  measures  the different areas that need to be serviced as informed by the department head, and then the cost is calculated:

Man-hours = areas X time X frequency

Example : If the pest control provider needs to service all four different areas of the hotel for four hours and all seven days a week, then man-hours will be calculated as :

Man-hours

= 4 X 4 X 7

= 112 hours

Along with the wages, the firm also adds the cost of equipment, supplies, overheads, and profit and then the final quote is priced.

## ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING

The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## PLANNING DAILY HOUSEKEEPING OPERATIONS

## Block Introduction :

The main feature of the Housekeeping Department is that of making the hotel a home away from home, and one of the daily tasks of the housekeeping is  trying  to  attain  the  required atmosphere with personalised service.

The  detail  of  different  types  of  cleaning  equipment  and  agents  used  in various  areas  of  the  hotel.  It  is  imperative  to  use  the  correct  equipment  and cleaning agent to achieve the cleaning and hygiene standards and avoid damage to the surface area being cleaned. The care and maintenance of equipment is also stressed in this unit, as it is an essential factor contributing to the department's optimum performance.

The primary purpose of the regular daily routine of cleaning and inspection is  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  any  complaints  about  the  accommodation.  First impressions are lasting ones, and a clean and tidy room will give a good impact that  will  lead  to  returned  visits and  more  business.

The successive units brief us regarding the cleaning process of the rooms. There are specific guidelines regarding the cleaning of rooms, whether occupied or  unoccupied.  We  need  to  know  the  general  guidelines  about  these  cleaning processes. We are going to learn how to clean the room. It may seem relatively easy or less important, but if you see it practically, it gives us an idea about its technical importance. Thus, we find that room cleaning procedure is of utmost importance  as  it  is  carried  out  daily  in  occupied  or  unoccupied  rooms.  The cleaning is to be ensured with the checklist, which the room attendant must see and upgrade accordingly.

## 1.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we will discuss different types of housekeeping cleaning equipment and agents used on various surfaces in different areas of the hotel.

## House Keeping Management

## After going through this portion, students would be able to understand :

- · In stating the criteria for purchasing cleaning equipment and agents.
- · Identify the categories of cleaning agent and equipment
- · Understand how to use the equipment.
- · List the usage of the cleaning agents on different types of surfaces.
- · Discuss the methods of cleaning and maintaining different surfaces

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION  :

To process better cleaning and maintenance in the hotels, the housekeeping department is dependent on high-quality cleaning equipment and cleaning agents. The housekeeping employees should be well trained and aware of the correct usage of the equipment and cleaning chemicals.

It is the responsibility of the Executive Housekeeper to select the appropriate type of equipment for the work efficiency of the employee and train them on the types of surfaces and their maintenance.

Hotels should train employees on the handling of equipment to better understand the work and its maintenance. Staff should assess the surface type first and then decide the cleaning process.

## 1.2 CLEANING EQUIPMENT :

## 1.2.1 Choosing the Equipment :

The Executive Housekeeper must choose the correct equipment for the job, and it should be compatible for all to work with and get the job done on time.

One should consider the following points :

- · Ease of operation and maintenance
- · Cost of the equipment (initial and operating)
- · Save time and labour
- · Multiple usages
- · Appropriate design and size depending on the task
- · Portable and easy to store.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

- 1. List the missing point to consider in choosing the correct equipment for the job.
- a. Multiple usage for the equipment
- b. The initial and operational cost of the machine
- c. User friendly equipment
- d.

## 1.3 TYPES OF CLEANING EQUIPMENT :

Equipment can be of two categories :

- · Manual Equipment
- · Mechanical Equipment

Fig. 2 : Hard Brush

<!-- image -->

## 1.3.1 Manual Equipment :

Brushes : It is used to remove dry or wet dust from all kinds of surfaces. It consists of different parts :

<!-- image -->

Generally, there are three main types of brush - hard brush, soft brush and scrubbing brush. Each has its specifications based on their usage, like hard brushes usually have stiff and spaced out bristles used for heavy soiling on hard surfaces, whereas the soft brushes are flexible and have close-set bristles to remove loose soil.

Scrubbing brushes have short coarse bristles designed to be used on hard surfaces for tough stain removal. Long handle brushes are called T-brush as they are useful in scrubbing and cleaning more extensive areas.

For the care and cleaning of these pieces of equipment, we should generally tap the brush on a hard surface to remove the loose dust and frequently wash it with water or warm, mildly soapy water. Rinse it properly, shake off the excess water from the bristles, and hang it upside down for proper drying. Never leave brushes resting on their bristles as they may flay out if left resting on their stock, and even water may rotten the bristles over time. The best way to store them is to hang the brushes bristles downward.

Brooms should be shaken free from dust after using and never be left standing on the bristles as they tend to lose shape and not clean properly. One should not use brooms on wet surfaces. Stiff brooms made of coconut fibres can be used on wet surfaces but later needs to be dried thoroughly.

Mops : These are available in two varieties, one for wet surfaces and the other for dry surfaces. The ones used on the dry surface are designed to remove soil and debris from floors, walls, and ceilings without dissipating the dust. These mops consist of cotton, acrylic, nylon, or polyester stretched on a metal frame to be removed and washed. Wet mop heads are made up of cotton, sponge or other fibres that absorb water. These mops are used along with buckets to get the area cleaned.

For Regular maintenance of the mop, it should be washed in warm water and dried properly to get an effective cleaning result.

Dusters : Various types of clothes are used for cleaning purposes in different areas of the hotel by the housekeeping staff. Generally, the dusters are colour-coded for effective and correct use in specific areas, and even the staff should be well trained. Swabs and wipes are all-purpose cloths. They are made of soft, absorbent material used for wet cleaning and damp dusting. Scrims are loosely woven material preferred because of their high absorbency and lint-free characteristics. Dust  sheets are  made  of  any  thin  cotton  material,  generally discarded bed sheets or curtains. These are used to cover furniture and other articles during thorough cleaning or major maintenance work.

Carts and Trolleys : These are useful to carry a large number of supplies, items, or linen from one area to another, and it also saves the running around time, making it convenient for the staff to work

Fig. 9 : Housekeeping Trolley

<!-- image -->

The housekeeping trolley comprises many shelves and compartments to store in guestroom supplies, linen, and small equipment, which needs to be carried by room attendants to service the guestrooms effectively. The cart should be well organised for each shift so that the guestroom attendant does not waste time making frequent trips to the housekeeping pantry. Two sacks are attached on both sides of the trolley, one for the garbage and the other used for soiled linen. While setting the linen in the trolley, place heavier ones on the lower shelf and the lighter ones on the top shelf.

Linen Trolley : These trolleys are used in the housekeeping department for transferring linen from laundry to linen room or from linen room to floor pantries for restocking. These trollies are made up of steel or aluminium with canvas make linen bags.

Mop Wringer Trolley : This equipment consists of one or two buckets along with a mop and an attached wringer, all mounted on a trolley with caster wheels.

Other Equipment : This includes other pieces used in the housekeeping department for better work performance. A hand caddy is a carry box made of plastic or cane with a handle and separate compartments. These are used by the room attendants to carry cleaning supplies and small manual equipment for guestroom cleaning, and it needs to be restocked before the new shift. Spray bottles are  lightweight  containers  with  a  fine  spray  nozzle  used  for  spray cleaning. Dustpans are used to collect debris and dust, and they come in different sizes. Dustpan with long attachment helps in the elimination of bending while collecting the debris. It should be suspended on a hook or placed horizontally when not in use.

## Fill in the blanks :

- 1. is a carry box made of plastic or cane with a handle and compartments. These are used by to carry cleaning supplies and small equipment for guestroom cleaning.

## 1.3.2 Electrical Equipment :

Electrical equipment is generally powered by electricity; hence staff needs to  know  how  to  operate  the  equipment  since  incorrect  usage  may  lead  to inefficient cleaning and be a safety hazard.

Vacuum Cleaners : Removes dust and other loose particles from hard or soft  surfaces  by  suction,  and  some,  in  addition,  have  brushes  to  aid  dust collection. The dust is collected in a container enclosed within the body of the machine (cylindrical or canister models) or on the outside in the form of a bag (upright models). When the cylindrical and canisters models are in use, the hose through which the suction takes place is always attached. The different heads are easily changed, making vacuum cleaners more adaptable than the upright models, suited to large, carpeted areas. To reduce the noise of vacuum cleaners, they are fitted with a filter/diffuser.

Small suction cleaners are available for upholstery and carpet edges etc., and are easily carried by hand, e.g. dustette or strapped to the operator's back. Large canister-type suction cleaners may be adapted to collect dust or water and are referred to as wet/dry pickups.

15 : Vacuum Cleaner Fig:

<!-- image -->

Care and Storage : Vacuum cleaners will have a long life and better efficiency if maintained well. The staff need to be trained about the maintenance of vacuum cleaner for better efficiency. The wheels of the machine need to be oiled periodically. After use, the dust bags should be checked and emptied. All the attachments need to be cleaned regularly; a wet vacuum cleaner needs to be emptied, washed, and then wiped after every usage. The hosepipe needs to be hung on hooks, and other attachments should be placed on a shelf for drying.

Wet Extractor : Machines that restore the surface appearance by removing the deeply embedded soiling that cannot be removed easily by suction cleaning processes like carpets, upholstery, and curtains.

Carpet Shampooing Machine : The machine is designed for the deep cleaning process of carpets. These machines have a rotary brush in conjunction with  a  range  of  accessories  and  attachments  like  a  tank  for  hot  water  and recommended shampoo used for carpet shampooing. The hot water and detergent are shot into the carpet with high-pressure nozzles, the dirt is flushed to the surface, and the dirty water is removed by suction. Certain hotels outsource these services.

## House Keeping Management

Floor Scrubber and Polisher : Used for scrubbing, buffing, burnishing, scarifying and spray maintenance. Multipurpose scrubbing/polishing machines are used in many establishments for multitasking from the same machine unit. In  some  circumstances,  coloured  abrasive  nylon  pads  replace  the  scrubbing brushes. For regular speed machines:

- · Green pads are used for scrubbing the floor
- · Red pads are used for buffing and cleaning the floor
- · White pads are used for polishing the floor surface.

## 1.3.3 Care of Equipment :

Having selected and bought good equipment, it is up to the Housekeeper to see that it is properly looked after. This requires training and supervision of the staff.

##  Care of Mechanical Equipment :

- · Regular servicing of the equipment is necessary.
- · Check for frayed wires and plugs.
- · Report unusual working noise from equipment.
- · Oil the wheels/casters for easy movements.
- · Check for tangled/knotted wires.
- · Keep the equipment and the accessories clean after every use.

##  Check Your Progress - 3 :

- 1. is used to remove dust particles from hard surface.
- 2. To reduce the noise while working they are fitted with a

## 1.4 CLEANING AGENT :

## 1.4.1 Water :

It is the simplest cleaning solvent, and some forms of dirt will be dissolved by it. But unless it is mixed with a cleaning agent, such as a detergent, it is ineffective. It does not even wet a surface satisfactorily as its surface tension prevents it from spreading. Hardness in water is another consideration to be borne in mind because hardness in water adversely affects the efficacy of some cleaning agents, e.g., soap and soap-based washing powders. It can cause premature ageing of fabrics, can cause scale and fur to be deposited in boilers, pipes, and domestic appliances. The addition of soda may soften hard water.

## 1.4.2 Detergent :

When used in conjunction with water, these can loosen and remove dirt. Detergents are available in packets and bottles, each one differing only in the mixture of chemical substances. The primary ingredient of any detergent is a surfactant. A surfactant is a wetting agent that lowers the surface tension of water, emulsifies the grease, and suspends soiling to varying degrees. An important consideration in choosing surfactants for a detergent base is that they should be biodegradable.

Ideally, a detergent should,

- · Have good wetting power so that the solution penetrates between the article and the dirt particles
- · Good emulsifying power to break up the grease and enable the soiling to be loosened
- · Good suspending power to prevent redeposition of the soiling
- · Be effective in all types of water
- · Be effective over a wide range of temperatures. Be harmless to the article and skin.
- · Be easy to be rinsed away
- · Be biodegradable

## 1.4.3 Toilet Cleaner :

They are crystalline, powdered or liquid, and they rely on their acid content to clean and keep the W.C pan hygienic. It again may be of two types, powder, and liquid type. Powdered toilet cleansers consist of a soluble acidic powder, chlorinated bleach, finely ground abrasive to help when a brush is used, and a bubble giving substance that helps spread the active ingredient throughout the water. Liquid toilet cleaner maybe a diluted solution of hydrochloric acid and should be used with great care because the concentration may cause damage to the surface of the pan to surrounding areas and to the person using it if the liquid is spilt. All these toilet cleaners are designed for cleaning and disinfecting of the lavatories and urinals only and should never in any circumstances be mixed with other cleansers because harmful gases are likely to be produced.

## 1.4.4 Window Cleaner :

It consists of water-miscible solvent to which a small quantity of surfactant and possibly an alkali are added to improve the polishing effect of the cleanser. Some also contain fine abrasives. The cleaner is applied with a cleaning rag and rubbed off with a clean, soft cloth. Water or water to which some methylated spirit or vinegar has been added does the job quite well and much more cheaply but entails more rubbing.

## 1.4.5 Reagent :

The cleaning action is carried out with the help of a chemical reaction.

Acid : Metal stains are removed with acid. Acids like Vinegar and lemon are used to remove tarnish of copper and brass and mild water stains on bathtubs, washbasins, etc. Oxalic acid or hydrochloric acid is more effective for resistant water stains, which are hard to remove. The handling of these acids should be carried out under supervision to avoid misuse and for safety.

Alkali : Caustic soda and ammonia are the best alkalis used as grease emulsifiers and stain removal agents. For cleaning blocked drains and large industrial equipment, caustic soda is the potent alkaline cleaning agent. They are available in flakes or liquid form. Close attention should be given while handling these potent agents, as they have high ph-value.

Absorbents : They absorb the stains from the material and play an essential role as a cleaning agent. The vital cleaning action is to absorb the stain or grease, e.g. starch, French chalk powders, and besan or gram flour. Their constituents vary, and many are of vegetable origin. Unlike abrasives, they are not manufactured.

Paraffin oil (highly refined mineral oil (Wax) or liquid hydrocarbon mixture used as solvent) is also efficient for cleaning baths, but it is seldom used

due to smell. Organic solvents, usually methylated spirit, white spirit (turpentine substitute), and carbon tetrachloride, are grease solvents used to remove grease and wax from different surfaces. The formers are highly flammable, while carbon tetrachloride is harmful if inhaled and should never be used in a confined space. Aerosol dry cleaners are suitable for use on wallpapers.

## 1.4.6 Polishes :

They do not necessarily clean but produce a shine by providing a smooth surface from which light is reflected evenly. They do this by smoothing out any unevenness on the surface of the articles.

These fall into three types liquid, paste and cream . These fall into three broad categories - spirit base, oil base and water base. Spirit-based products are used primarily for mirrors, windowpanes, etc. Oil-based products are used on wood, linoleum and synthetic floorings, leather, tiles, etc. Water-based products are used on sealed floors, rubber, and thermoplastic floors.

Polishes may be used after dirt and dust have been removed from surfaces and in small quantities. Ensure that the correct type of polish is used with the proper method of polishing.

##  Criteria for a Good Polish :

- a. It should be non-greasy.
- b. It should give a good shine easily.
- c. It should provide a hard, dry finish to ensure protection and ease of cleaning.
- d. It should not mark easily.
- e. It should reduce the cost of cleaning and maintenance.
- f. It should not smell unpleasant.

## 1.4.7 Bathroom and All-Purpose Cleaner :

There are several bathroom and all-purpose cleaners in the market today. Bathroom chemical cleaners should never be combined and used together. For example, when ammonia and chlorine are mixed, deadly gases are produced. Employees should be trained on the use of toilet cleaners. All-purpose cleaners can be used to wash walls, scrub floors, clean tubs and showers and wash windows and mirrors. They are concentrated and can be diluted with water to meet different cleaning needs.

## 1.4.8 Disinfectant and Air Freshener :

Disinfectants, antiseptics and deodorants are not strictly cleaning agents but are often used during cleaning organisations. Housekeepers should control the use of disinfectants and antiseptics as many have strong smells, and their use often  suggests  illness  or  foul  drains.  Disinfectants  kill  bacteria;  antiseptics prevent bacterial growth; deodorants mask the unpleasant odour by combining chemically with the particles forming the odour. With the help of these cleaning agents, a housekeeping Department plans out its cleaning program.

## 1.5 CARE AND  CLEANING  OF  DIFFERENT  SURFACES  :

## 1.5.1 Metal :

Metals are used in many areas of a hotel like indoor and window fittings, furniture, wall panels, light fittings, sanitaryware, cooking utensils, guestroom accessories, bathroom fixtures etc. The most used metals are silver, steel, copper, brass, bronze, aluminium, and iron. Most of the metal surfaces get tarnished, scratched, or rusted unless treated or protected correctly from time to time. To protect metal surfaces, they are treated with one of the following :

- · paint (applied on iron or steel to give a decorative look but mainly to protect from moisture)
- · electroplating (it  is  done  using  the  process  of  electrolysis  in  which decorative metals like gold, silver, zinc is deposited on brass, steel or copper to give a durable finish), galvanising (usually steel or iron is coated with a layer of zinc to avoid corrosion)
- · enamelling (molten glass is applied to a metal surface, which gives it a transparent and smooth surface that can be easily cleaned)
- · lacquering (shellac dissolved in alcohol and then coated over brass or copper to reduce tarnishing)

Commonly used metals are Silver, Steel, Brass, Bronze, and Iron. Every metal has a different process for cleaning and maintaining.

Silver is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with a shine if adequately maintained. Silver requires cleaning and polishing regularly. The silver article needs to be washed in a hot detergent solution in an enamelled tray. After that, it should be wiped and buffed till a good shine is achieved.

Steel is an alloy of iron. It is used in the form of pressed chrome steel for bathroom fixtures. It is also used in making cutlery, utensils. Steel coated with chromium is called chrome steel, generally used for bathroom fittings; watermarks are easy to remove and do not tarnish. Stainless steel has some percentage of chromium to make the steel corrosion resistant. In some cases, steel is coated with zinc to prevent tarnishing. Steel can be washed in a hot detergent or chemical solution for better effect but must be dried off immediately with a lint-free wiping cloth.

Brass is a golden-brown alloy of copper and zinc. It is used for staircase railing, ashtrays, taps and other areas. Brass tends to tarnish quickly; hence it needs to be lacquered. For cleaning, wipe off the dust from the article, apply the brass cleaning chemical, leave it for some time and then buff it continuously to get the shine back.

## House Keeping Management

## 1.5.2 Glass :

It is a transparent, brittle, and lustrous material made up of silica or sand. A mixture of pure, fine sand, soda or potash and other ingredients are carefully measured; this combination is called a batch. The batch is then passed through a heated furnace at a high temperature. It fuses into molten glass, followed by a cooling process called annealing. Glass makes doors, windows, furniture, décor pieces, lighting fixtures, and many other areas. Even slight smudge marks are prominent on glass surfaces; hence it requires frequent cleaning. Dusting should be done with a lint-free cloth. Generally, a glass surface is cleaned with a liquid chemical or simply with water.

## 1.5.3 Wood :

It is hard, compact, fibrous, and porous. Wood is a versatile surface material with varied colours and patterns. Wood absorbs water and dust because of its porous nature. It also tends to get fungal growths. Because of this nature of woods, it requires extra protection. Generally, a wooden surface is applied wax polish and rubbed well to get a good shine. Lacquer varnish all serve the same purpose to protect the wooden surface from any kind of damage.

## 1.5.4 Stone :

A variety of natural stones are used as hard surfaces in different areas of the hotel. They are mainly used for floor finishes, tabletops, wall surfaces, vanity counters and decorative artefacts. Stone surfaces are cleaned using hot water, detergents, or cleaning chemicals.

## 1.5.5 Leather :

It is expensive material; hence it should be kept supple to prevent cracking. Leather tends to attract oil and grease quickly, creating smudge marks. It needs regular dusting or suction cleaning. Occasionally it can be polished with creambased furniture polish to keep it soft.

## 1.5.6 Rubber :

Natural rubber is obtained from a milky white fluid called latex acquired from plants, then the crude rubber is treated with compounding ingredients in several mixing machines. Later this mixture is applied to a base and given a shape by placing in a mould and vulcanised. Rubber can be cleaned with a neutral detergent solution or cream polish to provide a shiny texture.

## 2.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we have discussed the importance of a guestroom, different types of rooms in a hotel, guest supplies and their classification.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Discuss the importance of a guestroom to a guest
- · Know the different types of guestrooms in a hotel
- · Identify the categories of guest supplies.
- · Detail out the importance and use of par stock.

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION  :

The guestroom is one of the prime products of a hotel, generating a good amount of profit percentage from room sales. A room sold on a day earns revenue for that day, and then it can be made ready again the next day to sell to some other guest. Hence rooms are considered highly perishable commodities as rooms not sold for a day lose revenue.

There might be many reasons for a guest to stay in a hotel, but they always expect a certain service and comfort.

## 2.2 IMPORTANCE  OF A  GUESTROOM  TO  A  GUEST  :

Fig. 1 : Hotel Guestroom

<!-- image -->

A guest room is a place where a guest spends some leisure time without any anxiety and tension. A guestroom is a highly perishable commodity, and fifty per cent of the property profit comes from room sales. Guests stay in the hotel for pleasure, convenience, comfort, and necessity. Hence, it is the responsibility of the housekeeping staff to take utmost care of the guestroom and make the guest feel comfortable and relaxed as he feels at home. It is essential to understand the guest's expectations and provide the best of services and in-room facilities and a good standard of cleanliness and hygiene in the guestrooms.

In a guestroom, the guest is provided with all modern amenities like air conditioners,  television,  internet  facility,  refrigerator,  mini-bar,  geyser,  and bathtub, contributing to necessities in today's world. Apart from the food and shelter, various other services like room service, second service, turn down service, valet service etc., are also provided to the guest so that he feels delighted and wishes to return to the property again and give repeated business. Guest privacy, safety and security are the topmost priority of the hotel.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

Fill in the missing answers :

- 1.
- A  guestroom  is  a  highly commodity..
- 2. Along with safety and security, is also a top priority for the hotel.

## 2.3 TYPES OF GUESTROOMS :

The  hotel  guest  room  comes  in  many  sizes  and  shapes.  Hotels  offer different product types in terms of service level and target market. Standards vary in terms of look, composition, room category, and hotel classification. Location types for planning the room's construction can affect the look of a guest room as well. Over the period, detailed analysis of hotel guests' needs and wants has shaped guest rooms. Today, the modern guest room is created to meet a guest's room preferences. Room preferences are defined as the individual guest's choice of room type, personal liking, and sometimes the availability of rooms.

## 3.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we have discussed the procedure of cleaning a guestroom and the preparation that the housekeeping department requires.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Identify the procedures the room attendants follow when reporting to work.
- · Describe  the  procedure  that  is  followed  by  the  room  attendant  when cleaning the guestrooms.
- · Distinguish between the types of guestroom cleaning.
- · Identify the procedures for turndown service.

## 3.1 INTRODUCTION  :

The cleaning process in a guestroom is carried out for many reasons :

- · to give an aesthetical appeal
- · to provide a regular maintenance
- · safety against health hazards

The cleaning process involves using various cleaning agents and proper cleaning methods based on the surface to be cleaned. Housekeeping plays a vital role in ensuring that guestrooms meet the standards that guests need and expect. By maintaining the standards, it ensures repeat clientele and satisfied guests. A systematic approach to cleaning will help the room attendants save time and energy. The sequence of cleaning a guestroom consists of preparatory steps, actual cleaning tasks and a final check. The inspection procedure is an integral part of guestroom cleaning.

## 3.2 FREQUENCY OF CLEANING :

The cleaning process can be segregated based on the frequency, which depends on the level of soiling, type of surface, usage degree, and following the set cleaning standards.

Employees need to be trained with the set procedures and frequencies for carrying out the daily tasks. Sometimes a schedule is made and displayed on the notice board near the housekeeping control desk or floor pantry area.

Daily Tasks/Routine Cleaning : These are routine tasks carried out on a day to day basis by the staff of the housekeeping department to maintain the guestroom's fresh and spotless appearance. These include the regular servicing of guestrooms, cleaning bathrooms and toilets, suction cleaning of floors and floor coverings.

Weekly Cleaning : Certain areas cannot be cleaned every day because of the busy schedule of the room attendants. Hence, a weekly schedule is planned so that all intricate areas can be attended once weekly, like high-level dusting (hard to reach areas) or under the bed vacuuming, descaling of coffee kettle, etc.

Periodic Cleaning : These cleaning tasks are pre-planned and carried out monthly, yearly, or bi-yearly. Examples of such cleaning are carpet shampooing, chandelier cleaning or hard floor polishing.

Deep Cleaning : It is a combined process of cleaning and doing preventive maintenance. This permits the hotel personnel to spend longer time in the area to get the job done thoroughly and not hurry to complete the task. The cleaning process involves replacing or repairing worn-out or damaged items from top to bottom and sanitising the area to a much higher degree than daily housekeeping maintenance.  Doing  this  will  increase  the  life  span  of  the  soft  furnishing, furniture, and fixtures significantly.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

Identify the type of cleaning :

- 1. Pre-planned cleaning and carried out on monthly basis :
- 2. Cleaning and preventive maintenance done together :
- 3. Area cleaning that are attended once in a week :

## 3.3 THE  CLEANING  PROCESS  OF  A  GUESTROOM  :

The  housekeeping  room  attendant  must  follow  a  system  to  produce spotlessly clean guestrooms consistently. Systematic planning would save time and help the housekeeping personnel in overlooking a cleaning task.

## Cleaning of Guest Rooms

## House Keeping Management

## 3.3.1 Preparation to Clean :

The  first  step  of  planning  is  to  set  the  cleaning  supplies,  equipment, guestroom  linen,  and  amenities  necessary  for  cleaning  and  setting  up  the guestrooms. The housekeeping trolley is a giant toolbox set with all the essential things needed to do an effective job. A well-organised and stocked cart is the key to efficiency, and it helps the room attendant avoid many trips to the floor pantry or linen room. The trolleys are stocked with guestroom supplies and fresh linen, along with garbage and soiled linen bags on both sides. All cleaning supplies for the guestroom and bathroom are kept in a hand caddy, and the room attendants carry them along while cleaning a room.

## 3.3.2 Room Assignment :

After assembling and setting up the work tools, staff are ready to begin their work. Before guestrooms cleaning begins, they should prioritise work as per the room status. The room status report provides information on the occupancy or condition of the property's room daily, and it is two-way communication between  the  housekeeping  and  front  office  department.  There  are  several categories of room status, but the room attendant's cleaning schedule will be determined in the following sequence:

Check-out : A room from which the guest has already checked out

Stay-over : A room in which the guest is expected to stay again

Due out : A room from which a guest is scheduled to check out later that day

The Room Status report is printed from the property management system software. After that, the rooms are assigned to the room attendant based on work standards for specific types of rooms and cleaning tasks decided by the property. The room attendant uses this report to prioritise the workday and proceed with the work accordingly. Checkouts are attended first as these are always in high demand for the front office to resell them to the arriving guest. The exception to this would be if a room is occupied by a VIP or a room having 'clean my room' request, then staff should attend them before checkout rooms. Such may be the operating procedure in some hotels. Secondly, the stayover room needs to be cleaned as these are the guests staying in the hotel (except the 'do not disturb' rooms). These rooms have the sign of DND or double lock, which is a clear indication for the room attendants that the guest does not need service now. The attendant should confirm later as to when the guest wants the room to be made. Expected checkouts or due outs are the last rooms that the room attendants attend. If a guest refuses service, the floor supervisor should call to arrange a convenient time for cleaning.

## 3.3.3 Entering the Guestroom :

The room attendant already knows the status of the allotted rooms based on the individual's area allocation. The housekeeping personnel then approaches the guest room as per the status report, knocks at the door firmly with the knuckle or ring the bell clearly announcing the department. When there is no answer, repeat the knock after 10 seconds announcing once more. If there is still no answer, open the door with the section master key. Push the door again; knock announcing inside the room "Housekeeping." If still there is no reply, and once the room attendant is relatively sure that there is no one in the room, open the door and keep it that way until the entire cleaning cycle is complete.

## 3.3.4 Room Cleaning Procedure :

- · Drawback the draperies and check the cords and hooks for any kind of damage.
- · Open the windows and air the room while you are cleaning.
- · Check the air conditioning/heater and set it according to the standard.

- · Vacuum the carpet and all the floor baseboards.
- · Spot clean the walls if necessary.
- · Replenish all the bedroom supplies.
- · Take a final look around so that nothing is missed out.

## 3.3.5 Bathroom Cleaning Procedure :

- · Apply toilet cleaner to the bowl so that it can sit for some time.
- · Damp dust all the toilet fixtures.
- · Clean and disinfectant the wall phone.
- · Clean the bathtub, surrounding tiles, shower area, vanity counter, and sink with all-purpose cleaner and scrubber.

- · Replace the used towel with fresh ones.
- · Mop the floor with floor disinfectant.

- · Take a critical look around so that nothing is missed out.

To  conclude  work  in  the  guestroom,  tidy  the  guest  possessions  and belongings. Guest valuables should not be touched and take a final look at the room before leaving.

## 3.3.6 Bed Making Procedure :

- · Remove soiled sheets and pillowcases and shake them out individually.
- · Turn out mattress as previously described.

## Cleaning of Guest Rooms

## House Keeping

## Management

- · Shake out the mattress protector and re-lay it on the mattress. Change the protector if soiled or smelling.
- · Open out fresh lower sheet evenly and tuck it securely at the head, foot, and sides. Open out a fresh top sheet and distribute it evenly over the lower bed sheet.
- · Ensure that the laundry crease is in the same line as the inner sheet for even  distribution.  The  sheet  hem  should  be  evenly  pulled  up  to  the headboard and tuck this sheet at the foot.
- · Open out the blanket and distribute it evenly on the top sheet using the crease as described.
- · Ensure that the blanket labels are at the foot. Pull the blanket four inches from the headboard.
- · Fold the top sheet, at the head of the bed, over the blanket and fold the sheet and blanket again.
- · The blanket and top sheet are together tucked uniformly on both sides, while the corners at the foot of the bed are mitred.
- · Cover the pillows with fresh pillow slips. Fluff the pillow and even out pillow slips to look neat. Since pillow slips are larger than the pillow, the excess slip should be neatly folded downward.
- · The side of the pillow which has the fold should be away from the guest view.
- · Cover completed bed with the bedspread, ensuring it is right side up and falling evenly all around the bed.
- · Keep extra bedspread towards the headboard to crease in between the pillows to make the bed look appealing.
- · The bedspread corners should be aesthetically done.
- · Put spare blankets in plastic bags in the uppermost or lowermost shelf in the guest closet.

## 4.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we will discuss the different public areas and the cleaning procedures done by the housekeeping department.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Understand the meaning of the term public areas and list them
- · Describe the procedure of cleaning and maintaining the public areas
- · Distinguish between the types of public areas

## 4.1 INTRODUCTION  :

The public areas in a hotel consist of entrances, lobby, corridors, elevators, restrooms and health facilities and other areas that the guests see include dining areas, banquet and meeting rooms, spa and sometimes the sales office. The front of the house areas conveys a strong statement about the rest of the hotel, and it works as a first impression for the guests.

The cleaning of public areas involves cleaning hard-to-reach areas and may include the use of ladders. While using ladders, the housemen should take all safety precautions. Many hotels get their public areas cleaned by contractors. Like cleaning in other areas of the hotel, the cleaning routine for public areas can be divided into daily, weekly, monthly, and periodic tasks. Daily cleaning tasks include dusting, emptying ashtrays and bins, suction-cleaning upholstery, mopping hard floors, cleaning glass surfaces, arranging flowers and cleaning toilet areas. Weekly tasks include scrubbing floors, dusting walls, dusting and wiping lighting fixtures, cleaning, and polishing hard surfaces and vacuuming carpets. Monthly tasks cover such activities as spray-cleaning and buffing of floors  and  polishing  furniture  and  other  woodwork.  Periodic  tasks  include washing  walls,  stripping  and  re-polishing  or  re-sealing  floors,  shampooing carpets and washing windows.

## 4.2 CLEANING  OF  PUBLIC  AREAS  :

## 4.2.1 Entrances :

Some hotels may have elaborate design features at the entrances, cleaning which may be difficult for the housekeeping department. If not cleaned and maintained daily, entrances can easily acquire a shabby look due to the heavy traffic and exposure, which can be very unappealing for an arriving guest.

The preventive maintenance of floors at the entrance is essential since this is the inlet point for dust and dirt trekked in by all the guests' shoes. If the dirt and grit are not prevented from entering the establishment at this stage, they will eventually become embedded in the floor and deteriorate the surface. So, care must be taken in keeping cleanliness.

##  Cleaning of Flooring, Mats and Doors :

A doormat or runner should be placed just outside the entrance to prevent most dirt and soil from being brought in with the guest's shoes. Another doormat or runner must be placed just inside the entrance to remove any dust remnants from the shoes.

The other cleaning and maintaining tasks for this area is given below.

- · Glass doors should be cleaned twice a day, and where public traffic is high, the frequency of cleaning may have to be even three or four times daily.
- · Plants at the entrances should be watered when required.
- · Doors and door tracks are usually cleaned thoroughly early in the morning.
- · The doormats and runners must be vacuum cleaned daily.
- · In the rainy season and during times of heavy traffic, cleaning the mats twice a day or even more.
- · The floor at the entrance must be mopped frequently throughout the day.
- · Wooden doors should be damp dusted once daily.

Cleaning of Public Areas

## House Keeping Management

- · Brass knobs and handles should be polished weekly.
- · Lights and lighting fixtures should be checked daily and cleaned weekly.

## 4.2.2 Lobbies :

It is the area in the hotel which comes first in contact with the guest. This is the place where guests interact, relax and check-in. Like entrances, these are also heavy-traffic areas. Many lobbies are carpeted, while others have hard flooring. Floors in the lobbies need to be frequently cleaned. Hence cleaning should be scheduled for the night or early morning when there is less traffic. Lobbies may have high ceilings, elaborate chandeliers and other features that are difficult to clean. In many hotels, these features are cleaned and maintained by contractors.

##  The Daily Cleaning of the Lobby :

- · Doors, door handles, and knobs should be damp dusted daily.
- · Carpeted areas should be suction cleaned daily to remove dust and dirt.
- · Any stains on the carpet or upholstery should be removed immediately.
- · Hard floors must be mopped or vacuumed daily.
- · Lights and lighting fixtures should be checked daily and cleaned weekly.
- · Furniture should be damp dusted daily.
- · Telephones must be damp dusted with a disinfectant solution and wiped dry with a dry duster.
- · Ashtrays, sand urns, and wastepaper baskets should be emptied and dampdusted
- · Flower arrangements should be attended to daily, and indoor plants watered as required.
- · Glass surfaces and windows should be cleaned with a proprietary glasscleaner daily.

##  Periodic cleaning of Lobby :

These tasks should be scheduled periodically, once a week, once a month, once in six months, or once in a year.

- · Wooden furniture should be polished once a week.
- · Curtains should be suction-cleaned weekly.
- · Carpets should be shampooed once a month, but in heavy traffic or heavy soiling, the cleaning frequency could be once a week.
- · Ceilings and other hard-to-reach areas such as tops of fans and cornices should be cleaned once a week.
- · Very high ceilings may be dusted once a month.
- · Elaborate  chandeliers  may  be  brought  down  and  cleaned  once  in  six months.

## 4.2.3 Front Desk :

The cleaning should be done at non-peak hours so as not to interrupt the flow of business. When guests approach the front desk during the cleaning process, cleaning should be stopped, and the employee doing the task should step aside. Cleaning tasks should in no way hamper the flow of work at the front desk.

Front desks may be elaborately designed or be simply practical in design. In the latter case, they will be easier to clean. The front desk in most hotels is a part of the entrance lobby.

- · The front desk needs to have a spotless appearance always.
- · Regular vacuuming.
- · Any kind of surface damage should be reported.
- · Not to unplug any equipment at the front desk area.
- · Not to touch any paper or business-related items.

## 4.2.4 Elevators :

They should always be taken out of service for cleaning. The necessary signboards  indicating  that  cleaning  is  being  carried  out  must  be  displayed prominently. Elevator doors are usually made of steel, and sometimes they may be covered with wooden panels. Steel doors show grease marks from fingers easily. Elevators should be cleaned daily, and a more thorough cleaning may be done periodically. The cleaning steps are given below.

- · The steel doors, inside and out, by using neutral detergent solution wipe and clean using water. Dry it with a clean duster.
- · Damp-dust the inside wall panels, door panels and control panel.
- · Suction-clean the elevator floor is carpeted.
- · Suction-clean the door tracks on all the floors using a crevice-cleaner attachment on the vacuum cleaner.
- · Lightly damp dust the ceiling and light fixtures.
- · Clean any air-conditioning or ventilation ducts using a suction cleaner.

## 4.2.5 Staircases :

The  appropriate  way  to  clean  staircases  is  to  divide  them  into  half lengthways  and  clean  one  half  at  a  time.  This  is  required  to  prevent  dirty footprints on a wet floor and as a safety precaution so that there are no accidents due to slipping on wet steps. The various cleaning tasks may be carried out at different periodicities daily, weekly, or less often. While cleaning staircases, care should be taken that dirt and debris do not fall downwards through the gaps in bannisters and railings. Any kind of sweeping should be directed towards the wall. Carpets should be suction cleaned daily, and any stains should be attended to immediately. Due to practical reasons, a backpack type of vacuum cleaner is best for  suction-cleaning  staircases.  Hard-floored  staircases  should  be  suctioncleaned and then damp-mopped. They can be scrubbed weekly with a deck scrubber using a neutral detergent.

## 4.2.6 Guest Corridors :

The  guest  corridor  should  be  divided  into  sections  for  cleaning.  The corridor should be divided into half lengths so that the other half is open for use while one half is being cleaned. Appropriate cautionary signs should be used to indicate that cleaning is in progress. Many hotel corridors are fully carpeted. These carpets should be attractive and sturdy, and durable to withstand everyday wear and tear. The carpet should be vacuum cleaned daily. It also needs to be shampooed once in six months-this may be scheduled as a special project in the off-season periods. The wall skirting or baseboards all along the corridor should be cleaned. Thorough cleaning of walls may be done weekly. The exit and

Cleaning of Public Areas

## House Keeping Management

entrance doors on the corridor should be damp dusted on both sides, and the tracks cleaned. Brass knobs and handles should be polished once a week.

## 4.2.7 Public Restroom :

The washrooms and toilets are meant for use by the general public and are not restricted to guests at the hotel. Washrooms may have elaborate mirrors, other ornate fixtures, and some pieces of upholstered furniture. The sanitary fittings commonly found in washrooms are WCs, urinals, sluices, bidets and vanity units or pedestal-type washbasins. Public restrooms need to be cleaned twice a day thoroughly at the minimum; when guest traffic is more, the frequency will have to be higher. In lower traffic periods, frequent but light tidying may be required.

## 4.2.8 Banquet Halls :

These may be used for dinners, conferences, conventions, exhibitions etc. When banquet halls have bookings for several functions on the same day, cleaning them becomes more of a challenge. A larger workforce and good organisation will be required on such days. The cleaning process includes daily cleaning tasks and weekly cleaning tasks.

- · Sweep and mop the floor area well before the event. If the area is carpeted, a vacuum cleaner should be used.
- · Damp-dust or suction-clean the furniture.
- · Tablecloths, chair covers, and decorative bows should be replaced if dirty.
- · Lighting fixtures should be checked.
- · Flower arrangements, mineral water, glasses, and other specific requirements such as notepads and pencils should be provided and arranged neatly in place.

## 4.2.9 Leisure Areas :

Hotel leisure areas include the health club, saunas and solariums, swimming pool, spas and changing areas. These are areas meant for the recreation and relaxation of guests.

Health Club : The equipment in health clubs includes treadmills, bench presses, rowing machines, cycling machines, dumbbells, etc. The flooring in health clubs should be non-slippery and should not be polished to a very high shine, or else it will not provide good friction for anti-skid properties. The walls will usually have several mirrored panels. Health clubs also have shower cubicles and lockers. The cleanliness of the whole area, including the equipment, is the housekeeping department's responsibility.

Saunas and Solariums : Saunas are steam-bath cubicles made of wood or glass. Solariums are enclosed glass areas for the enjoyment or therapeutic use of sunrays.

Cleaning of Saunas : The insides of saunas are prone to mould, as they are warm and moist over long periods. Moss may collect outside too, where there is a lot of moisture. To clean saunas, bleach should be added as a cleaning agent to the water, and a nylon scrubber needs to be used. A concentrated solution of bleach should be used in the most badly affected areas. After cleaning with the bleach, the sauna should be rinsed thoroughly with cold water to remove all residual bleach. The sauna should then be left open to dry so that the fumes from the bleach dissipate. A deodoriser may be used to counteract the smell of the bleach too.

Cleaning Solariums : This primarily involves cleaning the glass panels. A proprietary glass-cleaner or a solution of vinegar in water is used for this purpose.

Swimming Pools, Spas and Changing Rooms : Regular cleaning of swimming pools is essential from the point of view of hygiene. If they are not cleaned to a regular schedule, it creates a problem may become carriers of waterborne infections. The swimming pool's water becomes contaminated with body fats and oils, sweat, saliva, urine, cosmetics, and airborne dust particles. However, ideally, the pool should contain as few bacteria as drinking water. The daily cleaning of the swimming pool usually comes under the purview of the housekeeping department. The primary concerns in cleaning swimming pools are water clarity and water chemistry control. Water clarity results from effective filtration to remove all particulate matter. When filters are not effective, they may need cleaning by a backwash cycle, in which a reversed water flow is created through the valves. This forces the discharge of debris into the sewer system.

Water  chemistry  control  implies  the  chemical  safety  of  the  water  for swimming. It involves the maintenance of a neutral ph to control the growth of harmful bacteria in the pool water. If the water is too alkaline, the sides and bottom of the pool will become slippery and prone to black algae. If the water is too acidic, it may deteriorate the pool finish and damage the pump. Chlorine or bromine was earlier used for this purpose but now are discouraged because of specific health hazards such as eye irritation, hair loss and skin rashes resulting from  exposure  to  these.  Spa  baths  are  small  pools  of  warm  water  with  a temperature maintained at a maximum of 39°C. Jacuzzis are small pools in which alternate jets of warm water bring about therapeutic effects. They are cleaned in the same way as swimming pools.

## 4.3 BRIEFING  AND  SCHEDULING  OF  STAFF  :

## 4.3.1 Briefing :

It is the process at the beginning of a work shift that is provided by management to facilitate two-way communication between management and staff. It is the one time during a shift that all housekeeping staff share information and feelings before they disperse to their work areas. It is usually undertaken where all employees must report on duty at the beginning of the shift. This is after the employees have formally clocked into the hotel at the time office and have  already  received  their  fresh  uniforms,  which  they  change  into  their respective locker rooms. All employees must report for briefing properly attired and at the scheduled commencement of the shift or earlier. In Housekeeping, the briefing is conducted at a prescribed common Housekeeping Lounge or the Housekeeping Control Room. Ideally, the Executive Housekeeper must conduct the briefing; however, they may delegate this to a deputy due to odd shift timings.

- should be attended immediately.

Cleaning of Public Areas

## House Keeping Management

## 4.3.2 Grooming :

Housekeeping staff are mostly in guest visibility and contact areas, and it is thus essential that they are well-groomed and clean. While grooming projects the image and quality of the hotel, a guest also likes to feel that the people who clean his room are themselves very clean. It is thus essential for the Housekeeper to ensure the following :

- · Personal cleanliness - fingernails should be clean and cut short; men should shave and emit no body odour.
- · Hair should be clean and neatly combed/arranged. Hairnets are suggested but not essential.
- · Little or no make-up
- · Careful use of lipsticks for maids
- · No necklaces or bracelets; earrings, if worn, must be small and unobtrusive.
- · Uniforms must be clean and well pressed.
- · Shoes should be dark in colour, low-heeled and clean.

## 4.3.3 Policies and Procedures :

Any  new  policies  and  procedures  laid  by  the  management  should  be informed among the staff.

## 4.3.4 VIPs in the hotel :

Before starting with daily work, the in-house guest names, room numbers, and the importance of each VIP staying in the hotel must be communicated to all staff, especially those assigned to their floors.

## 4.3.5 Allotment of Duties :

During the time of the briefing, the duties of each staff member and the areas of accountability are given. It means the floor and the number of rooms allotted to that room attendant. The public area attendants, likewise, are told which public areas they are assigned to for cleaning. They are also informed which supervisor would be in charge.

## 4.3.6 Feedback of Staff :

The Executive Housekeeper talks to the staff to receive any professional or personal grievances of staff. This helps resolve the problem and ultimately improves the productivity or at least heard to resolve them. This can also be an opportunity to test out whether policies and procedures already explained have been understood and implemented.

## 4.3.7 Standards of Performance :

Each staff is allotted to certain areas and is given a specific task for a shift in  day  to  complete  by  an  Executive  Housekeeper.  And  they  are  constantly reminded of the standards expected by management from them. Standards could be the number of rooms to be completed by a maid in her shift or the time taken to complete a departure room. At the time of briefing and de-briefings, the housekeeping  staff  should  get  feedback,  and  corrective  actions  should  be informed on whether they are maintaining the required standards.

## 4.3.8 Recognition and Praise :

When shift staff gather for a short briefing, the Housekeeper should praise and encourage good work and recognise deserving candidates.

## BLOCK SUMMARY

This block covered different types of cleaning equipment used by the housekeeping staff to perform cleaning and regular maintenance of all areas of the hotel. The types, usage, care, and storage of various equipment categories have been discussed in detail with pictures for a better understanding of the students. Proper use and correct maintenance will help in increasing the life expectancy of the equipment. Nowadays, equipment may be multipurpose; hence the housekeeper should select user-friendly equipment and get maximum functions out of it. Cleaning agents also need to be considered very carefully so that it is not dangerous for the employees to use, and proper guidelines should be set for their usage.

The guestroom is the most crucial product that hotels sell to generate revenue. In this section, we covered the importance and types of guestrooms that are there in a hotel. It is imperative to maintain the overall look of the place by providing a proper hygienic ambience to the guest. Hence daily cleaning of the guestroom is critical. The guests who come to stay expect a certain level of hygiene and cleanliness for their price. It is the responsibility of the housekeeper to set cleaning standards and ensure they are followed. Efficient cleaning will satisfy guests, which in turn will generate favourable reviews and lead to repeat business.  The  last  portion  of  the  block  deals  with  public  areas  and  their maintenance. It is essential to maintain the standard as it builds up the first impression for the guest. The workflow of cleaning these areas is well distributed throughout the day for housekeeping public area attendant. Some hotels may outsource this cleaning service.

## ROLE OF SELF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL IN DISTANCE LEARNING

The need to plan effective instruction is imperative for a successful distance teaching repertoire. This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## PREFACE

We have put in lots of hard work to make this book as userfriendly as possible, but we have not sacrificed quality. Experts were involved in preparing the materials. However, concepts are explained in easy language for you. We  have included many tables and examples for easy understanding.

We sincerely hope this book will help you in every way you expect. All the best for your studies from our team!

## OTHER AREAS OF THE HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT

## Block Introduction :

The first unit in the block discusses the control desk, the nerve centre for the housekeeping department.

The  second  unit  in  the  block  focuses  on  the  basic  security  and  safety measures and practices that all the hotel staff should be aware of. Since a hotel is a place of temporary accommodation for many guests and an organisation that employs a high workforce from different backgrounds, it is very important to have basic  security  and  safety  policies  in  place.  Notably,  such  policies  should  be adhered  to  in  all  the  areas  of  the  hotel.  The  unit  discusses  the  measures  that employees are expected to take in emergencies and the general safety precautions to  be  taken  to  avoid  any  mishaps.

The Lost and Found section of the housekeeping department is also stressed upon,  as  it  is  a  department  that  deals  with  guests'  lost  valuables/unclaimed materials found on the premises of the hotel.

The last unit discusses pest control management which the housekeeping department does.

## Block Objectives :

- · Describe the importance and role of the housekeeping control desk.
- · Discuss the role of the control desk in coordination with other departments.
- · Identify the  potential hazards  in housekeeping.
- · Compare the different types of keys.
- · Outline the procedures for dealing with lost and found items.
- · Identify the  characteristics of common pests found in hotels.

## 1.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we will discuss the housekeeping control desk and state its functions.

## After going through this portion, students would be able to understand :

- · Understand the importance and role of the housekeeping control desk.
- · List down the forms, formats and registers that are used at the desk.
- · Discuss the role of the control desk in coordination with other departments.
- · Explain the method of handling calls using standard phrases.
- · Discuss the steps of handling guest transfers

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION  :

The housekeeping control desk is a one-point contact for all activities. It helps in good coordination with other departments and a constant link with different areas of the hotel where housekeeping employees are working. Complete coordination with the front office regarding room status information and with the maintenance department regarding any guestroom maintenance issues. Apart from

## House  Keeping Management

keeping inter and intradepartmental communication, it also receives messages of in-house guests related to any request or complaint. The control desk is where the housekeeping staff report for duty in all shifts, issuing respective area keys, handing over from one shift to the other, all takes place in this area.

The control desk area consists of :

- · A key cabinet (to store all the keys of respective areas)
- · A notice board (to put all information for staff to go through daily)
- ·
- Number of Registers (to update all operational details)

This area is staffed round the clock for a better flow of communication and smooth workflow.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

- 1. Which of the following is not kept at the control desk ?
- a. Registers
- b. Key cabinet
- c. Roll-away Bed

## 1.2 DUTIES  OF  A  CONTROL  DESK  SUPERVISOR  :

- · Coordinate with the front office for information on departure rooms and handing over of cleanrooms
- · Coordinate with other departments for smooth functioning and efficiency
- · Receive complaints on maintenance and housekeeping
- · Maintain registers kept at the control desk
- · Receive special requests from guests
- · Responsible for guestroom keys given to room attendants and to storing the keys, and maintaining a key register

Control Desk needs to have close coordination with Front Office. This is essential to ensure that the rooms are made available for sale at the right time to have maximum occupancy and resultant high revenues and sales. The desk attendant receives departure notification from the front office, which must be transmitted onwards to the appropriate floor so that the rooms can be cleaned and made ready for sale. Once the rooms are cleared, the floor supervisor calls the desk attendant, handing over the cleaned rooms. The desk attendant informs the front  office  regarding  the  cleared  rooms.  The  desk  attendant  also  receives information that requires special attention from Housekeeping. These may be as follows:

VIPs in the House : Knowledge of important guests and their rooms assist the housekeeping department in taking extra care of the guest, ensuring cleanliness, placement of amenities, minibar etc., as per house policies.

Groups  in  the  House  : Since  groups  stay  in  the  house  under  time parameters, it becomes essential to clean their rooms at a set time together. The groups move together during arrivals, departure and sightseeing or for meals, and various activities must be coordinated by the Housekeeping.

Airline Crews : The airline crews are accommodated on specific floors in predetermined rooms. The arrivals and departures of these groups generally overlap, so the rooms need clearance quickly. Due to odd timings, these rooms may be unavailable for cleaning, so alternate rooms might have to be made available by the Housekeeping.

Flowers : Important guests receive special attention in the house, and sometimes the management extends its compliments by a unique gesture of arranging flower arrangements, complimentary fruit baskets, a tray of in-house chocolates or minibar. Housekeeping must ensure that flowers are sent to the correct room number at the right time or changed as per house policies.

The control desk must coordinate closely with the maintenance department as all maintenance work is generally communicated to the control desk. The control desk needs to inform the maintenance department and get the work done at the earliest. The desk uses maintenance job orders to communicate the work to be done by or maintenance carried out by the engineering department at specified times. Some operations use maintenance registers giving room numbers, the nature of the complaint, and the attendant who lodged the complaint.

## 1.3 RECORDS AND  REGISTERS  MAINTAINED  :

Many records and registers are maintained at the housekeeping control desk. The following are:

Key Control Register : The key register plays a crucial role in maintaining proper control over every shift's key issuing and handover process. The employee collects  their  respective  area  key  and  signs  it  in  the  key  control  register mentioning the time and name.

## House  Keeping Management

Maintenance Register : This register is used to record all maintenance work needed in the areas according to that work orders are generated by the control desk supervisor.

Lost and Found Register : This register is of great importance as the missing items may be found later, and there should be a record giving the details of the item. Also, sometimes there may be a pattern in the articles missing from guestrooms, and the name of a single employee may be found involved in each case.

## Lost and Found Log

Room Transfer Record : The control desk should keep a record of all room  transfers  since  this  information  may  be  required  at  a  later  stage.  For instance, any small guest article left behind in an earlier room can be quickly delivered to the appropriate room by referring to these records.

Area Inventory List : An inventory of all items in a room is maintained. If furniture, accessories, or articles are moved from one guestroom or location to another in the hotel, it must be recorded.

Guest Message Register : The housekeeping Control Desk is a point of contact for in-house guests who requires any housekeeping related services. Guest requests are received at the desk and then delivered to the concerned area staff.

Deep Cleaning Schedule Register : All additional cleaning tasks are noted with  the  date  and  name  of  the  employee  performing  the  task,  like  carpet shampooing.

Incident Report : Records all accidents that employees or guests have met with at the hotel.

Stores Indent Book : The stores indent book is at the control desk. The supervisors  indent  for  housekeeping  supplies  that  the  guest  room  attendant requires. The supervisors fill up the indent sheet in the book, and the desk supervisor forwards it to stores after approval for the issue of supplies.

##  Room Checklist File :

All room inspection checklists are filed in the room inspection checklists file kept at the control desk. These reports may be referred to in case there are guest complaints on cleaning. The executive housekeeper will find the supervisor in charge of inspecting the guestroom in this file and confirm whether he or she checked the surface in question.

## 1.4 COMMUNICATION  PROCESS  :

There are some critical tasks that Control Desk must perform in addition to what has been described above. These tasks are essential and must be carried out to ensure operational efficiency and guest satisfaction. Some critical tasks performed are:

## 1.4.1 Handling Telephone Calls :

The control desk manages intra- and inter-departmental communication and handles telephone calls. It is always advantageous when the hotels have a telephone policy to strictly adhere to the procedures of answering, transferring, and making telephone calls.

## Answering the calls

- · Answer calls promptly generally should be within the third ring.
- · Answer politely and talk distinctly.
- · Start with a greeting apt for the time of day.
- · Introduce yourself by name.
- · Identify your department.
- · Ask how you may be of assistance.
- · Listen to the caller attentively and let them finish speaking before replying.
- · Request any other information required for you to clarify what precisely the caller needs. Understand their needs completely.
- · Ascertain the caller's name and identity.
- · Take the proposed action and get back to the caller to inform them of what has been done.

If the assistance required is not in your hands or the kind of assistance needed is another employee's responsibility, transfer the call to the concerned person.

## 1.4.2 Transferring the Calls :

When you have understood the caller's needs but cannot provide assistance, transfer the call to a staff member you know will fulfil the requirement. Before transferring a call, inform the name and department of the person they are being connected to. When the concerned person is online, explain the caller's requirements briefly and then make the connection. If you find the extension is busy, inform the caller of this and ask whether they would like to be called back later or hold the line for some minutes. Take the caller's contact number and ask for an ideal time to call back in the former case.

## House  Keeping Management

## 1.4.3 To Hold the Calls :

When a caller is holding the line to be connected, they may feel the wait has been too long even though it may be just a few seconds' delay. This is a natural reaction while holding a call. Therefore, you should frequently check whether the caller still wishes to remain on hold or wants to be called back. While the caller is on hold, you can put on the 'on-hold' music. Avoid leaving the caller unattended for too long. Before finally connecting the line, inform the caller that you are connecting them now.

## 1.4.4 Taking the Messages :

There are situations when you must take messages on some other employee's or guest's behalf. Write the message down on a message pad with a pencil. Take the message accurately. Ensure that you fill in the date, time, name of the person for whom the message is intended, caller's name, contact number, and a brief description of the message. Inform the caller that you will pass on the message as  soon  as  possible.  After  disconnecting,  ensure  that  the  concerned  person receives the message as quickly as possible.

## 1.4.5 Making a Call :

Before making a call, ascertain whether and why it is needed. Decide on what you are going to convey. If required, make notes to help you put forth the points. Dial the number or the extension of the person you want and ask for them. Convey the information you must deliver or request for information you need clearly. Thank the person on the line.

## 1.4.6 Handling Difficult Situations :

There may be some unexpected difficulties that the housekeeping department may have to deal with. The control desk plays a significant role in handling such situations. Situations may include an emergency such as a fire, a worker or a guest meeting  with  an  accident,  the  aftermath  of  a  guest  complaint  or  a  security problem. Alertness and presence of mind are helpful traits in dealing with difficult situations and should be cultivated in individual employees. Ideally, all kinds of difficult situations in a hotel should be identified, and procedures should be set for  dealing  with  such  situations.  Moreover,  employees  should  be  trained  in handling difficult situations through role-play, demonstrations, and drills.

## 1.4.7 Handling Room Transfers :

The control desk often must coordinate a 'room transfer' for a guest who may wish to be transferred to a room other than the one they have been registered in. The guest may request this change due to many reasons-the small size of the room currently allotted, acoustic reasons (for instance, the room is next to the elevator), the view from the room not being scenic, the room costing more than the guest's budget, etc. Once the front desk gives permission for the room transfer and provides an alternative room number to the housekeeping control desk, a supervisor and an attendant are assigned to help the guest with the transfers. All hotels have guidelines and policies laid out for handling room transfers. All the housekeeping employees' concerned need to know these policies. Hence room transfer registers come out of utmost importance.

## House  Keeping Management

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Safety and security are two major responsibilities of the hotel's management team.  Guests  coming  to  the  hotel  seek  a  safe  and  sound  environment  for themselves and are entitled to reasonable care under the law. Security refers to handling all kinds of emergencies and providing guests with a safe environment within the hotel. The two departments in a hotel prone to accidents or injuries are housekeeping and maintenance, which involves a lot of physical activity and equipment handling. The executive housekeeper should be aware of the potential safety hazards and develop procedures to prevent accidents and reduce the risks. Hence it is the responsibility of the executive housekeeper to maintain safe working conditions and provide an ongoing safety training program to all staff. Ongoing safety training programs help to ensure safe working conditions are maintained in all areas.

## 2.2 POTENTIAL HAZARDS IN HOUSEKEEPING :

Due to the nature of the work performed by housekeeping staff, they may be exposed to many dangerous and unsafe conditions or hazards if they are not careful. To reduce safety risks, all employees should be aware of potential safety hazards. These hazards may include :

- · Faulty equipment
- · Damaged flooring or chipped tiles
- · Slippery floors and spills not mopped
- · Slippery guest bathrooms
- · Cracked or broken glass
- · Cleaning agents left uncapped
- · Non-adherence to instructions outlined in the material safety data sheets
- · Handling corrosive cleaning agents with bare hands
- · Worn out electrical insulation or fittings
- · Overload electrical sockets
- · Trailing equipment flexes
- · Cleaning equipment left lying around
- · Unsafe use of ladders
- · Inadequate lighting
- · Loose stair treads
- · Mixing certain chemical cleaners, causing undesirable/dangerous reactions
- · Cleaning agents kept in unmarked or wrongly marked containers
- · Incorrect use of trolleys
- · Wrong methods of bending and lifting
- · Unsatisfactory hygiene and sanitation
- · Incorrect posture

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

Potential Hazards Are :

- a. Incorrect posture
- b. Unsafe use of ladders
- c. Making a guestroom without assistance.

## 2.3 BASIC  GUIDELINES  FOR  THE  PREVENTION  OF ACCIDENTS  :

The following guidelines can be followed for the prevention of accidents :

- · Always follow instructions when using any cleaning pieces of equipment.
- · Replace  caps  on  cleaning  chemicals  immediately  and  securely  after dispensing.
- · Label cleaning agents.
- · Keep floors clean and dry.
- · Place warning and safety signs around the area while cleaning.
- · Always dry hands before touching plugs, sockets, and electrical fittings.
- · Mark faulty equipment as 'out of order".
- · Dispose of rubbish carefully.

## 2.4 PROCEDURES  TO  BE  FOLLOWED  IN  CASE  OF  AN ACCIDENT  :

- · With the help of another person, check if the victim requires any assistance.
- · Report the matter immediately to the manager concerned.
- · Offer first aid. Either administer first aid or get help from trained personnel.
- · Transport the victim immediately to a hospital if required. If the injury is severe, call an ambulance for the same. Follow all necessary first-aid measures until the ambulance arrives.
- · Fill in the accident report form and hand it over to the manager concerned.

## 2.5 TYPES  OF  FIRES  :

To understand fire prevention and firefighting, one must know how fires are classified. Fires may be classified into five groups based on their source of fuel.

## House  Keeping Management

## Carbon dioxide extinguisher (small size)

<!-- image -->

- · Class  A  : These  are  fires  with  trash,  wood,  paper,  or  other  ordinary combustible materials s their fuel source.
- · Class B : These are fires with flammable or combustible liquids as their fuel source.
- · Class C : These are fires involving electrical equipment
- · Class D : These are fires with certain ignitable metals as the fuel source.
- · Class K : These are fires that are caused due to vegetable oil, animal oil or fats in cooking appliances.

## 2.5.1 Prevention of Fire :

Fires may be prevented if fire hazards are identified and eliminated. Some unsafe practices that may lead to fires are as follows:

- · Guests smoking in bed
- · The hotel not providing sand urns or sufficient and appropriate ashtrays in rooms as well as public areas
- · Using high wattage light bulbs in lamps
- · Leaving linen chute doors open
- · Storing rags and cloths with residues of cleaning polish still on them
- · Not unplugging electrical appliances when not in use
- · Using faulty electrical equipment or sockets
- · Leaving magnifying glasses where the sun can catch them
- · Using easily combustible furnishing materials

## 2.5.2 Fire Warning System :

These may be electrically powered manually operated systems, automatic fire detection systems or a combination of both. The usual components of such systems are discussed here :

Fire alarms can be set off by smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinkler systems, or pull stations. The most common fire alarms are operated by pull stations located in corridors, lobbies and near elevators.

Sprinklers : These are found in most hotel establishments, especially in corridors and rooms. They are situated on the ceiling and automatically spray water when the temperature rises above a certain level.

Smoke Detectors : These are set off by smoke. The two types of smoke detectors available are photoelectric detectors and ionisation detectors. Photoelectric detectors are alarms triggered off when smoke blocks a beam of light emanating from the detector. In the ionisation type of smoke detectors, the alarm sounds when the detector senses a shift in electrical conductivity between two plates.

## 2.5.3 Types of Fire Extinguishers :

Dry Powder : these are usually meant for multipurpose use with the various types of fire. They contain an extinguishing agent and use compressed, non-flammable gas as a propellant.

Dry Chemical Foam : These are used on flammable liquids, oils and fats but may have multipurpose uses.

Halon/Vaporising Liquid : These contain gas or volatile liquid that stops the chemical reaction, which takes place when fuels burn. As they leave no residue to clean up, this type of extinguisher is often used to protect valuable electrical equipment and apparatus. The initial spread of halon should be carried out  at  the  base  of  the  fire,  continuing  even  after  the  flames  have  been extinguished.

Water-Gas or Soda-Acid Extinguishers : These extinguishers contain water and compressed gas and should only be used on class A fires.

Carbon Dioxide : Carbon dioxide-based extinguishers are most effective on class B and C fires (liquids and electrical). Since the gas spreads out quickly, these extinguishers are only effective within 3-8 feet from the fire. The quality of expanding on release; the carbon dioxide is stored as a compressed liquid in the extinguisher. It cools the surrounding air. The cooling effect changes to ice formation around the "horn" from which the gas is expelled. Since the fire could re-ignite, continue to apply the agent even after the fire appears to be out.

## 2.5.4 Fire Protection Checklist :

The manager of each hotel should either personally supervise the use of the checklist or delegate the responsibility for examining the checklist after the engineering department has done the survey. Any items shown as defective after the  review  should  be  promptly  entered  in  a  logbook  for  correction.  The management should follow up and insist that appropriate action be taken on every open item in the logbook until the deficiency is corrected. A notation should be made in the logbook when the defect has been eliminated.

## The following items should be checked monthly :

- · Check all exits and exit lights.
- · Keep stairways on fire escapes unobstructed.
- · Clean air-conditioning filters
- · Check filters, kitchen hoods.
- · Test fire alarm system.

## Safety  and  Security

##  Check Your Progress - 3 :

## Choose the correct option :

Identify the one that should not be cleaned monthly:

- a. Open all sprinkler control valves.
- b. Check fire pump operation.
- c. Clean all electric motors.

## 2.6 FIRST AID :

All housekeeping personnel should be able to administer first aid, since they may be the first ones to attend to a guest or another employee. Many hotels organise training classes by the Red Cross for their housekeeping staff who are awarded certificates in recognition of having completed a first aid programme. This  shows  the  importance  hotels  give  to  skills  of  first  aid  as  inherent  to housekeeping personnel's jobs.

## The first step is to have a first aid cupboard, which should contain :

- · Clinical thermometer
- · Bandage rolls
- · Cotton wool
- · Adhesive dressings
- · Sterilised gauze
- · Tweezers
- · Bedpan and urine bottle
- · Rubber sheeting
- · Safety pins

## The medicines should include :

- · Tincture iodine
- · Tincture benzene
- · Tincture iodine solution
- · Dettol
- · Burnol or Furacin
- · Crocin tablets
- · Aspirins
- · Mercurochrome
- · Fruit salts
- · Antiseptic creams

## Following are some immediate steps in first aid :

- · Burns and Scalds : Apply Burnol liberally. Place burnt area under cold running water or ice. If burns are severe, apply a sterile dressing and send the person to a hospital immediately.
- · Bleeding : Clean the wound with cotton dipped in Dettol. Put dry antiseptic dressing or tincture iodine for bigger wounds. Put pressure on the wound by placing gauze on it and bandaging tightly.
- · Clothes on Fire : Prevent the person from running, smothering flames by wrapping with heavy material, e.g., curtain, blanket, heavy coat.
- · Fainting : Loosen clothing; lay patient flat on back with feet raised or placed in chair bending the head forward between the knees. Apply warmth to lower limbs and rub limbs upwards. Give hot, sweet tea to drink when the patient can take it.

## Safety  and  Security

## House  Keeping

## Management

- · Fracture : Immobilise the limb by tying both legs and arms across the body, respectively. An alternative is to get two boards and tie the leg or arm between them. Send for a doctor.
- · Heart Attack : Call for a doctor immediately. Do not move a person from the room; clear all other people. If critical, try artificial respiration by mouth-to-mouth method.
- · Insect Sting : Apply soda-bicarbonate soaked in solution or paste over the inflamed area.
- · Object in The Eye : Do not let the eye be rubbed. Use an eye bath with warm water to rinse out the eye. If no improvement, check the eye against light and locate any foreign matter. Remove it with the corner of a clean handkerchief. If foreign material is embedded in the eyeball, do not get it out. Drop two drops of castor oil in the eye, cover the eye with a soft pad, bandage lightly and take to a doctor.
- · Sprain : Apply a dry bandage firmly wrapped around the affected part and soak with cold water. Rest the limb.
- · Shock : Rest the patient by laying them on the couch. Loosen the clothing; give warmth by hot beverage and hot water bottle. Keep the surrounding area silent.

## 2.7 PREVENTION  FOR  EMERGENCIES  :

All  properties  must  have  a  crime  prevention  committee  or  a  security committee. The committee should consist of key management personnel, including department heads. The supervisors and other selected employees can also be roped in for valuable information and inputs.

The committee members should meet on a scheduled basis periodically to review past plans and form new ones.

## The general responsibilities of this committee should be to :

- · Design a security booklet for all employees.
- · Develop  orientation  and  training  programmes  on  crime  prevention  in coordination with the training department.
- · Analyse and resolve recurring security issues. Investigate any securityrelated incidents.
- · Conduct spot security checks and inspections of the property.
- · Liaise with the local police department
- · Monitor the keeping records and documentation of all security-related incidents.

## 2.7.1 Dealing with Bomb Threats :

As an example of dealing with emergencies, the procedure for dealing with a bomb threat is outlined below :

Bomb threats may be delivered in writing or orally, in person or over the telephone. Nowadays, threats are also sent over the Internet.

In case of a written threat in the form of a letter, note or telegram, the message and the envelope should be handled carefully and held only at the corners to  preserve  fingerprints  and  other  evidence.  Protect  the  document  and  the envelope and hand it over to the general manager. Inform the police of the contents of the note.

In case the bomb threat was made orally, as in any employee becoming aware of the bomb threat through personal contact or by overhearing someone make such a threat, the person should immediately convey the information to the general manager in a discreet manner so as not to alarm the guest. The police should be informed promptly. If possible, the person issuing the threat should be kept under observation and the person's physical characteristics noted. These may include the person's height, weight, build, the colour of hair and eyes, description of clothes and jewellery or any other scar or marks on the face etc. These facts should be furnished to the General Manager immediately for communication to security personnel and the police.

The  most  usual  way  in  which  a  bomb  threat  is  received  is  over  the telephone.  The  switchboard  operators  usually  receive  them  from  the  public telephone number, and the call is typically brief so that there is no chance to trace the number. Therefore, switchboard operators should record the information accurately  to  provide  the  security  and  the  police  personnel  with  as  much documented information as possible.

Housekeeping employees may also be part of the search team looking for unclaimed, unidentified, or unusual foreign objects that could contain the bomb. All housekeeping employees should be aware of the evacuation plans explained in the safety manual of the property and help in evacuation in case it is necessary. In case of an explosion, the employees should help in the rescue process and provide first aid when required.

## 2.7.2 Scanty Baggage :

A guestroom with a guest checking in with very light luggage is coded as 'scanty baggage'. Such guests can quickly turn 'skipper' by just walking out of the hotel without settling their account. Therefore, most organisations follow a policy that 'scanty baggage' guests should pay a deposit in advance to safeguard against skipping out of the hotel. When such a guest checks into the hotel, the front office assistant stamps 'scanty baggage' on the guest's registration card and enters the particulars in the scanty baggage register. The lobby manager or the front office manager must sign the registration card and the scanty baggage register and has the discretion to ask for a deposit from the guest. Housekeeping employees must report any suspicious movements of such guests to their manager.

## 2.7.3 Guest and Employee Theft :

All hotels face the problem of employee and guest thefts at some time or the other. The management can reduce the volume of soft goods, fixtures and equipment stolen from the property by reducing the opportunity to steal.

- · Proper supervision of hotel amenities
- · Eye for detail during the check-in and check-out procedures
- · To keep the amenities to a minimum in the guests' room and they should be with logo or monogram

## Safety  and  Security

## House  Keeping Management

- · To reduce guests' thefts, items such as monogrammed towels, bathrobes, etc., may be placed on sale in hotel gift shops. This may reduce the likelihood of theft since guests have the option of purchasing these items.
- · Minute  observation  can  be  kept  on  the  maid's  carts,  lying  along  the corridors during the room cleaning process.
- · All  the  pictures  and  frames  connected  to  the  wall  should  be  affixed discreetly to make them difficult to remove from the wall.
- · Expensive items such as televisions should be bolted and equipped with an alarm that alerts the front desk or security if an attempt is made to remove the item.

## The management should have explicit regulations concerning employee theft.

- · While screening applicants for the job, a thorough check of the background, including any criminal convictions, should be carried out, gaps in the employment history, all references should be cross-checked etc.
- · Orientation  and  training  programmes  should  emphasise  the  value  of honesty.
- · Good inventory control procedures should be followed. Conduct a monthly inventory of all housekeeping supplies, such as toilet paper, amenities, and linen.
- · All storeroom doors should be kept locked, and these locks should be changed periodically to reduce the opportunity for theft.
- · An effective key control programme, lost and found procedure, and the gate-pass system should be in place and enforced at all times.
- · Regular locker inspections also discourage employees from stealing for lack of a hiding place for articles.
- · Employee  entrances  should  have  a  security  staff  office  that  monitors arriving and departing employees.
- · Employee parking should be well lighted and sufficiently far from the hotel building.

## 2.7.4 Sickness and Death :

On many occasions, housekeepers find sick guests on their hands. Guests too ill to travel, as in the case of overseas travellers, should be attended by a doctor on call.

If medical aid is on the way, the housekeeper may have to administer first aid to the ailing guest. The housekeeping staff should regularly visit unwell hotel guests. In a contagious illness, the general manager or the doctor should inform the local health authorities.

Sometimes an illness or an accident may lead to death. Staff who encounter such a situation should not touch anything in the room, as they might help establish the cause of death. The employee should lock the door and inform the executive housekeeper, who conveys the information to the general manager. The police are then informed about the death. The guestroom where a death has occurred should be double-locked and sealed until the police have arrived. The staff should assist in any subsequent investigations being carried out by the authorities.

When a dead body is being taken away from the hotel, using the service exit will discreetly ensure other guests are not disturbed and any panic is avoided.

## 2.13 CASE STUDY :

The Quick Stop Motel was a small property with a limited staff. It was the first hotel built in the city when the expressway came through forty years earlier.

Juanita looked up and smiled as a guest came toward her cart. "Good afternoon Mr Tills." "I bet u think its good afternoon," Mr Tills snarled at her. "Best afternoon of your life"

"Sir?" Juanita queried, looking bewildered.

"Oh, the very picture of innocence!" he said sarcastically. "I suppose u don't know anything about my wife's earrings". Juanita's eyes got wide, and she shook her head slowly. "Sir, I don't know what you are talking about."

"The earrings you stole from my wife. She left them in the room after she took them off last night and this afternoon they were gone - after you had cleaned the room. If you fork them over right now, maybe I won't tell your supervisor".

Juanita continued to shake her head, "Sir I do not steal things, I am not a thief".

"Then would you care to tell me where they are? Surely you are not so obtuse that you would vacuum up a pair of $1,000 diamond earrings!" "Sir, no, I…………."

"Forget it," Mr Tills snapped at her, I'll just go the front desk, and you can be sure if I don't get them back, I'll have that $1,000 out of your paycheck!"

Mr Tills turned and stomped off to the front desk, leaving a distraught Juanita,  who  immediately  abandoned  her  cart  and  headed  straight  for  the housekeeping offices. She entered the stock room where Cindy, the executive housekeeper, was going over inventory with the assistant executive housekeeper, Candice.

"Miss Volk, a guest just accused me of being a thief", Juanita burst out.

Cindy set her clipboard down. Juanita seemed on the verge of either crying or screaming. Cindy wished once again that the hotel had security officers who could handle this situation. She mentioned to Candice to follow her and gently said, "Juanita, let's go sit in my office and you can tell me what happened."

The three quickly retreated to the executive housekeeper's office, where Cindy sat down beside Juanita, and Candice sat on the chair behind the table.

"Ok, Juanita you seem very upset. What happened?" Cindy asked.

"Mr Tills said I stole his wife's earrings, and he is going to have $1,000 held out of my paycheck. How am I supposed to feed my family if I have to give

him that amount? Miss. Volk, I have worked for this hotel for 20 years, and no one has ever called me a thief! I don't have to put up with this.

"Well, I am not going to call you a thief, Juanita. Take a deep breath and let me ask you some questions so we can try to sort this out. Did you clean the Tillses room this morning?"

"Yes, but I didn't even see any earrings!"

"So, the earrings weren't there when you cleaned the room?"

"How should I know? I didn't go through her purse or their suitcases."

"What time did you clean the room?"

It was around 9:30 A.M. I saw the Tillses leave for breakfast and wanted to get their room clean for them before they returned."

"Did you observe any unusual activity around the guestroom? Did anyone else enter the room or try the door?"

"I am not sure," Juanita answered. "But Evans was working the rooms across the hall; he might have seen something. I only cleaned the poolside rooms on that floor. There was a basketball team checking into rooms down the hall."

"Ok. When you cleaned the room did you move their suitcases and open the drawers?"

"Let me try to remember, it was my second room they had a makeup bag on the bed that I moved to the nightstand so I could make the bed." Juanita said, "I didn't open the drawers - I never do in stayover rooms."

Mark called from the front office to inform the guest complaint about the stolen item.

## Question :

- 1. Study the situation and list down steps that Cindy should take to investigate the situation.

## 3.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In  this  unit,  we  have  discussed  the  key  handling  procedures  by  the housekeeping department. Proper handling of guest belongings left behind by mistake and found by the hotel employees is left at the housekeeping department to make a proper entry.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Describe the procedures for the control of keys.
- · List the different types of keys.
- · Explain the procedures for dealing with lost and found items.
- · Discuss the categorisation of lost and found for better handling of the items.

## 3.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Keys are essential for the safety and security of the guests and as well as for the hotel. Every lock in the hotel should have a different key, and an authorised person can only access it. Different locking systems are used in hotels like:

- · For smaller establishments, generally, the traditional metal lock and key is used.
- · Built-in door lock with a double locking system using a traditional key system.
- · Built-in door lock with a double locking system opened using a key card system.

Lost and Found procedure is one in which unclaimed articles found in the hotel premises should be handed over to the housekeeping control desk. A proper entry and storage should be done of the item as we are dealing with guest belongings.

## 3.2 TYPES OF KEYS :

## Keys that are used in the hotels are :

- · Guestroom Keys
- · Floor Master Keys
- · Section Master Keys
- · Grand Master Key/Emergency Key
- · Supply Rooms Keys

Guestroom Keys are handed to the registered guest on their arrival. The guestroom keys do not have the room number on them for security reasons. If the guest misplaces the key, it is difficult to trace back. All the keys are coded, and the coding details are maintained at the front desk and recycling of keys are possible by changing the codes.

Floor Master Key operates on all sections of a floor that a floor supervisor supervises. This key is used to examine a room after the housekeeping attendant does the cleaning work.

Section Master-Key operates all rooms that are assigned to an individual for cleaning on a floor. It can access the rooms in that section except for the ones that are double locked.

Grand Master Key opens all hotel guestrooms, including the doublelocked rooms. This key is used for emergencies by the manager to access any area of the hotel.

Supply Room Keys are used within the supervisory level of staff to ensure that equipment, chemicals, and supplies are safely stored away when not in use.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

Identify the function of the grand master key.

- a. Are used by the front desk attendant for check-in
- b. Are used by room attendants for cleaning
- c. Are used by managers to handle any emergency.

## 3.3 KEY CONTROL PROCEDURE :

The key controlling procedure helps maintain a system of incoming and outgoing keys from the department, hence reducing theft in the property and any other security-related issues. If the hotel does not have a key card system, the following security measures should be taken:

- · Room keys should not have any tagging which can trace it back to the property.
- · No room number should be mentioned on the key card.

Key  Control  and  Lost and  Found  Procedure

## House  Keeping Management

## 3.3.1 Issuing Keys :

- 1. Guest room Keys : these keys are handed over to the guests on their arrival after completing the registration process. The guest is requested to submit these keys at the front desk whenever he leaves the hotel premises.
- 2. Other Keys : all section master keys, master keys and grand master keys should be signed out each time they are taken, and their return noted in a key control sheet.

## Key Control Sheet

Key control sheet

Date\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Page no.

## 3.3.2 Custody of Keys :

These are the measures to be taken while the key is with a guest or employee after being issued for use.

- · Usually, master keys are to be attached to the belt /uniform of an employee at the beginning of the shift to prevent loss / misplacing.
- · Employees are not allowed to loan the keys assigned to them to one another.
- · Employees must hand over keys whenever they leave the property.
- · Spot checks should take place to ensure that keys are in the right hands.

## 3.3.3 Loss of Keys :

A careful watch must be practised.

- · If a section master key is lost under circumstances that may result in a guest being at risk, the entire section should be re-keyed.
- · If a master key or grand master key is lost under any circumstance, the general  manager  must  report  it  to  the  owner  or  the  corporate  office immediately.

## 3.3.4 Changing Locks and Keys :

Whenever a new key is made or a new lock is fitted, certain precautions are necessary.

- · A record must be kept on how many keys are made for each room, and they are made.
- · A log must be kept of all locks change and re-keys.

##  Check Your Progress - 2 :

Identify the correct key issuing procedure.

- a. Guest room keys are handed to the guest before registration.
- b. The room attendant can carry the keys outside the hotel after their work.
- c. The  incoming  and  outgoing  keys  should  be  entered  with  time  in  the register.

## 3.3.5 Electronic Key Cards :

Electronically coded key cards are replacing traditional room locks and keys. Most of the hotels are nowadays having a key card locking system. While not considered a key, a key card is a plastic card that stores a digital coding used with electronic access to the locks. The Plastic rectangular card looks like a credit card with magnetic strips on the side. The System uses a computer that codes the cards to lock and unlock the doors. Rather than re-keying the door locks in case of loss of keys, the computer is used to create new room lock codes for each room. Master keys may be easily created and destroyed through the computerised card system.

## 3.4 LOST AND  FOUND  PROCEDURE  :

All lost and found articles should be stored in the lost and found cupboard, always kept locked. The lost and found room should be accessible only to the executive housekeeper and the control desk supervisor. A flow-chart explaining the procedure for dealing with the lost and found articles is shown below:

- · Receiving the found article at the control desk.
- · Fill in details in the lost and found logbook; prepare the lost and found form in triplicate.
- · The original copy is kept with the article, which is stored in the lost and found cupboard. The duplicate copy is sent to the front office to obtain data on the guest it may belong to, and the third copy is retained in the lost and found book.
- · The article is stored in an opaque plastic bag with the date of finding and the serial number of the article recorded in the logbook.
- · Receive any enquiry about the lost and found article.
- · Ascertain enquiry with the register.
- · If  satisfied,  issue  the  article,  and  obtain  the  signature  of  the  person collecting the article on the original form.
- · File the original slip, recording the date and time of delivery of the article in the register.

## Following are the contents of the lost and found form:

Date \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## 4.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we have discussed pest control which creates discomfort and disease. These are caused due to improper cleaning or sometimes by not having regular maintenance. Hence the housekeeping department plays a critical role in creating a pest-free environment.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Establish goals for pest control
- · Explain the characteristics of common pests found in hotels
- · Discuss the different methods of pest control.

## 4.1 INTRODUCTION  :

A pest is any organism that transmits the disease to humans and creates discomfort.

Pest creates an enormous amount of damage and causes a massive loss to all the departments in the hotel. The housekeeping department needs to be vigilant in controlling pests by maintaining proper hygiene and cleanliness in all the areas.

In most cases, this service is outsourced by the housekeeping department, but the department still requires constant supervision.

## The reasons for the development of pests :

- · Suitable and undisturbed condition for the growth of pests
- · Humid temperature, prolonged moistness.
- · Untidy place, leftover food residue can create a feeding or breeding space for them
- · Not cleaned or uncovered drains constitute a significant source for rodents.

Regular  pest  control  can  only  eradicate  pest  problems.  Generally,  a professional pest control agency is hired on contract.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

- 1. Identify  the  missing  reason  for  the  growth  of  pests  :
- a. Prolonged moistness
- b. Leftover food

c. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## 4.2 TYPES  AND  METHODS  OF  PEST  CONTROL  :

## 4.2.1 Bed Bugs :

These are tiny parasitic creatures that feed on the blood of humans and other animals.

Symptoms of presence - Itching or rashes on the person sleeping on the bed.

<!-- image -->

Bloodstain on sheets or fluid stain on walls/furniture. Unpleasant odour

## To eradicate an infestation :

- · It is necessary to treat the premises thoroughly by fumigation.
- · Pouring boiling water into crevices is a temporary solution to get rid of bed bugs.
- · A thick application of kerosene oil emulsion is also effective against bed bugs.

## 4.2.2 Cockroaches :

These are several species of nocturnal insects that spend most of the day hiding in cracks, around drains, or in other dark, secluded crevices. Two common species of cockroach are the German and the Oriental.

<!-- image -->

To eradicate : Cockroaches are challenging pests to get rid of.

- · Proprietary  cockroach-killer  preparations  may  be  used  in  the  infested areas.
- · Pest-control experts need to be called if the infestation persists.
- · Maintaining proper hygiene and sanitation.

## 4.2.3 Silverfish :

These are silvery grey insects that look like minute fish without fins. They are nocturnal insects

## House  Keeping Management

primarily found in moist areas and feed on cellulosic materials such as paper and cellulosic fabrics such as cotton.

## To eradicate :

- · Keeping moist areas clean and treating those with insecticides will help to get rid of these pests.

## 4.2.4 Mosquitoes :

Transmits diseases such as malaria, filarial, and yellow fever.

## To Eradicate :

- · Repair and fill all pits and puddles.

<!-- image -->

- · Cover drains and put pesticides into these to prevent larvae from thriving there and growing into adult mosquitoes.
- · Fine gauze on windows prevents the entry of mosquitoes.

## 4.2.5 Mice and Rats

Rats and mice both carry disease germs (such may cause food poisoning; infection; jaundice etc.

## To Eradicate

- Poisoning
- Trapping
- Fumigating
- · To eliminate their food supply & shelter
- · Rat-proof buildings
- · Ultrasonic devices

## 4.2.6 Flies :

These filthy insects are dangerous to health as they contaminate food, causing diseases such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and so on. They carry the disease germs on their legs and in their saliva, and these are transferred to the food on which they sit.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## To Eradicate :

- · The first essential step is to destroy all possible breeding grounds early in the year before egg-laying begins.
- · Burn all garbage and keep dustbins covered and maintain a good standard of cleanliness for the surroundings.
- · Aerosol fly-killer sprays are also effective.

## 4.2.7 Ants :

These  insects  generally  invade  in  large  numbers when  they  come  in  search  of  food,  especially  sweet substances. They enter through crevices and travel along a definite track in a procession.

<!-- image -->

## To Eradicate :

- · The ants can be systematically trapped at the point where they enter an establishment.
- · The vulnerable areas must be emptied of food, thoroughly cleaned, and borax - which repels them- spread over the shelves until the ants cease to come and eventually go to find food elsewhere.

## 4.2.8 Termites :

They are social insects, like ants. They are also called white ants because of their appearance.

## To Eradicate :

- · Soil  should  be  treated  before  the  construction  of  buildings  with  an appropriate termite killer fluid.
- · During construction, wood should not be allowed to come within 6 inches of the ground.
- · Coat any untreated and exposed wood with an appropriate insecticide
- · Seal all cracks and crevices.
- · Increase of infestations lightly puncture, kick out holes and inject an appropriate insecticide into the hole.
- · Saturate infested furniture with Orth dichlorobenzene.

## 4.3 GOALS OF PEST CONTROL :

##  Categories of Pest :

- · Continuous pest nearly always present and require regular control.
- · Sporadic/migratory/cyclic  pest  require  control  occasionally  or intermittently.
- · Potential pests do not require control under normal conditions but may require control in certain circumstances.
- To identify and control pests, one needs to know the following :
- · The physical features of pests
- · Characteristics of damage they cause
- · Their development cycle and biology
- · The goals of the pest management program.

##  Pest control goals are :

- · Prevention: keeping a pest from becoming a problem.
- · Suppression: reducing pest numbers or damage to an acceptable level.
- · Eradication: destroying an entire pest population.

Natural controls through a change of weather conditions affect pest activity sometimes in extreme pests do not survive or other adverse weather conditions. Pest populations survive if there is a food and water supply, or they have shelter to hide.

Mechanical or physical control can be like traps, screens, barriers, fences, nets, radiation & electricity can sometimes be used to prevent the spread of pests into an area.

Pest  Control Management

## House  Keeping Management

Good sanitation, better cleaning methods can eliminate pest growth, timely clearance of garbage, and proper design of the food-handling area help prevent pest infestations. Pesticides are chemicals used to destroy pests, control their activity, or prevent them from causing damage.

- 1. Prevention
- …… a. destroying an entire pest population.
- 2.
- Suppression …… b. keeping a pest from becoming a problem.
- 3. Eradication
- …… c. reducing pest numbers or damage to an acceptable level.

## 4.4 AVOIDING THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF PEST CONTROL :

The Pest Control process involves not only identifying the pest but also the treatment to remove the pest. Whether this treatment is done indoors or outdoors, it needs proper care and precautions for the employees and the guests.

## The following guidelines need to be followed on the use of pesticides :

- · Read the precautions and instructions on the packaging before using and storing.
- · The MSDS (material safety data sheet) needs to be followed and used in the safest and best-controlled method.
- · Store the chemicals away from food, children, and guest area.

This is due to the fact that the  instructional  designer,  the  tutor,  the  author  (s)  and  the student are often separated by distance and may never meet in person.  This  is  an  increasingly  common  scenario  in  distance education instruction. As much as possible, teaching by distance should stimulate the student's intellectual involvement and contain all the necessary learning instructional activities that are capable of guiding the student through the course objectives. Therefore, the course / self-instructional material are completely equipped with everything that the syllabus prescribes.

To ensure effective instruction, a number of instructional design ideas are used and these help students to acquire knowledge, intellectual skills, motor skills and necessary attitudinal changes. In this respect, students' assessment and course evaluation are incorporated in the text.

The  nature  of  instructional  activities  used  in  distance education self- instructional materials depends on the domain of learning that they reinforce in the text, that is, the cognitive, psychomotor and affective. These are further interpreted in the acquisition  of  knowledge,  intellectual  skills  and  motor  skills. Students may be encouraged to gain, apply and communicate (orally or in writing) the knowledge acquired. Intellectual- skills objectives may be met by designing instructions that make use of students' prior knowledge and experiences in the discourse as the foundation on which newly acquired knowledge is built.

The  provision  of  exercises  in  the  form  of  assignments, projects and tutorial feedback is necessary. Instructional activities that teach motor skills need to be graphically demonstrated and the  correct  practices  provided  during  tutorials.  Instructional activities for inculcating change in attitude and behavior should create  interest  and  demonstrate  need  and  benefits  gained  by adopting the required change. Information on the adoption and procedures for practice of new attitudes may then be introduced.

Teaching and learning at a distance eliminates interactive communication cues, such as pauses, intonation and gestures, associated  with  the  face-to-face  method  of  teaching.  This  is

particularly so with the exclusive use of print media. Instructional activities built into the instructional repertoire provide this missing interaction between the student and the teacher. Therefore, the use of instructional activities to affect better distance teaching is not optional, but mandatory.

Our team of successful writers and authors has tried to reduce this.

Divide and to bring this Self Instructional Material as the best teaching  and  communication  tool.  Instructional  activities  are varied in order to assess the different facets of the domains of learning.

Distance education teaching repertoire involves extensive use of self- instructional materials, be they print or otherwise. These materials are designed to achieve certain pre-determined learning outcomes, namely goals and objectives that are contained in an instructional plan. Since the teaching process is affected over a distance, there is need to ensure that students actively participate in their learning by performing specific tasks that help them to understand the relevant concepts. Therefore, a set of exercises is built into the teaching repertoire in order to link what students and tutors do in the framework of the course outline. These could be in the form of students' assignments, a research project or a science practical exercise. Examples of instructional activities in distance education are too numerous to list. Instructional activities, when used in this context, help to motivate students, guide and measure students' performance (continuous assessment)

## HOUSEKEEPING FUNCTIONAL AREAS

## Block Introduction :

In previous units, you have studied the basic concepts and functions of the housekeeping department, types of room, rules to be followed on the guest floor by the housekeeping staff and their importance.

The first and third unit in this block focuses on the linen handling and laundry procedure with various tasks performed in the laundry. It also tries to explain the meaning of the laundry procedure and its importance in the hospitality industry. In an establishment where linen is changed frequently, its life is more often  given  as  perhaps  200-250  washes  rather  than  four  to  five  years.  The relationship  between  housekeeping  and  laundry  is  essential  for  the  smooth functioning  of  the  housekeeping  department.  The  laundry  provides  the housekeeping department with fresh linen and uniforms daily. It also processes the  guest  laundry,  ensuring  guest  satisfaction.  Therefore,  the  housekeeping personnel needs to know something about the laundry operation to understand its importance fully. The selection and designing of uniforms are also discussed with the outline of the advantages of staff uniforms.

This block also details different types of flower arrangements in a hotel and their importance and uses.

## Block Objectives :

- · Explain the importance of various aspects of linen control.
- · Establish the par stock of linen for a given hotel operation.
- · Describe the procedure for issuing and exchanging uniforms.
- · Explain the laundry services available in a hotel.
- · Illustrate different tasks within the  laundry process.
- · Assess the relevance of floral arrangements in enhancing the beauty    of the hotel interior.

## 1.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we have discussed the linen handling procedure in a hotel, an integral part of the housekeeping department.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · List the activities that are carried out in the linen room.
- · Explain the importance and various aspects of linen control.
- · Establish the par stock of linen for a given hotel operation
- · Explain the various aspects of linen control.

## 1.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Linen  is  considered  the  second  largest  expense  for  the  housekeeping department. Hence good maintenance, proper laundering procedure and storage would  increase  the  lifespan  of  the  linen.  Worn-out  linen  builds  a  wrong impression about the hotel standards and leads to guest dissatisfaction; thus, efficient laundry and proper linen management procedures are essential for the hotel. The option for processing the linen can be in-house or outsourced by the hotel. Effective communication and a constant check with timely inventory within

the department will help understand the amount of linen damage and control wastage.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

## Fill in the blanks :

To bring control on linen wastage within the housekeeping department, the points to consider are :

- 1. An effective within the department.
- 2. A constant

and timely

## 1.2 LAYOUT  OF  A  LINEN  ROOM  :

## The linen room should be located :

- · Next to the laundry for an on-premises setup, usually with an interconnecting door accessible to laundry.
- · It should be near the receiving area if laundry is outsourced.
- · Near the service elevator for easy transportation to other areas of the hotel.

## Layout of a LINEN ROOM

<!-- image -->

## 1.3 TYPES OF LINEN :

Linen can be classified based on where it is used :

- · On beds
- · In Bathrooms
- · In dining Areas

Bedsheets, pillowcases, blankets, and comforters need to look clean and give a new feel. Climatic condition is also an important feature to consider while choosing blankets and comforters and even to provide extra blankets in the guestroom. Mattress protectors may be woven or quilted fabric or made from felt. Felt ones are generally the least expensive but wear off quickly after repeated washings. Pillows can have cotton, synthetic fibres or hypoallergic foam filler inside them.

For bath linen, the most common fabric is terry cloth. Better quality towels have selvaged edges - means edges that are woven, not hemmed. These towels have a longer shelf-life and do not unravel quickly. Bathmats are generally heavier and have the same characteristics as other terry items.

Table linen is used for both practical purposes and to add an aesthetic look. Tablecloths, placemats or runners provide a clean eating surface, and napkins help guests stay neat while they eat. Aesthetically, crisp and fresh table linen with folded napkins adds an air of elegance to the dining room. Hotels with dining and banquet services require many tablecloths, table skirts, and silence cloths laid under the tablecloths, which helps absorb the noise. Runners and placemats can make inexpensive and attractive alternatives to tablecloths. They are available in a variety of styles and weaves.

##  Check Your Progress - 2 :

## Match the following :

- 1. Table runner
- ………. a. hypoallergic foam
- 2. Bath  Linen
- ………. b. attractive alternatives to tablecloths
- 3. Filler for the pillows
- ………. c. has edges that are woven not hemmed

## 1.4 LINEN  CARE,  REUSE  AND  REPLACEMENT  :

Linen  being  a  significant  investment,  it  is  imperative  to  minimize  its disappearance. This can happen due to wear, improper use and theft. The damage to the linen can be reduced partly by proper laundering procedure, correct usage of  chemicals,  constant  supervision  on  misuse  of  linen  for  wiping  by  the housekeeping attendant.

Linen reuse or recycling can save properties a good amount of money. Using discarded linen for rags is the most common recycling procedure. Many properties donate used linen as a charity, while discarded linen can be used as covering cloths for aprons.

## 1.5 LINEN  SELECTION  CONSIDERATION  :

All fabrics begin with raw materials spun into long strands of fibres called yarns woven or knitted into cloths. The yarns can be made from dozens of different materials that fall into three primary groups -

## a. Natural - cotton, wool, or linen :

- · Cotton is strong, absorbent, and available in a wide range.
- · Cotton is the fabric of choice for napery (table linens) and towels because of its superior absorbency.
- · When starched, it gives a crisp appearance which makes it suitable for napkin folding.
- · Mercerized cotton is more expensive, and it reduces the tendency of cotton to produce lint.
- · Egyptian cotton is considered the best quality of cotton.
- · Wool tends to felt, which means the surface fibres matt together. Hence  nowadays,  most  commonly  synthetic  fibres  are  used  for blankets.

## Linen Inventory

## House Keeping Management

- · Linen is made from the fibres of the flax plant, commonly used for napery.
- · Linen is smooth, durable, absorbent, and fast drying.

## b. Synthetics :

- · Blankets, bedspreads, and shower curtains are all made from synthetic fabrics.
- · Synthetics are less absorbent and have good thermal qualities that make them a good choice for blankets.
- · Synthetic make fabrics are stronger than natural fabrics.

## c. Blends :

- · No-iron sheets and pillow covers are generally a blend of cotton and synthetic (usually polyester) blends.
- · A blended fabric can last a more significant number of washings.

##  Check Your Progress - 3 :

Identify the type of fabric :

- 1. Reduces the tendency of cotton to produce lint:
- 2. Mix of cotton and synthetic(polyester)
- 3. Stronger than natural fabric

## 1.6 STORAGE  OF  LINEN  :

Linen should be stored in a dust, and moisture-free covered place. The linen stock should be rotated in order first-in, first-out basis. While storing linen on the shelves, the closed folded end should face outward to be easy to remove. Small linens are stacked in bundles of ten to keep count.

## 1.6.1 Linen Exchange :

- · Fresh  for  soiled  should  be  followed,  meaning  fresh  linen  should  be provided at the exact count of soiled linen. It is easier to keep a check on outgoing linen this way.
- · Set amount in this a set amount of linen is provided daily.
- · Topping is how the stock is brought up to the maximum level at the beginning of the year.
- · Requisition: A requisition slip is filled in based on which linen is provided as per the requirement.

## 1.6.2 Room Linen Exchange Procedure :

- · Soiled room linen is directly transported from floor to linen room or laundry.
- · The floor supervisor takes a physical count of the soiled linen and enters into the room linen exchange sheet.
- · The laundry or linen room attendant recount and tally the numbers.
- · Fresh linen is issued to individual areas per the days count in exchange for the received soiled linen.
- · Food and beverage
- · linen is exchanged at a given time set by the department.
- · The linen room staff checks the soiled linen received for any damages.
- · All items are counted and verified in the linen exchange register, and similarly, fresh ones are issued.

## LINEN EXCHANGE REGISTER

Date:

## 1.6.3 Restaurant Linen Exchange Procedure

- · Make sure that the food and beverage employee exchanging linen has come within the given schedule.
- · Check soiled linen received for damages.
- · Count every item, verify with the Food and Beverages Linen Exchange Form.
- · Give the same number of fresh items in exchange and enter the figures in the Linen Exchange Register
- · Handover the soiled ones in the laundry for washing

## 1.7 MAINTAINING  PAR  STOCK  :

The par number established for linen inventories is the standard stock level needed to accommodate typical housekeeping operations. One par means the total number of each type of linen required to outfit all guestrooms one time. One par is also known as a house setup. One par is not enough for quality service; hence the executive housekeeper needs to decide the total par stock required for an efficient  operation.  Three  aspects  need  to  be  considered  the  laundry  cycle, replacement linens and emergencies.

## The first aspect is the Hotel's Laundry Cycle :

- · One par linen is laundered, stored and ready to use.
- · The second par of linen was removed yesterday and will be laundered today.
- · The third par of linen will be removed from rooms today while servicing.

The second factor to consider is the replacement stock for worn out, damaged or lost linen. The general rule of thumb is to store one par of new linen as replacement stock annually.

The third factor to consider is an emergency like power failure or equipment damage. One par stock is kept as emergency stock to avoid any interruption.

## 1.8 LINEN CONTROL PROCEDURES :

Control of linen is an essential task for management. It falls into three main activities :

- 1. All employees must constantly check hygiene standards and the appearance of linen in their areas.
- 2. Timely exchange of linen between the guest floor and linen room/laundry.
- 3. Purchase details, inventories and stock taking records.

##  Inventory Control of Linens :

- · A floor par is the quantity of each type of linen required to outfit all rooms serviced from a floor linen closet.
- · Linen par of each floor should be posted on the linen cupboard
- · The linen requirement for each floor depends on the total occupancy of that day.
- · Room attendants/floor supervisor keeps a note on the total count of soiled linen that is removed from the rooms.
- · Based on the soiled linen removed, the evening crew member restocks the floor pantry with fresh linen.
- · This helps in bringing up the stock of each floor to full par.
- · Clean but damaged linen should be noted and handed over to the laundry supervisor.
- · Careful records for all discarded linen must be maintained.

##  Taking a Physical Inventory of Linens :

- · A physical inventory should be done once every month. Generally, it is at the end of the month.
- · The timely inventory helps the executive housekeeper accurately count the linen in circulation, the amount discarded or missing.
- · Linen should be carefully budget
- · ed.
- · The floor supervisor does the inventory with the help of a housekeeping attendant.
- · Each type of linen in the rooms is counted, and the total is compiled at the day's end.
- · Linen in all areas should be included in the count.
- · The linen count sheet should be filled out for every type of linen in each location.
- · After each physical inventory, the executive housekeeper should ensure that the par levels are returned to the initial levels for each linen item.

##  Check Your Progress - 4 :

## Fill in the blanks with the correct term :

- 1. A is the quantity of each type of linen required to outfit all rooms  on  a  single  floor.
- 2. is a stock maintained for damage or loss of linen.

## 1.9 POINTS  TO  CONSIDER  FOR  LINEN  PURCHASE  :

- · Estimate the quantity of linen for the purchase of linen. It should be accurate so that the items are not purchased in excess.
- · Accurate specifications must be provided when placing orders, especially with sizes.
- · Take samples of linen and test for 'dressing' that falls out from the fabric when rubbed together.
- · Also, check the samples for laundering effects like shrinkage, loss of shape, colour.
- · Storage space should be checked for large quantity orders.
- · A Purchase Index Card must be maintained for every linen item in stock.
- · A good rapport with the supplier is essential for credit facilities.
- · In case of any quality rejection, the product needs to be replaced by the supplier.

## 1.10 LET US SUM UP :

In this unit, we :

- · Identified the challenges to inventory control for linens in a housekeeping operation.
- · Understood the importance of maintaining Par Stock for linen.
- · Discussed the importance of physical inventory for linen.

- · Discuss the design of uniforms for hotel staff.
- · Establish par levels for staff uniforms in each property
- · Understand the procedure for issuing and exchanging uniforms
- · Outline the advantages of providing uniforms to the staff.

## 2.1 INTRODUCTION  :

Uniforms are made up of unique materials, colours and designs usually given  by  the  organization.  Most  hotels  have  uniformed  staff  members  for individual departments, and there are different specifications for uniform pattern, style, colour and design. The housekeeping department is the one who takes care of the regular processing of these uniforms, storing them and timely issuing of the uniforms. It is quite challenging for large hotels as there are many types, quantities and sizes.

## House Keeping Management

## 2.2 SELECTION AND  DESIGNING  OF  UNIFORMS  :

Image and Identity of the Property : Depending on the theme or desire of the hotel to build a professional or unique image about itself, it may customize the employees' uniforms.

Wear Comfort : A suitable fabric with a good fit and design makes the employees look more professional. Staff need to be active; hence the uniform should have a comfortable fabric and good fit so that it does not create any hindrance or restriction in body movement during work.

Purpose of Work : Designing for work is essential. For example, it is comfortable for a guest room attendant to have a short-sleeved uniform or kitchen staff to wear safety shoes while working. Dungarees or overalls must have several deep pockets for the maintenance employees to keep tools handy.

Appearance and Style : A uniform should be designed to look good in all sizes of people.

Climatic Conditions of the Place : Need to be considered for choosing the fabric and pattern of the uniform. If the hotel is not centrally air-conditioned and is a spread-out property, then the management needs to consider the type of fabric and the design of the uniform.

Ease of Availability of Materials : the fabric and accessories chosen for the uniform must be readily available whenever new uniforms are required.

##  Check Your Progress - 1 :

## Fill in the missing blanks :

- 1. An excellent fitted and well-designed uniform makes the employees look more
- 2. The uniform can be to give a themed look to the hotel.

## 2.3 ESTABLISHING  PAR  LEVELS  FOR  UNIFORMS  :

To make the budget for the uniforms, the executive housekeeper needs to consider the life expectancy of the garments, seasonal requirements and the laundry cycle. As a rule, the staff should be supplied with at least three sets of uniforms. Certain areas like the kitchen need to maintain more par.

## The following factors are considered :

To establish par for all types of uniforms, the executive housekeeper needs to know how many uniformed personnel work in each department, the specification of the uniform and the cleaning procedure.

To  determine  the  turnaround  time  by  the  laundry  for  processing  the uniforms. How often would the uniform need laundering?

The nature of the job will determine how often the staff would change and require a fresh set of uniforms.

## 2.4 INVENTORY  CONTROL  OF  UNIFORMS  :

- · All uniforms should be controlled and issued through the uniform room.
- · Adequate space should be there to store the uniform properly
- · It should stack as per the department so that it becomes easy to handle and becomes hassle-free during issuing
- · A proper systematic process should be there for receiving the soiled and issuing fresh ones.
- · A register is maintained department-wise when a uniform is issued to a new employee with the count of items and a proper handover when leaving the job.
- · For any repair work, a form should be filled and then handed to the tailor of the hotel for repairing.

## Calculating Par Stock quantity for Uniforms :

Depending on the cleaning schedule for uniforms - daily or alternate days, the number of pars is decided. Generally, the par required is three - one in use, the second in the uniform room, and the third in the laundry.

##  Storage of Uniforms :

- 1. Fresh uniforms are received from the laundry and stored department wise in the uniform room.
- 2. The uniform room should be aired, the humidity of the room should not be more than 20 per cent.
- 3. Generally, staff are not allowed to take uniforms outside the hotel, and they are provided with lockers to keep their uniform at the end of the shift.

##  Issuing uniforms for new employees :

- · Uniforms are issued on a specific authorization letter received from the human resource department.
- · The employee is required to sign for his or her uniform.
- · A uniform issue slip is filled and provided to the employee by the human resource department.
- · The uniform is then issued from the linen room where the department name, items issued are entered in the register, and employee signature is also taken.

##  Issuing uniforms for regular employees :

- · The fresh uniform is generally issued in exchange for a soiled one.
- · On leaving the organization, the employee needs to hand over the uniform and get a signature done on the clearance form from the head of the department.

##  Uniform Exchange Procedure :

- · Employees need to follow the timing of the uniform exchange
- · Check for any damage in the uniform
- · Issue a fresh uniform once the soiled is received

## 3.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we have discussed the processes and tasks of the laundry department in a hotel, which is an integral part of the housekeeping department.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Discuss the laundry services available in a hotel
- · Enumerate different tasks within the laundry process
- · List the essential laundry equipment.

## 3.1 INTRODUCTION  :

## House Keeping Management

clothes collected in the morning are given back the same evening. Most hotels provide valet service for the to-and-fro transfer of guest laundry.

The linen 'life' depends on the care of the linen in use and the treatment it gets at the laundry; hence the executive housekeeper should invest in quality linen.

A good laundry is, therefore, of great importance to any establishment.

Following precautions are taken :

- · Articles are handled carefully.
- · The tensile strength of the material is not impaired.
- · The white fabric is maintained white.
- · Stains are removed when requested.
- · Materials are not ruined by excessive use of bleach.
- · The work is carried out as speedily as possible.
- · A proper record keeping needs to be maintained for damage and losses.

## 3.2 TYPE  OF  LAUNDRY  SERVICES  :

## An establishment has the choice of the following laundry services :

Commercial/contract laundry : They cater to hotels on a contract basis with rate specifications for laundering different types of linen. The soiled linens are picked up from the hotel on a scheduled time and similarly delivered within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Contract laundries are an excellent option if the management decides not to set up its laundry or has a space constraint.

##  Advantages :

- · No Capital Investment.
- · Not much technical expertise is required.
- · Employee cost is saved.

##  Disadvantages :

- · Less control over the quality of the finished product.
- · There might be delays in delivery and collection.
- · Extra par stocks need to be maintained.

In-house or on-premises : When a hotel has its laundry situated within the hotel premises. It may be run by the hotel employees or sometimes managed on a contract. It is possible to train the staff, and proper care can be taken while laundering the linen to provide guest standard quality. With in-house laundry, the service is faster and less par stock is required. There is constant supervision on the process, better cost control, enhancing the life span of the linen.

##  Advantages :

- · No shortfalls or missing items.
- · Investment in extra par stock is not needed.
- · Emergency requirements can be better handled.
- · Better quality of standards can be maintained.

##  Disadvantages :

- · The initial capital investment is high.
- · Higher operational cost.

Linen hire : This  also  includes  laundry  service,  an  option  where  no investment is made in purchasing and maintaining a par stock of linen. The linen itself is rented, used and returned as per day to day requirements. Owing to the high cost of linen and its upkeep, the hiring of linen from firms offering a linen rental service has become more popular. The firms undertake to supply clean articles in good condition. Arrangements are made between the firm and the hotel regarding the amount of linen required, the frequency of deliveries, and the price to be charged. Stocktaking is still regular practice, and losses must be paid.

None of these can be automatically considered as offering the best and most economical laundry service, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.

## 3.3 PLANNING  OF  AN  OPL  (ON-PREMISES  LAUNDRY)  :

The planning of having an on-premises laundry should be decided at the initial planning stages for the facility.

The  location  of  the  laundry  must  be  strategic  enough  to  prevent  the transportation problem. It should be easily accessible from the linen room to move heavily stacked linen from one area to another. It should be located away from the guest area because of the sound and vibration of heavy equipment. The thumb rule for hotel laundry size is 7sq ft per room (not including soil storage). One cubic foot for every 3.6 kg (up to a height of 4 feet) is usually allotted for soil storage. Proper ventilation is essential for the staff to work comfortably in the laundry. The laundry equipment must be considered concerning the spacing of the laundry, the initial cost, life expectancy, maintenance and depreciation. A proper spread out of equipment with a good amount of space for the employees to work comfortably, a free space for the trolley movement, the correct sequence for the equipment placement, and storage space for keeping the chemicals. The thumb rule for labour is that one person should handle a weight of 36kg an hour.

##  The Layout of an OPL :

<!-- image -->

The layout of linen in terms of positioning machines should be in a manner where there is an easy traffic flow. While designing, attention needs to be given to the entries, exits, drainage system, columns, exhaust area and machinery access. Doors need to be large equipment to get the equipment inside the room, free movement of utility carts. Ceilings need to be high with proper sound absorption. The floor is an essential component of laundry. There should not be any low spots in the room for water accumulation. Concrete is the most suitable flooring  material.  Walls  should  be  constructed  with  moisture-resistant  and durable material. There should be 18 inches gap between two machines, and space should be given between the wall and machine. Soiled storage and sorting should take place near the washers. The finishing area for the linen should be near the storage space for more accessible transportation.

<!-- image -->

## Hotel Laundry

## House Keeping Management

<!-- image -->

## 3.5.1 Pre-Washing :

The following steps are undertaken at the pre-washing stage :

## Collecting and Sorting Soiled Linen

The guest room attendants strip the linen from beds and bath areas and put them directly into the soiled-linen bag on the room attendant's cart. Linen should never be piled on the floor where they may be walked on and soiled further or damaged. Food and beverage linen is also placed in hampers for delivery to the laundry. Stained linen should be knotted in one corner to help in sorting. Soiled linen should be sent as soon as possible to the laundry so that stains do not set in. In many hotels, soiled linen is sent to the linen room for sorting, counting and recording before being sent to the laundry. If off-site laundry service is used, the soiled linen is marked in the linen room before being transported.

## Transporting Soiled Linen to the Laundry :

Large hotels have a linen chute that runs down the entire height of the building to the laundry's soil and sort area. Soiled linen is usually transported to the laundry on linen carts or in laundry sacks in other hotels. Linen carts should be free of protrusions that could snag or tear items.

## 3.5.2 Sorting :

The soil and sort area in the laundry should be large enough to store a day's worth of laundry without slowing down other activities in the laundry. The articles are sorted out according to the following parameters:

The degree of soiling is the first check. The soiled linen is separated into categories of stained, unstained, heavily soiled, medium-soiled, and lightly soiled articles.

The articles are further sorted by the colour and fastness of the dye. They are then further sorted by fibre type.

Linen that needs repair is separated and sent to the tailor for mending before washing.

In case the article to be mended is heavily soiled, it is first washed and then mended.

Monogramming of new linen must be carried out before washing to control pilferage and help identify.

Condemned or discarded linen are sorted out and cut down before washing.

Light linen is separated. This linen, after continuous use, loses lustre and becomes worn out. They can no longer be offered to VIPs. However, being still in good condition, they may be used for houseguests or staff members staying in  the  hotel.  These  are  stocked  and  washed  separately.  These  differ  from condemned  linen  in  that  they  are  not  torn;  however,  they  are  no  longer  in 'standard' condition.

All fancy accessories and attachments such as buttons, buckles, rings and so on are removed from linen to be washed. False collars in curtains must be removed as well.

All pockets are emptied, and all folds checked.

## 3.5.3 Weighing and Loading :

The articles, once sorted, are weighed while dry. This is necessary as each washing machine has specific loading instructions that have to be followed. Weighing is also helpful in measuring the productivity of the laundry workers. A modular system of loading is the simplest.

Each type of linen article has a known weight, so these are counted into piles until the appropriate total weight is reached. For instance, if a bedsheet weighs 500g and the capacity of each compartment of the washing machine is 25 kg, then 50 sheets are counted out for each compartment. Alternatively, bundles of linen can be physically weighed before putting them into compartments.

## 3.5.4 Washing :

The following parameters indicate the proper washing program :

Heavily soiled linen requires more time than lightly soiled linen.

The rate at which soil is removed is not constant either and must be considered.

Generally, the laundry workers should choose the lowest possible temperature to do the job effectively to save energy. However, some detergents and chemicals work correctly only in hot water, and some soils require higher temperatures.

Wash cycles: Several shorter washes are better than one long one. More soil can be removed with freshly made up suds and clean water than with one solution in which the soil remains in suspension and has a chance to re-soil the linen during the wash.

Rinsing: Done using hot and cold water, usually recovered and recycled from earlier steps during the last rinse to save water. Extraction removes at least 50 per cent of the water used in the rinsing process.

## 3.5.5 Finishing :

## This stage in the laundry cycle consists of the following processes :

Drying : Items that are dried after hydro-extraction generally include towels, washcloths, and some no-iron linen. Drying items and temperatures vary considerably for different types of linen. In every laundry cycle, however, drying

## Hotel Laundry

## House Keeping Management

should be followed by a cool-down period to prevent the hotline from being damaged or wrinkled by rapid cooling and handling. After drying, linen should be immediately removed for folding, and if folding is delayed, wrinkles will set in.

Ironing : Sheets, pillowcases, tablecloths, and napkins go directly into flatwork irons. Towels do not need ironing. They should emerge from the tumbledryer in a soft and fluffy state, after which they may be folded by hand or machine. Guest clothing and uniforms are finished on various steam presses.

Folding : This can be done by hand or by machine. Whatever the case, washing and drying items faster than they can be folded leads to unnecessary wrinkling and re-sorting being required. Folding personnel must also inspect the linen, putting aside those to be laundered again and rejecting stained, torn and otherwise unsuitable items. Folding should be done well away from the stored linen area to avoid re-sorting clean laundry. This step should also be considered a quality-control step.

Storing : After folding, the items are post-sorted and stacked. Post-sorting separates any odd linen types and sizes in the batch that were missed in the presorting step. There should be enough storage room for at least one part of the linen. Finished items should be allowed to 'rest' on shelves for 24 hours after laundering because many types of linen get damaged more easily after washing. Once the linens are on the shelves, yellowing and fading can be spotted easily.

Transferring : Fresh, laundered linen is usually transferred to their areas of use by carts.

## 3.6 STAIN  REMOVAL  :

A stain is a spot or localized discolouration left on fabric by reacting with or absorbing a foreign substance. Stain removal or spot cleaning is a skill that demands special attention, specific techniques and long experience. The two main factors to be borne in mind while attempting to remove a stain are:

- · The composition and colour of the fabric
- · The nature and age of the stain

## Follow the steps given below for removing stains from fabric :

- 1. Identify the stain.
- 2. Classify the stain.
- 3. Select the reagents to be used.
- 4. Select the procedure to be used.
- 5. Proceed systematically to remove the stain.

All  stains  should,  as  far  as  possible,  be  removed  while  still  fresh.  If immediate treatment of the stain is not possible, it must be removed before the garment is washed. Known stains should be treated with specific reagents meant for their removal. If the nature of the stain is unknown, it should be treated first by the least harmful method, passing on from one process to the next.

## 3.7 DRY  CLEANING  :

This  is  the  cleaning  of  fabrics  in  a  substantially  non-aqueous  liquid medium. Dry-cleaning removes oils and many water-soluble and some insoluble materials with the help of detergents and various other agents. The term 'drycleaning' is misleading. It suggests that the cleaning is done using dry materials only, whereas the fact is that in addition to dry powders, liquids such as petrol, benzene and so on are also used. Unlike laundering, dry-cleaning does not cause swelling of the fibres and does not lead to shrinkage, wrinkles and bleeding of colours. Dry-cleaning is thus a safe method for cleaning delicate textiles. It was earlier known as 'French cleans' or 'chemical cleaning' and is based on the principle that most of the dirt or soiling matter is held to the fabric by grease. When this grease is removed, the dirt is removed along with it.

## 3.8 VALET  SERVICE  :

Valet service means that the hotel will take care of guest laundry needs.

<!-- image -->

## House Keeping Management

Offering valet service requires the housekeeping department to set up its own laundry business. It must have the following :

- · Set times for laundry pickup and delivery.
- · Determine how laundry would be delivered to guestrooms.
- · Figure bills to be attached to clean laundry.
- · Determine the hotel liability policy under state and local laws.
- · Handle lost and damaged items.
- · Fill in guest comments and complaints.

Valet staff will need their workspace for sorting, tagging, washing, drying and finishing. Some hotels have a valet extension number that guests can call to get the laundry pickup service. Some valet services include minor mending jobs such as sewing on a button. When laundry is processed, they are nicely packed, ticketed with a bill, and delivered to the guestroom.

## 3.9 LET US SUM UP :

In this unit, we :

- · Discussed the laundry services available in a hotel.
- · Listed the types of equipment used in the laundry.
- · Explained different tasks within the laundry process.
- · Discussed the laundry valet service procedure.

## 4.0 LEARNING OBJECTIVES :

In this unit, we have discussed the processes and tasks of the laundry department in a hotel, which is an integral part of the housekeeping department.

## After working through this unit, you should be able to :

- · Understand the importance of flower arrangement to enhance the beauty of the hotel
- · Enumerate the basic ingredients that are required
- · List the essential laundry equipment.

## 3.1 INTRODUCTION  :

<!-- image -->

Flower arrangement is the art of organizing plant materials like flowers, foliage, twigs, etc., to achieve harmony of form, colour, and texture, adding

beauty to the surroundings. It is essentially a decorative piece and generally creates an attractive ambience. An arrangement can be composed of only flowers and foliage, sometimes combined with fruits, balloons, chocolates, candles etc. Arrangements are generally put up in different areas of the hotel like lobbies, restaurants, guestrooms, function halls and other guest areas. Floral arrangements need not be reserved only for parties or special occasions as guests appreciate flowers for the freshness they bring to the surroundings; hence, they can be used regularly depending on the season and theme.

## 4.2 FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS IN HOTELS :

In  hotels,  flowers  are  used  extensively.  There  is  a  display  of  floral arrangements in different sizes and shapes depending on the space and availability of flowers.

## Flower arrangements are made in the hotels for the following :

- · Creates ambience and décor
- · As Amenities for VIP guests
- · Personalized service
- · To fit empty unattractive spaces- acts as a camouflage
- · Special functions or occasions

Housekeeping is responsible for all flower arrangements and their placement in hotels. Large hotels have a horticulturist who looks after the entire gardening and a florist who makes the floral arrangements per the day's requirement under the  housekeeping  department's  supervision.  Some  hotels  also  outsource  this service, a contract based on which flowers and arrangements are brought in and taken away as per the agreement.

Unless a contractor provides the flower arrangements, the housekeeping department needs to have a flower room equipped with all necessities for making up arrangements, including a water supply in that area with containers, buckets, vases, scissors, etc.

Flower Arrangement

House Keeping Management

To put up an excellent floral arrangement requires a lot of creativity using different plant materials and props.

The materials needed to make the arrangements are :

Mechanics : These are used to place the flowers, foliage, and stems in place within the container. They are always hidden and should not be visible. The basic mechanics are :

<!-- image -->

Oasis (floral foam)

<!-- image -->

Pin holders (kenzan)Chicken wire

<!-- image -->

Equipment  : These  tools  and  other  aids  are  used  to  ensure  a  good arrangement with the plant materials. The equipment needed is a bucket, scissors, knife and watering device.

Containers : These are the receptacles that hold the floral arrangement, theme and simplicity that should be kept in mind while choosing the design of the container.

Bases : Sometimes, these are used underneath the container to protect the surface and add to the beauty of the display.

Support : This refers to the structure on which the container stands. The usual supports are tables, sideboards, alcoves and shelves.

Plant Material : This consist of three parts the line material which gives the main structure to design, the second one is the focal point, the centre part of the arrangement in which cluster of flowers are put up, and lastly it is the fillers which are used to cover the mechanics and edges of the container.

Accessories : These are non-plant materials included or placed alongside the arrangement. They enhance the beauty of the arrangement.

##  Guidelines for buying cut flowers :

While buying flowers in a hotel, the buying person must know where and how to buy the cut flowers.

Flowers are a highly perishable commodity, and if the vendors themselves have not kept them in good condition, they will not last long. Hence exotic

flowers are expensive, and it is best to buy them from a wholesale market, where one can get a lot of variety at a reasonable price.

While buying, look at the flower bucket first, they should be placed out of direct sunlight, and the water should be clean and not smelly. The foliage should be firm, and the cut ends adequately immersed in water. Choose blooms at the just-open stage and not the full-blown stage for a long-lasting display. Although it seems ripe for display, the problem with the full-bloom stage is that all the flowers are fully open, so the display will be short-lived.

##  Preparation for the arrangement :

The guidelines to follow to make the arrangement look beautiful and fresh for long are :

- · Plant stems should be cut at a slant using sharp scissors or a knife
- · Wrap the flowers in newspaper till the neck of the flowers
- · To revive wilting flowers, snip off half an inch of the stem underwater and plunge in a deep container of water, removing the dead ones.
- · Remove all the leaves from the stems of flowers that have shorter lives.
- · Ensure enough water for woody stems by paring 2 inches of the ends and making a cross-shaped cut in the end.

##  Aftercare for the arrangement :

- · Never place a fresh flower arrangement underneath a fan or expose it to direct sunlight.
- · Never place flower arrangement near a bowl of apples, pears, and plums. They give out ethylene gas while ripening, which causes wilting of flowers.
- · Never use chilled water.
- · Use a clean container to avoid premature fouling and bacterial growth.

##  Check Your Progress - 2 :

Give reasons for the following :

- 1. Should use a clean container to keep flowers because :

## 4.4 DESIGNING A FLOWER ARRANGEMENT :

Decorating with flowers is a creative and stimulating art, which often carries a message or theme and expresses the mood or emotions of the arranger. Blending the eight features of good design helps in creating beautiful flower arrangements.

## Thus following things focus on the designing of the flower arrangements.

Style : Based on the angle from which they are seen, the style could be an all-around arrangement or a facing arrangement. The style could be based on the amount of space present in the arrangement; it could be a mass, line, or miscellaneous  style.  Also,  it  could  be  a  foliage  arrangement  or  dry  flower arrangement  based  on  the  plant  material  used.  Based  on  the  effect  of  the arrangement,  it  could  be  formal,  semi-formal,  informal  or  modern/abstract/ freestyle.

Proportion : Good proportion means the size of each element-container, plant material, base and accessories- should result in a pleasing, harmonious

## Flower Arrangement

## House Keeping Management

appearance. For the arrangement, everything should be in scale. The arrangement may have good style and proportion, but if the background or setting in which it  has  been  placed  is  unsuitable,  it  may  lose  its  charm,  e.g.,  an  abstract arrangement would look out of place in a small cottage setting. Also, a petite arrangement in a large, lofty hall can look pathetic, thus dining table arrangements that obstruct conversation across the table and hall arrangements that block free passage are unsuitable. The texture of the plant material comes in various forms; glossy, velvety, dull, prickly, etc., hence it is a skill to merge this texture with the surrounding arrangement, whether it be the lighting, vase, or container etc. Physical as well as visual balance, needs to be considered. If it is too asymmetrical, then there is a danger that the whole arrangement may fall. The mechanics must always be securely fixed, and the container should always be heavy enough to support the plant material. Sand and gravel can be used to achieve this. The balance from top to bottom also must be considered. Balance with a container, the colour of flowers plays a vital role.

Rhythm or Movement : This denotes how your eyes move around when one is observing the flower arrangement. This develops various interesting things while hiding some part of the stems, contrast in the shapes of foliage or colours of the flowers, placing the flowers at different stages, even an irregular line or various sized blooms can obscure the beauty of the arrangement.

Colour : In monochromatic colour style- various tints and shades of a single hue are used. Monotonous colours should be avoided; there should be various shapes, sizes, and textures to avoid monotony. In Analogues- two, three or four hues next to each other on a colour wheel are used. The colours used should not occur in equal amounts-one should not be dominant. Whereas in Contrasting/complimentary type- the colours directly across each other on the colour wheel are used, e.g., blue iris with orange gerbera. Contrasting schemes are always lively, but they should not be over-bright. In Polychromatic/rainbow/ scattered - colours from all parts of the colour wheel are used here. If carefully arranged for a harmonious effect through other elements, this can be pleasing, especially in summers. If not, the outcome may be too bright or too spotty.

Emphasis/dominance : This involves having one or more areas in the arrangement to which the eye is drawn and on which it rests for a short time. This point is known as the 'focal point' or centre of interest.

##  Features of good flower arrangement are :

- · Focus on emphasis
- · An established style
- · Elements in proportion
- · A suitable background
- · Variety of texture
- · Arrangement in balance
- · Proper use of colour

##  Check Your Progress - 3 :

- · Arranging  flowers  in  a  circular design adds a pleasing element.
- · It is satisfying to the viewer's eye.
- · This type of arrangement is laid on conference tables or buffet tables.

## Triangular Arrangement :

- · It is the most common arrangement of  flowers  used  in  personal  and professional functions.
- · Firstly, height and width are fixed with  flowers,  and  then  the  focal point is established.
- · It is made in a triangle shape and looks very attractive.
- · They are placed on the buffet table or in the side station.

## Crescent Design :

- · The  crescent  is  asymmetrical  and informal.
- · It  requires  a  lot  of  skill  and experience.
- · This  type  of  arrangement  is  very eye-catching.
- · It is kept in the lobby of the hotel.
- · It is used as a focal point to catch the  attention  of  the  guest.

## Hogarth Design :

- · This is a very graceful arrangement style, and it is easier to make when curved branches are used.
- · Once the 'S' shape is made, flowers are filled at the centre.

The Japanese give great emphasis on the art of flower arrangement. People in Japan use flowers to symbolize seasons or particular occasions. In all their arrangements, a single principle is followed, and the most striking characteristic is that they give the impression of naturally growing plants.

Ikebana means 'making flowers alive' in Japanese. In all such arrangements, Heaven, Man, Earth is represented using three main branches. Shin, the main spray, is the highest and symbolizes heaven; it ends on the central axis of the vase. This stem should be 1½ - 2½ times the height of the container. See, the second-highest stem represents man. It provides width to the arrangement and is about three-fourths the height of the tallest spray. This stem forms an angle of about 45 degrees with the rim of the container. The lowest spray denotes the earth. This branch is about half as tall as the one signifying man and extends very little beyond the diameter of the container, forming an angle of about 115 degrees with the rim of the container. It is placed opposite the branch signifying man and is used to balance the arrangement.

The Japanese use tall vases as well as low bowls. Tall vases are usually made of bamboo, bronze or pottery. Sometimes the bamboo ones are painted with black lacquer. Low bowls are made of bronze and pottery. For holding flowers, metal holders are used in vases and bowls.

Another important aspect of their arrangements is that they always use an odd number of flowers, as they believe that odd numbers are lucky and more aesthetic. Thus in all arrangements, three, five or seven flower sprays are used.

When a flat or low container is used, it is called a Moribana style. Moribana is an informal arrangement in a shallow container in which a pin-holder is used as mechanics. When a tall vase without a pin-holder is used, the arrangement is in the Hikae style. A formal arrangement called the Seika style has strict rules governing the lengths and angles of the stems. It is a triangular arrangement and usually stiff so that all stems arise from a single point.

A floating arrangement is called Ukibana, and a basket arrangement is Morimano. Another classical arrangement in a tall cylindrical vase with a flowing and natural effect is called Nagerie.

## 4.6 PLACING  OF  FLOWER  ARRANGEMENT  :

After  creating  a  good  flower  arrangement,  its  placement  should  be meaningful, and otherwise, it may lose its charm. Well, arrangements can be made at the following levels.

- · Eye-level:  These  can  be  prominently  seen.  Television  tops,  alcoves, pedestals and so on may be used. Flower arrangements are typically placed at heights from 18 inches to 4 feet, depending on whether viewers are likely to be seated or standing.
- · High level: For anything placed well above eye level, the flowers used must belong. It can also be suspended from the ceiling.
- · Low level: Flowers and vases must be large and decorative. Floating arrangements look better when placed low.

## BLOCK SUMMARY

In this block, we have introduced the term linen as used in different areas of the hotel. Linen has been classified in different categories as per their usage and size. The maintenance and proper handling of linen are essential. Hence, it is a responsibility for the housekeeper to set standards and keep a constant check on the linen in circulation. The housekeeping department does a monthly physical inventory to maintain a proper count. A wide variety of uniforms are found in hotels specific to different departments. Many companies reflect the culture of the hotel's location, and they design uniforms to reflect ethnic wear. Thus, ethnic uniforms give a traditional touch in their service when they interact with the guest. Employee uniforms may vary by department but should convey a common theme within the hotel.

Laundry operations are essential aspects of housekeeping, depending on whether the hotel has an On-Premises Laundry (OPL) or a contracted laundry. This block describes the planning and layout of an OPL for hotels, including various types of equipment found there. Each stage of the laundry cycle has been discussed to understand the whole functioning of the laundry. Dealing with guest laundry is also an important section of the hotel laundry. The last block unit explains  the  floral  arrangement  done  by  the  housekeeping  department,  even though this may sometimes be outsourced. A section on key ingredients for a flower  arrangement  is  detailed,  including  the  equipment  and  its  mechanics. Guidelines on handling flowers and their care are also described.
