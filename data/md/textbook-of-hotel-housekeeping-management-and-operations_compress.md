## THE FUTURE GUEST

## Introduction

The traveller has changed like everything else around us. The world has never been the same with the advent of cyber space. People have crossed boundaries in the comforts of their homes at the

<!-- image -->

click of a button. This has made them knowledgeable and adventurous. Political boundaries have broken down for the communities to survive in global economies. The breakdown of the Soviet Union into a number of new states; the mass emigration into the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; the emergence of India and China as new economic superpowers; and the movement of people to the Middle East for new job opportunities, make hard currencies, cultures, cuisines and customs more accessible to people. Technology has made both travel and communication quicker and easier. While air travel is fast and convenient, the web allows us to correspond anytime with anyone in the world. The housekeeping professional, as a consequence, has been presented with new challenges in the midst of these changes. The new

housekeeping professional needs to be aware and sensitive to the changes in attitudes of the guests who come to their hotel.

## Needs of Guests

Woman Power: Women have entered all the possible male bastions  of  professions  from  airline  pilots  to  corporate executives. While balancing their home and career, they now represent a substantial part of travelling public and need special attention to their specific needs. They expect hair dryers, ironing facilities, extra security features, privacy etc. in their rooms. Eating and drinking alone in public bars and

<!-- image -->

restaurants may not be a common custom in many cultures and therefore, women require efficient room service with menus that suit the diet conscious. Many expect an array of television channels to keep abreast with their popular soap operas on television and satellite communication to keep in touch with their homes.

## Introduction

2

Business Wealth: The  buzzword  nowadays  is  privatisation.  Large dinosaurian public undertakings are forced to privatise. Governments can no longer manage and fund these behemoths. Private enterprise has reached horizons never imagined before. Worldwide investments and access to big capital funds have encouraged big businesses. Giants like the aerospace industry, computer industry, courier services and credit cards have overtaken oil, automobiles or shipping industries. Individuals too have amassed incredible wealth. Software professionals have become millionaires overnight, by creating just one unique software programme.

<!-- image -->

The result of this wealth is that business executives and entrepreneurs expect high quality rooms and business services to make an impression of their financial strength on their clients. They expect  well-equipped  business  centres  in  the  hotel  and  facilities  such  as  secretarial  services, videoconferencing, and telecommunication services as never before. Business entertainment is part of business relations and hotels that provide an array of dining experiences and entertainment, have an advantage. Entertainment would include once in a lifetime experiences with hit stars and actors. In the room they expect facilities for easy worldwide communications and unobtrusive housekeeping services to keep their rooms clean and sanitised.

Emotional Experiences: Guests have become adventurous. They want total experiences that will trigger emotions. A perfect experience is one that will appeal to all the senses of sight, hearing,

<!-- image -->

touch, smell and taste. The eyes would like to see unique costumes, lighting, evidence of cleanliness and sanitation, aesthetic room presentations and décor. Guests want their hotel experience to touch their egos, creative tastes, need for adventure and mostly, their heart. They like to hear silence and touch the softness of bed and bath linen just as much as they want to smell freshness of the room. They may touch the underside of sinks or chest of drawers to ascertain whether there is dust or not. The way the housekeeping staff give the service, contributes largely to the touching experience sought

by the guest. They expect staff to anticipate their needs and respond efficiently to them. Guests today are very demanding and will patronize hotels that recognize their special ways.

Time-conscious: The new guest is time-conscious in a fast-paced world. They are willing to

perform tasks themselves to cut time. Many are quite willing to go to the floor pantry for their needs for ice and cold snacks. They are willing to prepare their own morning tea or coffee in their rooms rather than depend on  a  slow-paced  room  service.  Guests  want  speedy  responses  to  their demands of additional blankets or cleaning services to move on with their fast-paced lives. Guests will want immediacy and will not tolerate delays in what they consider fair time. They will be intolerant to slow and inefficient service even if the hotel property is physically attractive.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Health-conscious: Guests are working hard at keeping fit and healthy. New research has made people aware of healthy living. Television has promoted that perfect figure and many expect to have health clubs and gyms in their premises. Many prefer to have a quick swim as the easiest exercise and those properties with swimming pools have an advantage. They are also nutritionally conscious. Health foods have crept into many menu offers designed by qualified dieticians. Health food is an essential requirement in most menus whether it is the T.V. menu or the gourmet restaurant menu. Food preferences extend to vegetarian and fat free dishes. Some want saltless food while others want cholesterolfree preparations. In the room they need the integrity of a non-smoking room or the sanitisation of drinking glasses or toilet bowls. Many may inspect their bed sheets for stains before sleeping

in them or smell their pillow for freshness before laying their heads on them.

Value-addition: This refers to the extras given for a particular price. For example, business executives may expect a free limousine service from the airport to the hotel, free business lounge services, free newspapers and even a free breakfast for the price they are paying for a hotel room. Women may want free admission to the sauna and Turkish baths. Families may want free babysitting services while on their vacations. In the room, they may want extra pillows or blankets, bathrobes and bath slippers and vanity supplies like shampoos, moisturizers, shaving creams and razors. Most quality hotels provide these in the room price itself.

Information: Curiosity has spurred guests to travel, made easy by quicker transportation and

economy holiday  packages.  They  are  exposed  to  international cultures and service styles and are extremely knowledgeable. Guests do expect the high and authentic standards of service and have no patience for fakes. They want information of the hotel facilities at their fingertips without having to ask anyone. They want access to their  room  bills  on  their  TV  sets  to  monitor  their  budgets  and expenditures.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

D-I-Y competent: Guests are willing to do things themselves, (D-I-Y stands for Doit-yourself).  While  the  western  person  is  normally  manually  competent,  the  vast migration of oriental people to the west, where domestic help is not available, has forced  them  to  learn  to  help  themselves.  Rooms  are  now  fitted  with  mini-bars, microwave ovens and tea/coffee stations. Floor foyers or pantries have shoepolishing machines, vending machines for ice, hot and cold snacks. One of the benefits of selfhelp is that it reduces time for the guest on a fast track.

Techno-savvy: In  addition  to  D-I-Y  competency,  guests  are comfortable in using the web and would like to take control of their living experience over the web and via phone. They want to make

their room reservations from the comfort of their homes and expect it to be honored when they reach the hotel. They want to place their own wakeup calls in automated systems or have access to their bills in the room television monitor.

<!-- image -->

4

Hygiene-conscious: Guests are very particular about hygiene, particularly in taking a note of how their rooms are prepared and those that serve them. They will  not  tolerate  soiled  uniforms,  bed  linen,  room  clothes  hangers, bathroom facilities  and  drinking  water.  They  are  willing  to  sue  hotels  for unhygienic conditions. Most governments give importance to healthy and hygienic conditions in hotel service areas. Litigations on this count have been expensive and have also led to bad publicity.

Language Savvy: While English is still the popular language in the global economy, hotels with multi-lingual housekeeping staff will be able to attract and deal with multinational clientele. While French and German were the common alternate international languages before, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Hindi and Japanese have now become necessary in the new business communities.

Point Casting: The term relates to specialization in a very narrow field. Guests will patronize hotels, which have achieved consistent excellence and authority in a narrow field. This has created

<!-- image -->

business hotels, convention hotels, casino hotels, group hotels, etc. each a specialist in providing that client segment for their particular needs. Business hotels will provide, for instance, business centres with meeting rooms, secretarial services, office processing equipment and worldwide telecommunication facilities. Rooms will be equipped with writing desks, telecommunication facilities, internet connections etc. Group hotels may provide group check-ins with minimum delay,

buffets, coach services, doctor services, handicapped facilities and multi-lingual staff for the demands of a group. Housekeeping staff must be aware of the market segment the hotel has positioned itself and serves e.g. casino, resort, business, convention, etc. segments

## Summary

Cyberspace  and  information  technology  have  changed  our  lives  and  also  the  guest.  The housekeeping professional has to rise to the challenges of the new guest, just as their hotels are upgrading their facilities to meet these new challenges. Future guests will demand new competencies from those that serve them; otherwise they will benefit the business of some other hotel by choosing from the  endless  options  available  to  them.  So  the  housekeeping  professional  now  must  be empathetic to the demands of the new guest.

## THE NEW HOUSEKEEPING PROFESSIONAL

## Introduction

Cyberspace has forced the world to see things in different ways. It has shrunk the world and we are now witnessing true globalisation. What does globalisation mean? It means that people have access

to products and services worldwide, at the click of a button. We are in the third wave of Alvin Toffler, the futurist. He believes that society moved from a traditional agrarian society to an industrial one, created by the industrial revolution. The industrial cycle has now paved the way to a service society, where services, of any kind, are available to society, thanks to the web. The customer is the centrepiece of the service age. The key mission of cyberspace is to create value for the customer. Its credo is to offer the best and cheapest products and services from anywhere in the world. The four pillars on which this cyberspacedominatedage of globalisation stands are: 1) English as the primary language; 2) most transactions in future to be done by Visa/Master cards; 3) the US Dollar as the common currency, though seriously challenged in future by economic blocs like the European Common Market with the

<!-- image -->

Euro; possibly the Asean currency promoted by the Asian economic bloc with the exception of Japan, India and China who stand apart with powerful economies; the Middle East as an economic bloc with a common currency like the Dinar, and 4) An increase in the free trade between nations with the breaking down of political and trade barriers. Organisation structures have changed to accommodate these changes. The traditional hierarchical structure, as given below, is no longer valid.

<!-- image -->

## Structure of an Organisation

The changes in the new millennium have dismantled bureaucratic structures and redefined them. The frontline service personnel, like front office agents, restaurant servers, counter sales persons or room attendants and hosts are now the business makers. This change has come from the belief that it is they who create guest experiences. The frontline has been empowered with decision-

6

making authority, which their erstwhile supervisors had. The corporate management and specialists will now support the frontline staff to create effective guest experiences. Policies and procedures have been redrawn to meet the new structures and challenges. The new structure will, therefore, look like this:

<!-- image -->

Organisation Structures have gone flatter with technology taking over the processing work. The erstwhile middle management will be wiped out. Front-line staff shall now make tactical decisions at the operational level.

We have seen how the new customer responds to global changes in the section,  The Future Guest .  Hotel management students and professionals will need to engineer and re-engineer themselves too, to meet these dramatic changes.

Let us see how roles and competencies of front line staff will change in future:

## Frontline Staff

Relational: They will be good at customer relations with strong interpersonal skills. Frontline personnel will make people interaction a joyful art. They will be adept at remembering faces and names and be able to remember the special needs of regular guests. They shall keep elaborate guest history records to respond to guest special needs in the past and respond to them. Frontline staff will be skilled in handling difficult guests and know exactly what to do in emergency situations.

Multilingual: Frontline personnel will be strong in the English language. As it will still be a foreign language to many nationalities, frontline staff will also develop skills in other languages. French

<!-- image -->

and German languages were credible alternatives to English in  the  past.  The  new  world  now  requires  proficiency  in Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi and Spanish. Frontline  teams  will  be  assembled  to  provide  a  range  of language  options  to  international  clientele.  Up-country establishments will further need skills in local dialects. With multi-lingual skills, hotel professionals will greatly enhance their job opportunities globally.

Service-Oriented: The future frontline staff will genuinely enjoy serving people and develop it into an art. They would acquire all the technical, interpersonal, and management skills to give an excellent guest experience. They will use technology to assist them in the process. Guest Histories on common servers will help fine-tune their awareness of needs and preferences of the guests. Computers will help in delivering a mere speedy service to an ever impatient guest on a fast track.

<!-- image -->

Creative Problem-solvers: Frontline staff will be skilled in problemsolving and decision-making. Managements will empower them to make on-the- spot decisions to enhance the guest experience. For example, a room attendant may be able to provide a regular guest with an additional vanity set if requested or a second or third service as demanded. Such decisions were earlier only permitted by the supervisor.

Action-oriented: Frontline staff of the future will support promises with actions. If a room attendant promises the front office agent a room cleared

in twenty minutes, for a guest waiting to check in, she will be obliged to honor his promise within that time frame. If the floor supervisor promises to provide a babysitter to a guest by an allotted time in the evening, the promise has to be fulfilled to maintain quality service.

Techno-savvy: Frontline personnel of the future will be comfortable with fast changing technologies and environments that affect them. Front office software like the Fidelio already exists. New recruits from hotel  schools  will  come  with  skills  in  such  softwares.  Training programmes for the housekeeping personnel will focus on adapting them to new changes in procedures and technologies. A room attendant will be able to deal with multiple tasks from changing fused bulbs in rooms to being able to resolve minor television problems.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Commission-oriented: Service staff will prefer to work on commissions as part of their compensation packages. They have the confidence to generate substantial secondary income through commissions and bonuses. Hotels will provide a salary to cover the cost of living together with incentive packages to motivate direct revenue generating personnel to bring in new customers or generate  additional  revenues  from  regular  clients  by  up-selling.  Among housekeeping  personnel,  many  housekeepers  may  be  having  their  own database of regular clients to whom they provide personalised service. Guests prefer to move their business to hotels who hire those professionals who already know their lifestyle and preferences rather than having to cultivate their relationships once again with a new housekeeping

staff. Service staff can get commissions for their repeat guests or they can get bonuses for the good feedback given by the guests and the number of times they return to the hotel.

Multi-skilled: Service professionals will have management skills, technological skills, customer skills and reporting skills. This makes the erstwhile housekeeper a knowledge worker. The titles will also change to accommodate their new roles such as Hosts, Floor Relationship Executives, Customer Service Hostesses, etc.  Multi-skilling  is  a  strategy  to  reduce  staff,  pay  better  wages  to  those

remaining, and have the flexibility to deploy them where there is a need. Housekeepers will learn to prepare guest rooms, take responsibilities in public areas, deal with laundry tasks, manage the control desk operations or manage floral decoration and landscaping. Housemen may double up as bellboys at resort properties or even the housekeeper man at the reception in smaller hotels.

Physical Fitness: Frontline staff will be physically fit. They will have to be energetic to  work  actively  and  enthusiastically  for  long  hours  on  their  feet.  The  new housekeeping professional will enroll into a gym and make daily exercise a way of

<!-- image -->

life. They will be diet conscious and realise that their appearance is their fortune and that hotels and guests expect the smartest frontline staff.

<!-- image -->

Grooming: While hotels have traditionally given importance to grooming as part of the hotel culture, frontline personnel will take their own initiatives to consult beauty consultants to advise the best way they can present themselves. The new frontline professional will visit salons regularly to be more presentable. Mens salons have also opened to give that perfect manicure and hair cut to their clients.

## Backline Specialists

Specialists  like  the  Facility  Planners,  Trainers,  Revenue  Managers, Reservation  Agents,  Animators,  Software  Programmers  and Conference Planners, etc. will pointcast themselves. They will enrich the frontline performance with their expertise. They would either be stand-alone specialists or members of project teams who address special problems  and  innovations.  Specialists  would  perhaps  create  new packages to stimulate room sales or websites to bring the hotel into homes and offices.  Housekeepers  are  moving  towards  becoming internal consultants to hotel complexes that have large leasing operations for various businesses such as restaurants, beauty salons, shop owners, entertainment centres, etc.

<!-- image -->

Mastery in Functional Area: The specialists will believe in continuous learning as a way of life to bring the best practices available in their field of mastery. They would not only use their high level of education and experience to give organisations a leading edge but also research and find ways to beat competition with new models of performance. They will act as consultants to the organisation rather than just paid employees.

<!-- image -->

Creative in Applications: Specialists would not be bureaucratic and rigid in their approach. Their skills would be to find solutions to existing problems and new models to enhance guest experience. This requires innovation, research, cross-modification skills and candour. Above all, they must be thoroughly aware of systems and procedures.

Technical Orientation: Service personnel would be comfortable with technology  and  may  guide  software  developers  in  developing  new

## Introduction

applications for their sphere of operations. They will become active members of development teams.

Loyalty to their Profession: Backline specialists will believe in their profession and will commit themselves to excellence. They will benchmark themselves with other noted professionals and organisations in the field, so as to introduce best practices into the organisation.

Ability to work in various teams: Problems will be solved in teams that need a variety of specialist input. For example, new guest history software will require IT specialists, guest relations

executive, lobby manager, front office manager, front desk agents, order-takers, housekeepers, telephone operators, etc. They will have to work in teams each being a resource to the project. This type of working will require interpersonal skills,  negotiation  skills,  problem-solving  skills,  listening  skills,  assertion  and knowledge.

Focus  on  Continuing  Education: Specialists  will  invest  in  their  selfdevelopment from their own pockets. Substantial part of their income will be in continuing education. Obsolescence is the greatest fear of the new millennium. They will have to continue learning to keep up to the latest developments.

<!-- image -->

## Corporate Management

Corporate Management will no longer act as policemen but facilitators. The only control they will have is strategic control and financial control. They shall be responsible for long-term planning,

<!-- image -->

legal affairs, finance and development. They will generate wealth creatively through investments, mergers and acquisitions, so as to expand and give their employees career growth. They shall design progressive policies and procedures to make the frontline staff effective and productive.

The corporate will not be involved in marketing, production, purchasing  and  industrial  relations.  This  will  be  left  to  unit management. The corporate approach will be to convert each revenue outlet into a strategic business unit. This means that each restaurant will have its own balance sheet and profit and

loss statement. The unit head will be held responsible for the unit performance and be empowered to make independent decisions with the allocated resources within broad corporate policies.

The challenges that the corporate will have in dealing with knowledge workers are:

- l Developing an effective Performance Management system.
- l Developing a reward and recognition system.
- l Career plans for specialists.
- l Creating a unified vision and creating pride in it.
- l Integrating project teams with frontline workers.
- l Defining the role of project leaders and unit heads.
- l Continuous improvement of the human capital.
- l Acquiring and retaining talent.

## 10

## Summary

Change or move out will be the new mantra . Frontline professionals must keep abreast with new developments. They cannot have the luxury of waiting for the organisation to invest in their learning. They must invest in new knowledge from their own resources. One must not forget that

each generation that passes out of hotel schools comes equipped with the  latest  knowledge.  They  are  potential  replacements  to  obsolete thought and technology. Continuous education will be necessary for survival in the industry. Hotels will always give priority to youth in their ranks to keep the workforce young, energetic, creative, enthusiastic, and up-to-date. Employees who cross thirty five will have to seriously review  their  career  plans  to  become  specialists  or  generalists  with leadership skills. A great part of leadership is to possess entrepreneurial skills to look at operations as a business. Modern business requires the effective allocation of resources, motivation of frontline staff and creation of customer satisfaction.

## HOUSEKEEPING AND ITS CAREERS

## Introduction

Before we deal with the careers in housekeeping, we must know what housekeeping is. We often wonder how all the premises like offices, conference centres, malls, movie theatres, etc. are kept organised,  clean  and  attractive.  This  is  the  work  of  a  silent  workforce  called  housekeeping. Housekeeping normally has a large brigade wherever they are deployed. They are certainly the largest workforce in hotels. This is because they are responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance and aesthetic upkeep of the entire premises, both externally and internally. We shall restrict ourselves to the housekeeping department in a hotel.

## What is Housekeeping?

The housekeeping department in a hotel is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance and aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. Just as the nomenclature signifies, the role of housekeeping is to keep a clean, comfortable and a safe house. It is an extension of basic housekeeping enhanced into commercial proportions. Therefore, just as we enjoy keeping a sparkling home for ourselves and guests who visit us at home, the housekeeping department takes pride in keeping the hotel clean and comfortable, so as to create a home away from home. At home, the mantle of good housekeeping falls on the lady of the house. It is not surprising then that this tradition extends to the hotels as well, where the housekeeper is, in most cases, a woman.

The concept of housekeeping is simplistic but when one considers maintaining a house of several hundreds rooms and numerous public areas, the task becomes gigantic and more complex. It takes a wellorganised approach and technical understanding to enable housekeeping to cope with the volume of work.

A hotel survives largely on the sale of rooms and food and beverage and to a smaller extent on other minor operating departments such as the laundry, health club, etc. Of these, the sale of rooms constitutes a minimum of 50 percent. In other words, a hotels largest margin of profit comes from room sales because a room, once made, can be sold over and over again. A good hotel operation ensures optimal room sales to bring in the maximum profit.

The room sale is dependent on, apart from several other things, the quality of room décor, room facilities, cleanliness of the room and how safe it is. The criteria by which each guest decides whether a room is good or bad is strictly personal. Since their choices vary, the task of appealing to all kinds of guests becomes overwhelming. To make a room appealing to a guest is the task of housekeeping which has to ensure that the basic human needs of comfort and security are met. Therefore, the personal effort of the housekeeping department has a direct bearing on the guest experience in a hotel.

Housekeeping, as was mentioned earlier, is an extension of the home where traditionally the mother keeps a sparkling house. She ensures it is clean; that all defective items in the house are repaired;  and  that  the  home  is  kept  attractive  with  choice  furnishings,  artefacts  and  floral arrangements. Housekeeping, in a commercial sense, is the same but with a greater volume of activities and challenges. It involves specialised equipment, tools, cleaning solutions, and the technical know-how in their applications. Housekeeping, as mentioned before, encompasses three major functions:

- 1. Cleaning
- 2. Maintenance
- 3. Aesthetic upkeep of the property

Let us look at each to understand their full implications:

## Cleaning

Cleaning is not just having a duster cloth in hand and wiping surfaces. While it may include that activity too, it requires a comprehensive understanding of different surfaces and the best tools and solutions to clean them to preserve the long life of those surfaces.  There are different surfaces in a large commercial operation like a hotel that poses a challenge for the housekeeper. Firstly, she must have the knowledge of these surfaces and their properties, then the technical knowledge of how best she can clean them. She must also know how to manage different degrees of stains and soil. The different types of surfaces that challenge a housekeeper are:

- l Tar used in road surfaces and roof finishing.
- l Wood of different types including cork found in furniture and floorings.
- l Granite or marble used extensively nowadays for wall and floor finishing as well as counter tops for receptions and bathroom sinks.
- l Ceramic tiles used as alternative flooring to other expensive material. They may be found in bathrooms, kitchens and receiving areas where a lot of water may be used.
- l Linoleum used as cheaper flooring for back office facilities.
- l Rubber used for soundproofed rooms like studios and meeting rooms.
- l Plastic, vinyl or fibre glass used in various artifacts and office equipment.
- l Metal including aluminium, chrome, galvanized iron, lead, oxidized silver, pewter, stainless steel, zinc and tin used in a varied applications.
- l Cane and wicker used in furniture and artifacts.
- l Leather used in furniture
- l Cloth used for upholstery and furnishings

All the surfaces require independent understanding of their use and their properties. Lesson 9, Cleaning Knowledge and Practice deals extensively on the subject.

## Maintenance

The role of housekeeping in maintenance is to identify and follow-up on those items that are malfunctioning or defective throughout the facility and ensure that they are rectified with engineering support. Since housekeeping has access to all parts of a facility in the execution of their cleaning role, they are the right people to locate deficiencies and report them to the engineering for rectification. Engineering support comes in the way of electrical, mechanical, civil, carpentry, plumbing and any masonry work. The housekeeping staff, for example, will identify corridor lights that are not working; bathroom taps that are leaking, lobby chairs that wobble or meeting room walls that show water seepage. Hotels have an effective communication system between housekeeping and engineering to alert and rectify problems. In some establishments, housekeeping staff are trained to attend to some basic engineering needs such as changing fused bulbs, attending to defective TV connections or changing a washer of a leaking tap.

## Aesthetic Upkeep

Aesthetic upkeep are those measures used to beautify the property. This includes landscaping around the premises, as well as providing the flower arrangements and decorations in internal public areas and offices. To do this, the housekeeper has to have basic knowledge of horticulture including the maintenance of nurseries and green houses. She would also be concerned with floral art to keep interiors attractive. At this stage, we must clearly know the difference between the role of housekeeping in internal décor and that of the internal designer. The interior designer plans the layout of the facility so that it serves the guests as well as those that provide services to them. She will decide on the theme colour combinations, traffic flows, service stations etc. The housekeeping role is to maintain the facility as conceived by the interior designer. She provides those inputs that need daily replacement like floral arrangements. Some accomplished housekeepers may even be qualified interior decorators. The housekeeping department, therefore, is responsible to make the internal and external facilities attractive on a daily basis with the help of qualified horticulturists and florists.

## Career Paths

A person who decides to enter the housekeeping field may have several career options. The entry into the housekeeping field can be based on the educational attainment of a candidate or the number of years of experience in previous positions. The chart below gives a graphic idea of the correlation of educational attainment with the entry point in a hotel. It also charts out the career path for those without the minimum educational qualifications:

One observes in the chart above that there are two paths (shown by arrows) to reach higher positions. One path is a direct entry level which requires a minimum educational qualification with training to fill the position. In that stream there are several educational options:

- 1. A person can join housekeeping at the lowest skilled level after having completed junior high school or a minimum 10 years of schooling. They could join directly and receive on-job training by the hiring organisation for minimum durations as per their policy. Alternatively, the candidate can enroll into an institution that provides technical education. Governments in  most  countries  provide  trade  qualifications  for  different  professions  in  their  effort  to encourage skills to feed the hotel industry. It is also a measure to empower individuals to acquire gainful employment. In India, the Indian Technical Institutes are a good example of such technical education. The Department of Tourism in India has supported State Tourism Departments to create the Food Craft Institutes to provide technical qualifications for the hospitality industry. All technical institutes provide trade certificates.
- 2. A person may enter the housekeeping profession with a high school certificate or a minimum of 12 years in school. Such students do a technical diploma that qualifies them to enter the hospitality industry at supervisory levels. The right choice would be to do a three year diploma in hotel management. With this qualification, they get the priority to enter the hospitality industry at supervisory levels. Those hotel diploma students who choose only the housekeeping profession will need about 6 months practical training in housekeeping by the hiring hotel for them to be confirmed as a supervisor.
- 3. At management levels, the minimum educational qualification for a direct entry would be a Bachelors degree in Hotel Management. In spite of the degree, the candidate would require one-year training in housekeeping with the hotel that hires them. This training is to give students a practical exposure to real life housekeeping. There are other students who are graduates in other disciplines like liberal arts, social sciences, science or commerce who may opt for a housekeeping career as a post graduation decision. They will need 18 months to two years onthe-job training and classroom lectures to qualify as a housekeeping supervisor.
- 4. Those aspiring for senior management levels require a minimum graduation preferably in hotel management. This would have to be supported by a minimum three years of experience in an earlier position to qualify for the post.

We also notice that those who do not have the educational qualification for entry can also aspire for higher positions given a minimum adequate experience in an earlier position. We must understand that higher positions require more than just knowledge of the trade. It requires understanding of a larger aspect of housekeeping which include supervisory skills and the effective utilization of resources. Report writing, leadership skills, decision-making skills are not altogether learnt by experience alone. They need some additional classroom inputs to adopt best practice in dealing with them.

## FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

## 1. Does a career in housekeeping attract good salaries?

The salaries at skilled and supervisory levels are adequate for a basic standard of living supported by statutory perquisites such as annual leave, leave fares to ones hometown and back, medical coverage, medical leave including extended maternity leave, and house rent allowance. Most hotels support the salary with jobrelated benefits such as free onduty meals, uniforms, laundering of uniforms, transportation to and from home and overtime. These facilities make earnings more than comfortable. At management levels, the earning power makes a quantum leap with perks and benefits equal to any other profession within hotels and other industries.

## 2. What status does the housekeeping have in the hospitality industry?

We realise in previous chapters and those chapters ahead that housekeeping is crucial to hotel operations. All departments lean on them for the proper facilitation of their work. They do respect the department and give them full cooperation. In recognition of this importance, the Executive Housekeeper holds senior position equivalent to a Food and Beverage Manager, Front Office manager etc. reporting directly to the General Manager. Chain operations also employ a Corporate Housekeeper who is the senior most housekeeping resource to guide general managers of hotel in the chain.

## 3. Can I become a General Manager of a hotel if I were an Executive Housekeeper?

While there are few cases of Executive Housekeepers who have risen to General Managers positions, it is normally unlikely. Housekeeping is considered as a specialist position and not a generalist one. Housekeeping, however, has its own hierarchy that is equivalent or even more senior to a General Managers position. We have positions as Director Housekeeping, Area Executive Housekeeper or Corporate Housekeepers who earn good salaries as well as command a status equivalent to other senior positions.

## 4. Is housekeeping a womans profession?

Traditionally, housekeeping has been dominated by women. This was done on the belief that the hotel was an extension of the home and that women had the skills and competencies to execute the function best. However, men have entered this profession and have succeeded equally well. Hotels may choose a male for many reasons:

- 1. Some countries like those in the Gulf States that uphold traditional Islamic values may not permit women to work in public locations such as guest rooms.
- 2. Chains find it difficult to transfer a woman from one hotel to another easily as they would be uprooting her domestic links.
- 3. Women start careers and abandon it when they get married and start a family due to social and family commitments.

## 5. Who employs qualified housekeepers apart from hotels?

Readers would be surprised to see the range of businesses that employ housekeepers and other housekeeping personnel:

- l Airlines, Airports

## UNDERSTANDING GUEST SERVICE

## Introduction

Readers must understand that housekeeping personnel are guest contact people. While they work unobtrusively on guest floors and public areas, they are nevertheless upfront, in direct contact

with the guest and can enhance or mar the impressions of the  property  on  the  guest.  They  must,  therefore,  have excellent guest contact skills. What does this mean? This means that the people working in a hotel make the difference in creating a positive guest experience. Most hotels of the same  category  are  physically  comparable  to  their competitors. Rooms, lobbies, coffee shops etc. look almost alike.  But  the  people  who  work  in  them  make  guest

experiences different. In this chapter, we shall focus on housekeeping personnel and the guest. It is better understood when one looks at the housekeeping staff as the host and the customer as the guest. This throws the perspectives and attitudes at a totally different level. At home we go that extra distance to welcome guests, give them unrivalled hospitality with food and drink, keep them safe and anticipate and attend to their every need. Providing a guest experience is a cycle of events that starts with the housekeeping staff as the host with her attitudes and service mindset, which has a bearing upon the fact that whether they meet the guests expectations, needs and perceptions, resulting in a response as schematically shown below:

<!-- image -->

Let us take each component and understand it carefully:

## My Attitude

What is an attitude? An attitude is the way one communicates a mood to others, who respond accordingly. A happy host will get a happy response just as a sour person gets a negative response. The question arises: Is my attitude positive or negative? Let us look at some symptoms of each:

## Positive Attitudes

- l Being optimistic
- l Feeling good about oneself
- l Feeling good about others
- l Feeling good about life

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- l Seeing the best in others
- l Expecting good things to happen
- l Seeing the bright side of all situations
- l Being enthusiastic
- l Being creative and open
- l Anticipating successful encounters
- l Each customer is an exciting challenge

## Negative Attitudes

- l I am bored
- l I do not have time
- l It wont work
- l I cannot get organised
- l Im too busy
- l I dont know what to say
- l I am nervous
- l I cannot do it
- l I dont stand a chance
- l I dont have energy
- l Nobody likes me
- l I am not good enough
- l Others are better than me
- l I cannot win
- l Its not my day
- l I am scared of customers

Obviously positive attitudes have a greater range of benefits to the self and to the people he/she interacts with. Lets look at some of these:

## Benefits of Positive Attitudes

- l Creates enthusiasm
- l Enhances creativity
- l Magnifies positivity
- l People like you
- l Boss likes to work with you
- l You become helpful
- l Makes others positive
- l Wins cooperation
- l You become popular

The next question that arises is, How do we develop a positive behaviour? Here are some tips.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Habits: Our brain has been registering every experience since the pre-natal stage. We have been growing with instructions, information and experiences from our parents, teachers and society. The brain has recorded it all. Unfortunately, what we remember is only 25% of all that we learn. Our awareness stems from our conscious brain. A great part of our experience lie in our subconscious which constitutes 75% of our brain capacity. The conscious and the subconscious parts of our mind drive our behaviour and we are sometimes aware but mostly unaware of those triggers that influence our behaviour. If we behave negatively, it is because of negative influences in our growing years that have come to stay in our subconscious. This means that we use only onefourth of our brain capacity to correct ourselves and define new ways of behaviour when threefourths lies undetected and therefore, uncorrected.

There are scientific ways to reach our subconscious through sensitivity training, hypnosis and regression analysis. These are outside the purview of this book. The best way, therefore, to overcome those negative influences that drive our behaviour is to develop conscious habits. What is a habit? A habit is a constant, often unconscious, inclination to perform some act acquired through its frequent repetition. This, then, influences our behaviour.

## An action repeated becomes a habit

## A habit repeated becomes a behaviour

## . .

The approach, then, is to change habits by constant conscious repetition. It takes thirty days to change a habit. It starts with a belief.

Beliefs: What is a belief? It is accepting a thought as true. There are so many beliefs we carry about ourselves and about others. When these beliefs are negative and clash, our behaviour becomes

negative, often resulting in violence. We need to change our beliefs about ourselves and others. How do we get to know our belief system and how they affect others? It is achieved simply by asking others of how they perceive your beliefs. Such a feedback should be received openly and not by defending them. Introspection of these beliefs is necessary to find out areas of improvement. The next step is to define a schedule of improvement by defining actions to be taken and the time period by which such behaviours would be rectified. One of  the  proven  methods  for  correction  is  autosuggestion.  What  is autosuggestion? Autosuggestion is a voluntary talking to oneself to change an

attitude, action, habit or feeling. A person interested in developing positive attitudes must develop a programme of repeating frequently positive behaviours over a period of thirty days, for oneself. It would be useful to remember the following:

Programming creates Beliefs.

Beliefs create Attitudes. Attitudes create Feelings. Feelings determine Action Action creates Results.

## My Service

What is a service? It is the total experience that a customer gets through people, when satisfying a need. Service touches all the senses of a discerning customer. Let us examine each component:

Sense of sight: Customers like to see a wellgroomed person. Grooming has been touched upon extensively in the next chapter (Lesson 2.4 entitled  Competencies of Housekeeping Staff ). The way the hotel is kept neat and orderly creates the service experience just as the décor and the artifacts that adorn it.

Sense of smell: A guest is influenced by how fresh a hotel smells. It gives him or her confidence of the hygiene standards of the establishment. The aroma of food in the dining industry is well known. Appetizing smells trigger hunger and want. The chef builds this into the total food preparation and presentation. We have known coffee shops to crush coffee beans to give that fresh coffee aroma to the passersby to attract them to the restaurant. Similarly, a guest evaluates a server on how s/he smells. A light perfume or cologne conjures up images of hygiene and freshness. A fresh smelling guest room is the first thing that greets him/her when entering the room.

Sense of hearing : There are things that should not be heard by the customer and things that should. A customer does not like to hear housekeeping personnel fighting among themselves, backoffice discussions, rude language, slang, technical jargon, etc. What they like to hear is the courtesy shown by the housekeeping staff; the use of their name; suggestions in case of doubt by the guest; low tones and words of etiquette like Thank you, Please, May I help you? etc.

Sense of taste: This is the one most applicable to the food industry. Taste defines the customers ultimate experience. Chefs have gone to the extent of providing the experience with innovative use of spices, cooking methods and beverages. It is common to find wine enhancing the flavours of sauces and extracts of herbs to marinate meat. The taste of meat cooked in earthen ovens is different from those cooked on charcoal spits. Taste is the distinctive signature of a cuisine offered by an establishment. The chefs skill provides the experience. Taste can be interpreted in another way as far as housekeeping staff is concernedthe taste of quality service! The investor has already built in taste in the aesthetics shown in the interior design and décor. Guests immediately recognize the quality of the property by the appointments, furnishings, carpeting etc. used in the physical product. They must now taste the quality of service.

Sense of touch: The temperature levels in the lobby and in the guest room, the softness of bed and bathroom linen, the fluffiness of the pillow are some examples that create the experience of touch. Housekeeping staff can enhance the sense of touch by providing crisp bedroom and bathroom linen; dust free table tops and counters; smooth face and toilet tissues; etc.

## Understanding Customer Needs and Wants

We must first understand the difference between needs and wants. Needs are essential to human wellbeing. These could include those that are essential to human survival such as food, water, clothing and shelter at the basic level, to those that are essential for self-actualization. Wants are the cultural manifestation of those needs. An American needs food just as much as an Indian but he may prefer to have a burger rather than a dosa to satisfy his hunger. While an American may interpret his need to have a bath by wanting a bathtub, an Indian will be comfortable with a shower. An American interprets clothing in terms of a demand for jeans while the Indian the sari.

Abraham Maslow, a social scientist,  explained  the  concept  of  needs  most  dramatically  by proclaiming that:

- 1. All humans have needs.
- 2. These needs can be collated into five broad categories.
- 3. The categories have an ascending hierarchical order.
- 4. The needs of the lower category must be satisfied to move to the higher category. (Later scientists proved that all needs can co-exist together in varying levels of importance to every individual).

This was very well displayed in the famous Maslows Need Hierarchy as shown below.

Maslows Need Hierarchy

<!-- image -->

The needs start from the bottom and we shall examine how they reflect in providing the perfect guest experience.

<!-- image -->

Physiological Needs: These are the basic needs for survival such as food, water, clothing, shelter, air and sex (for procreation of the human species). The hotel and restaurant industry recognizes basic needs and meets the need for food by offering a spread of cuisines, and shelter by providing a home away from home through its choice of rooms. Hotels provide potable water and proper air-circulation in guest rooms. To the employees, the industry provides free duty meals, uniforms, house rent allowance or staff accommodation and proper working conditions. The kitchens and laundry which are very humid and hot especially in hot climates are provided with proper exhausts and fresh air supply.

Security Needs: As  seen  in  the  diagram  above,  the  security  need  is  both physical and emotional. The guests want to be sure that the property they are visiting is physically safe from anything that may endanger the body. They want to make sure that their rooms are safe to sleep in. Hotels provide locks, fire warning systems, sprinklers, fire-fighting equipment, latch chains, peep-holes etc. to satisfy this need of physical safety. Guests want to be warned of wet floors and the name of the callers before responding to a telephone. The same

<!-- image -->

is true of the staff who should announce themselves when they knock on a door or ring the door bell. A welltrained security staff protects the safety of guests and employees.

A guests need for emotional security comes in many ways. First is the need to be welcomed and recognized in an establishment. The guests want to make sure that the people who serve them welcome them with warmth and sincerity. The staff must be hygienically clean and free from

<!-- image -->

diseases. The guests notice this by the way the staff groom themselves. The guests want to make sure that the raw materials used in food preparation are fresh and that the cooking utensils are clean and sanitised. They also value their privacy as also the fact that they are being treated with courtesy and respect. The hospitality industry is concerned about this aspect for its employees too. They provide safe working conditions and give safety training, especially in the use of equipment and carrying heavy loads, to their  staff.  Emotional  security  is  provided  to  the  employees  through

orientation programmes so that they feel secure quickly in a new organisation. Providing job descriptions and training helps the employee realise what is expected of them and hope that they can perform to the best of standards. Grievance procedures, suggestion systems, performance evaluation are all organisational processes meant to give the employees emotional security.

Belonging: Human beings are social animals. They prosper and grow when they interact with others. This behaviour was noticed even in the early cavemen who lived together to form tribes. Hotels are great social spots to meet this need. They have made human interaction into a fine art

they are the places where people meet and socialize. The popularity of the pubs and taverns called locals since the early days in Europe till today has been precisely to serve this purpose. Local people met at these pubs to learn about new developments in their community and the world. This has continued to date where people can meet here for business or pleasure. Business entertainment has become a part of the relationship building between business stakeholders. Hotels have responded well with ample opportunities for such liaisons. Employees are empowered with this need

<!-- image -->

for  belonging  by  means  of  their  identity  cards  which  identifies  them  with  the  organisation. Establishments provide social clubs where employees can meet for sport or social meetings.

Status and Self-esteem: While status is the way others perceive us, self-esteem is the way we perceive ourselves. Hotels provide the perfect platform to satisfy varying status needs. This shows in the rating system from one to five-star. Each is distinguished by the pricing, level of service and food offered based on the customers needs and wants. Self-Esteem is a bit tricky. Some people are diffident when they do not understand how to adjust the thermostat in the room. A room attendants intervention tactfully to explain how it functions helps in removing the discomfort without trampling on the guests self-esteem. Customers do not want to feel embarrassed in such public places and strive to put forth their best behaviour. Employees within the industry are given ranks, perquisites and uniforms to distinguish them within and without the organisation. Selfesteem is given by empowering the employees to act with authority. Suggestion Schemes also permit employees to participate in the progress of the organisation by acting on their views and ideas.

Self Actualisation: This is a state when human beings reach their potential and are able to control and contribute to the environment. The hotel industry has recognized this and has come up with innovative methods to meet this need. Hotels provide do-it-yourself opportunities by installing coffee stations in the room so that guests can prepare coffee at will. Hotels involve guests to help the establishment to respond to their needs. They invite guests to give their impressions of the total experience by filling guest comment forms. Guests now feel that they can contribute to the establishments prosperity.

## Summary

We gather through this chapter that it is the people who make the difference between a good and a bad guest experience. A good guest experience starts with the self. The housekeeping professional must develop a positive attitude before s/he can expect to create a positive impression on a guest. It is possible to develop positive attitudes by identifying areas of improvement and working on them to change negative attitudes to positive ones and converting them into habits. It is also necessary for housekeeping professionals to be sensitive to a guests needs. Needs of the guests range through five stages of physiological, security, belonging, status and self-actualisation. These must be identified and provided for, at each guest interaction.

## INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION

## Introduction

This subject has been introduced to emphasize the importance of interpersonal communication. Interpersonal communication is the talk between two people. Housekeeping staff are in direct contact with guestseither face-to-face or through telephone. It is known that misunderstandings occur due to faulty interpersonal communication resulting in breakdown in relationships. The housekeeping staff cannot afford to have breakdowns in communication with guests, as it directly affects the image of the property and the resultant ill-will among the travelling public.

The reader will go through a series of slides developed by the author for presentations at various forums. Each slide will be explained in detail. While communications is a wide subject which covers internal  business  communication,  marketing  communication,  public  relations,  mass communications, etc, this chapter is restricted to basic interpersonal communication. Let us see the number of individuals the housekeeping staff talks to on a daily basis, if not on a moment-tomoment basis:

<!-- image -->

The diagram above gives ample evidence of the number of people, both internal and external, that the housekeeping employee is exposed to and communicates with as part of her daily routine. The frequency of communication is constant and therefore, all the housekeeping staff must be effective in their interpersonal communication skills. The following slides show the hazards of communication and what must be done to avoid them.

## Basic Communication System

Let us start with the basic communication system that governs all interpersonal communication.

<!-- image -->

In the above process flow, we have two participantsthe sender and the receiver. The sender can  be  the  housekeeping  employee  speaking  to  the  guest  who  is  the  receiver.  The  sender communicates a message through various ways (medium). The receiver listens to the communication and responds (feedback) to the sender. Such responses can be in verbal communication, nonverbal communication (body language) or action (physical expression). Most worrisome are those responses that are not expressed immediately but withheld to express to others resulting in wordof-mouth anti-publicity.

Lets take each component of the basic communication system starting with the sender.

## Sender

<!-- image -->

A sender can communicate in verbal or non-verbal ways. Verbal communication brings in the aspect of language. If the housekeeping employee does not speak the language of the guest, then no communication can take place. The housekeeping employee will immediately call someone who speaks the same language to communicate effectively. If there is no employee who speaks the language then the housekeeping employee will use words to express the message. The word room may be understood by a travelling guest but the word policy may not. The guest may understand  it  as  police  and  get  agitated  thinking  why  the  police  is  being  mentioned!  The housekeeping employee will then try to use the non-verbal communication to supplement the word through gestures. She may use the word room showing a room in a brochure and reinforce the word policy by pointing to the rules and regulations book. This may be an improvement but does not guarantee that the communication has been understood.

Even when language is perfectly understood, misunderstandings can still take place. If, for instance, the housekeeping employee does not acknowledge an arriving guest on the floor, the guest can assume that the housekeeping employee is rude, does not care, is too busy, does not welcome him, is ignoring him, etc. There can be as many number of possible interpretations of this gesture of ignoring as the number of guests. Even though no verbal communication has taken place, the gesture of not acknowledging is a communication that is subject to any number of responses. The best thing for a busy housekeeping employee to do is to smile and say, Good morning. The chances of misunderstandings are vastly reduced by this simple phrase.

We, therefore, come to the aspect of body language. It is alarming to know how much we communicate through body language whether we speak or not. The statistics below are ample proof of this:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

While verbal communication is reinforced by such things as the accent, speed of sentence delivery, tone of voice and the passion with which we say things; body language can convey messages differently or can be made to reinforce the words. The hospitality industry, therefore, gives a lot of importance to the way the hotel employees look and groom themselves. Poise is essential to show professionalism. A room attendant may lean against the wall or slouch while talking. She may say anything but is portraying to the customer that she is lazy, indifferent, non-professional, etc. Our hands are a great giveaway. Left unlocked, hands express all sorts of emotions including anger, accusation, etc. Professional behaviour will insist that the hands are locked behind or clasped in front when idle. It may be used only to deliberately emphasize a word or sentence like in the example of a room and brochure. Body language is expressed in the following ways:

<!-- image -->

The value of eye-contact cannot be more emphasized. Eye contact indicates a range of positive impressions including, confidence, sincerity, honesty, reliability, etc. Nothing is more loathsome to a guest when a housekeeping employee speaks to a guest while looking elsewhere into her computer or some other object. Gestures like arms hugging the body can convey closed communication. The nod of the head can indicate attentiveness and also disapproval.

Facial expressions are another way to communicate. The hospitality industry encourages its frontline employees to smile while talking. This immediately relaxes a guest and breaks down any negative barriers. Those who communicate on phone too are encouraged to smile while speaking. The tone of voice becomes cheerful. People have forgotten how they look when they smile. A front desk professional will make it a habit to look into the mirror and smile and make it a way of continuous behaviour.

Gestures are another giveaway. A shrug of the shoulder can show indifference. Pointing at a guest exhibits superiority and accusation. Doodling on paper while a guest is speaking can show boredom. The trick is to use gestures to enhance a guest experience. A handshake, a bow or the Indian namaste shows welcome.

How we stand reflects our poise, as discussed earlier. The housekeeping professional always stands erect.

Distance and angle also conveys different images. Standing too close reflects familiarity. Most people like to maintain their personal boundaries. Standing too far gives the perception of distance and aloofness. A housekeeping employee who speaks to the guest while turning her body away from him shows indifference, inattentiveness or under-confidence. Housekeeping personnel must square up and present the full body to the guest.

A lot has been spoken about appearance . It is desirable that public personnel are personable and attractive. The Human Resources department looks into this aspect when selecting them at the time of recruitment. Grooming is another imperative standard for housekeeping staff. Uniforms must be clean and wellpressed. All aspects of personal grooming like hair style, manicured nails, clean hands etc. are monitored in shift briefings.

## Medium

Now let us look at medium. Medium is the channel chosen to communicate a message. This choice is the direct responsibility of the sender. If s/he chooses the wrong medium, the message will not be received effectively. The different type of media available to the sender are:

The physical medium is the most effective at the work place. A simple pat of encouragement on the back has a tremendous impact on the recipient. Of course, the housekeeping employee is not going to pat a guest on the back as it would show familiarity! We have seen that professional behaviour requires the professional to keep a distance. However, a firm handshake is the most effective physical contact in welcoming a guest.

There are several modes of written communication . Some of them include printed material, hoardings, advertisements, etc. In housekeeping, the written documents that drive systems and procedures are very vital for communication. If a control desk attendant does not fill the maintenance order form to register a maintenance requirement, s/he will not be able to communicate to the rest of the team that a maintenance request that requires certain procedures by all to follow up on, has taken  place.  (Please  see  Lesson  3.4,  Business  Communication  for  details  on  written communication).

We have covered verbal medium which is also referred to as oral communication.

Mental communication goes into the realms of the mental telepathy and hypnosis which are not in the purview of this chapter. But we can extrapolate that emotions are a give away of thought processes. Therefore, a smile is emphasized to all guest contact personnel even if they are speaking on phone.

Audio communication refers to the bells, telephone rings, car horns and alarms that we hear everyday. They communicate through sound precisely what it is intended for. A housekeeping employee knows that she has to answer the telephone when it rings. A guest knows that his attention is sought when the bell boy rings the bells of the paging board. The bell desk knows that a guest has arrived at the porch when the doorman rings the bell.

Communication gets more effective when we have combinations of these mediums. So we have audio-visual communication when business guests have a teleconference facility, where they can see each other and speak over long distances. A guest can identify the callers name or number when the phone rings in the room. The television is a strong example of this medium. Audio-oral communication goes into the realm of CDs, cassettes and radio. Music is an important part of communication when a hotel wants to create an ambience in the lobby. Coffee Shops are great at creating ambience when they change the type of music during the day from rock and roll songs to lounge music. The telephone instrument is the greatest invention in this genre. The wakeup call systems are good examples of audio-oral communication when the telephone rings to wake the guest and the operator announces the time.

Technology is making great strides in the area of communications. Computers, mobile phones, telecommunications etc hold great promises to the way we do things in the future.

## Message

This refers to the actual content of what is being communicated. One thing that readers must learn is to never assume what has been said has also been understood correctly. It takes years of a relationship to reach that perfect point of understanding. Guests who are casual acquaintances cannot reach that level of understanding. So communication has to be very carefully expressed. Let us see what distorts a message:

While the points above are self-explanatory, one must understand that communication is best when it happens with people being face-to-face. The sender gets immediate feedback through words or body language whether the message has been understood or not. Fortunately, the housekeeping  employee  communicates  mostly  face-to-face  with  guests.  This  improves  the probability of a message being understood. Telephone communication becomes more difficult to pass a message because the sender cannot see the person at the other end of the line and vice versa. Likewise, passing verbal messages through another person also makes communication a bit tough. There is bound to be a distortion in the message as several experiments has proved. Written communication is better as long as the other person has access to the text. Modern software and common servers allow people to communicate directly to written information. This is a great stride in passing correct information. For example, the telephone operator, the room service ordertaker, concierge and reception have access to a common server that shows the latest arrivals and departures. There cannot be any distortion in the information. The earlier manual system had each party checking with the front desk on phone which had its own pitfalls in communication in spite of the best of efforts.

## Receiver

The receiver has the greatest challenge as there are too many barriers in his way to reach a perfect understanding. These barriers are:

Perception is the selection of what one wants to see or hear from a total message. A housekeeping employee may say, I am sorry your room is being prepared according to your high standards. It shall be ready in ten minutes, would you kindly wait in the lobby and I shall call you as soon as it is

ready. The guest may perceive only the word wait and respond favorably or unfavorably. The guest has selected the worst word that will cause his inconvenience. The wonderful part of the message that the room is being prepared as per his high standards or that the wait is only for ten minutes is lost to the guest. This is unfortunate but a barrier in communication.

Projection is the interpretation by the receiver of what s/he has perceived based on his or her past experiences. The word wait is now being given a meaning which can be interpreted as rudeness, indifference, inconvenience, poor professionalism or being sidelined for another guest. Naturally, the guest is now going to respond in a negative manner.

Level of abstraction is another great pitfall. Abstraction means vagueness or something that does  not  have  an  understandable  form.  For  example,  a  guest  may  want  a  baby-sitter.  The housekeeping employee can assign her any type of baby-sitter at any time. The housekeeping employee must reduce the level of abstraction by asking questions to further clarify the type of baby-sitter required. She may ask questions like:

- l Would you like a male or female babysitter?
- l How old is the child?
- l What time do you require her and for how long?
- l Her charges are.., is it alright with you?

With each question, the housekeeping employee is reducing the level of abstraction. Housekeeping staff are trained to ask pertinent questions to reduce the levels of communication. Sometimes forms and formats are so designed to reduce the level of abstraction of information received.

The role of  a  sender is also important when receiving messages. A role is the position or designation of the person who has to offer services. A guest may ask a room attendant for an extra blanket but may approach the lobby manager for special discounts or the General Manager for a complimentary stay. Each position has its own level of authority. The modern mantra in

management is empowerment. Managements are pushing greater authority down to guest interface positions like floor supervisors and room attendants. A housekeeping employee may well have the authority to give special discounts and complimentary stay.

The receiver is also influenced by the context of a message. So if a guest sees other guests being given priority treatment, it will naturally provoke a negative response from him.

Emotions expressed by the sender are a great influence on a receiver. A pleasant and cheerful housekeeper will convey the same cheer to the guest, while a grouchy one will get the same response from the guest. Housekeeping staff irrespective of their personal circumstances have to always present a cheerful exterior and emotion. This is tough, but is the requirement of the professional attitude.

A receiver likes to hear things based on his or her experiences. S/he likes to be wished as per the time of the day when entering the floor or approaching her room. S/he hears this throughout his or her travels worldwide. So when this is missed in any hotel, s/he interprets this negatively. Hotels do take great pains in scripting greetings for all the staff especially those in regular guest contact. This is to bring about conformity to global standards that guests are exposed to.

Language is a great challenge to the global traveller. He cannot receive messages or understand them if there is an obvious language barrier. Hotels now make it a point to recruit multilingual staff to communicate with international guests. While English is the global language of communication, French, German and Spanish were credible alternatives because of the earlier economic situation of Europe, that encouraged travel. With globalisation, new alternative languages have cropped up such as Russian, Hindi, Japanese and Chinese. This is in response of the new economic zones that are developing rapidly, and people from these regions are travelling more frequently worldwide. This means that the housekeeping personnel must have skills in the new languages to be able to communicate effectively.

Distractions can be a great barrier in communication. Nothing is more annoying to a guest than a housekeeping employee constantly interrupting conversation to answer telephone calls or to talk to other staff members. Distractions in communications can be caused by pre-occupations with work, loud noises or music, staff talking loudly in the course of their duties, arguments with other guests, etc. Professional hotels would ensure that these distractions are eliminated or kept to a minimum through staff training, scheduling and technology interventions.

Bias is a predisposition to a thought or idea. These biases are built through experience and cannot be avoided. A Frenchman may not like to speak in English, or any language other than French. You may call it national pride. This is, however, a predisposition. A guest may check and re-check his wake-up-call instructions to the point of being irritating. S/he apparently has had a bad experience of oversleeping before and is petrified of it recurring again.

If these are the number of barriers to receiving a message, communication becomes increasingly challenging. The question arises as to who is responsible to overcome these barriers? It is the sender.  S/he has to ensure through training, systems and procedures that these barriers are eliminated at the time of transmitting a message. One of the simplest methods employed to eliminate barriers in communication is to ask the receiver to repeat the message. So when a guest gives instructions, the housekeeping staff will repeat each and every word s/he says to confirm to

<!-- image -->

the sender that the message is understood and correct. This completes the loop of the basic communication system.

## Summary

We talk with each other daily. We take for granted that what is said is understood. We do not realise how wrong we are. Interpersonal communication is an art that requires practice and conscious attention. Verbal communication becomes more critical at the work place. We cannot afford to guess the outcomes. Instructions must be followed and dialogue with guests must evoke positive responses and images. Perfect communication is not with guests alone. It has to be with fellow employees as well.

## 1.1 TYPES OF HOTELS AND THEIR CATEGORISATION

## Introduction

It is important for housekeeping professionals to know what it means to work in a hotel and the type of hotel they serve. The type of hotel determines the level of service desired and the facilities offered. The guest rooms of a deluxe hotel will naturally have superior furnishings and amenities than those in an economy hotel. Similarly, business hotels in downtown locations will have different housekeeping dynamics than a resort property. This lesson helps the reader to comprehensively understand and place the hotel they work for against several options available in the market.

British Law defines a Hotel or Inn as a place where a bonafide traveller can receive food and shelter, provided s/he is in a position to pay for it and is in a fit condition to be received. Therefore, a hotel must provide food (and beverages) and lodging to travellers, on payment and has, in turn, the right to refuse admission if the traveller is drunk, disorderly, unkempt or is not in a position to pay for the services.

<!-- image -->

By this  definition,  a  hotel  must  provide  rooms  and  meals.  The provision  of  beverages  is  subject  to  local  customs  and  practices. Therefore, in Europe and America, bars are an important part of the hotel  facilities  while  in  Islamic  countries  bars  may  be  considered  a taboo on religious grounds. One thing is certain that the rights of admission are reserved and many hotels display that sign prominently at  their  doorways  or  reception.  A  hotel  can  refuse  a  guest  (hotel customer) accommodation if s/he is not in a fit and orderly state. With this tradition, hotels have always been a place where visitors and guests dress  to  look  at  their  best.  The  guest  has  also  to  show  financial credibility. Earlier inns and hotels insisted on advance payment before guests were allocated the room. The credit card has made the issue of financial credibility easier.  Surprisingly, hotels do not accept personal

cheques as a credible instrument of payment. Hotels worldwide also have credit limits as per house policy.  Once  those  limits  are  achieved  it  is  mandatory  for  the  guest  to  clear  the  limit reached even if he or she continues the stay. A hotel, in other words, has the full right to expel a guest for valid reasons of doubt.

## Hotel Categories

With the evolution of hotels and its proliferation around the world, it is impossible to categorise them under one term. This book removes this difficulty for the readers by putting them in various categories as given below:

<!-- image -->

Let us examine each in detail:

## Location

Hotels may be categorised by their locations as follows:

- l Downtown
- l Suburb
- l Resort
- l Airport
- l Motel
- l Camps

Let us examine the unique features of hotels, in detail, based on the locations:

Downtown hotels are located at the centre of the city in busy commercial and shopping districts.

Everyone likes to stay downtown within easy reach of the government  and  private  offices,  shopping  malls  and entertainment centres. However, since the price of land is expensive, the rates of rooms in these hotels are high to enable the investor to get a good return on his investment. Investors, therefore, believe in constructing quality hotels to cater  to  a  moneyed  clientele,  usually  the  business  and corporate community. The business community is the one that  owns  businesses  while  the  corporate  community comprises professionals who work for businesses at senior

<!-- image -->

positions. Up-market tourist groups may also find downtown hotels affordable. Usually downtown hotels will cater to guests on short visits which are upto a maximum of one week stay. Downtown hotels in Asia get their prestige from foreign guests as the exchange rate between the west and the east makes even seemingly expensive prices locally, quite affordable to the foreign guest. However, in the global economy room prices around the world are more or less equal. Premium brands of hotel chains and independent hotels of a very high quality are found in downtown locations.  Naturally,  these  hotels  will  also  boast  of  leading  restaurants,  bars  and  night  clubs. Downtown hotels are located in districts that have day and night shopping centres, eateries and entertainment. They may prune their costs by having only bars and an allpurpose coffee shop, off the lobby when guests can avail of a plethora of dining restaurants at a walking distance from the hotel. Nowadays, downtown hotels have built purpose-based shopping malls with food courts and Cineplexes along with their hotel for  the  benefit  of  their  guests.  Many  have  also  added residential apartments and commercial office buildings to create a captive community within their precincts. Because of the paucity of space, downtown hotels will be tower blocks and skyscrapers, building upwards to create space and business opportunities.

The challenge to housekeeping professionals will be to prepare rooms for sale at shorter time frames as the turnover of rooms is going to be high due to short stays. The rooms will have superlative furnishings and furniture. These will need special knowledge of how to maintain expensive fabrics. Guest amenities will also complement a moneyed clientele with bathrobes, bath slippers, vanity sets, etc. The public areas will include up-market restaurants and bars, banqueting and meeting facilities that are traditional features of a hotel. But now hotels also boast of shopping malls, entertainment centres, residential complexes, etc. that create new challenges for the housekeeping  personnel.

Suburban hotels are located on the outskirts of a city where land is cheaper than downtown locations. Suburban hotels  are  sprawling  constructions  with  ample  parking spaces.  They  attract  clientele  that  are  costconscious, though  not  necessarily  budgettravellers.  Such  hotels promote  there  facilities  for  training  programmes, conferences and seminars. Participants like to get away from  the  hustle  and  bustle  of  the  city  and  find  the environment peaceful for learning opportunities. Suburban hotels have become quite lucrative to its investors as cities are growing outwards making them self-contained mini-

<!-- image -->

cities. A suburban hotel will soon find itself at the centre of a township that has grown away from the outskirts of the city. Quick and efficient local transportation has made travel to the city centre and back, easy and convenient. With outward growth, many residential townships have developed to make these hotels the centre of activity. Encouraged with these developments, investors have been able to create communities with shopping malls, Cineplexes, residential apartments and office blocks. Travel agents have found suburban hotels offer better room rates and facilities for groups. Suburban hotels, therefore, become ideal group hotels handling volume traffic. We all know that airports are mostly located out of the city for safety reasons. Many suburban hotels close to the airport also gain from the airline crew, passenger layover and transit stay.

Housekeeping professionals will find a different challenge in handling group check-ins and check-outs. Groups are a minimum 15 persons who travel together . They may travel for sight seeing, training programmes, seminars, old boys reunions, etc. Room attendants will have to prepare rooms in volume at a time. In some cases, a group may be waiting in the lobby for the same set of rooms as another group that has just checked out. The pressure to prepare the rooms within strict time frames requires the highest productivity. The public areas may be fewer but the banquet facilities may be larger than the downtown properties.

Resort properties are located at natural and man-made sites. Resort hotels will be found at hill stations, seaside resorts, ski resorts, canyons, waterfalls, etc. Niagara falls, St. Moritz ski resort, Miami beach resort, Safari parks and the Grand Canyon are some good examples of resorts around natural resources.  Disney  Land,  Lego  Land,  Universal  Studios  in Hollywood and dam reservoirs are good examples of man made marvels. Historical monuments like the Taj Mahal in India, Pyramids of Egypt, etc. are other sites for resorts. A resort hotel will, therefore, cater specifically to the visitors of

<!-- image -->

those sites. Many of these resorts are highly seasonal depending upon climates and holidays to get their clientele. Resort properties have to make most of those times and charge as per the season. They would give heavy off-season discounts to the budget-conscious. Such properties would be geared towards families and couples. They would have possibly one all purpose dining room and have meals that depend on local seasonal vegetables.

Housekeeping will have to deal with a laidback style of the resort guests. Most of them come as vacationers and are not bothered with strict time schedules. Housekeepers will have to adjust to flexible timings of guests. For example, vacationers may like to awake late in the day. They may want additional bath towels to bath several times especially at beach resorts and after sightseeing tours. The resort may have independent chalets spread out over several acres bringing a new challenge of distance to the housekeepers. They have to transport linen and amenities over distances and provide a close touch to the isolated accommodation. The resort may have one all-purpose dining room that needs to be kept ready at all times, especially for the three main meals.

Airport Hotels , as the name suggests, are located in the precincts of an airport. They cater mostly  to  transient  airline  passengers  who  may  be  catching  another  flight  to  complete  their

<!-- image -->

journey. Such guests need only a room to sleep before the next flight. They also cater to the passengers with cancelled or delayed flights.  Rather than wait at the airport, the airlines provide hotel facilities to them. Transient airline crews too find the airport hotel convenient between the flights. The airport hotels have a 24-hour coffee shop for quick meals. It is unlikely that these hotels will have gourmet restaurants and entertainment. They would however have large coffee shops to accommodate a full flight of transient passengers and crew. Airport hotels may provide an all-purpose drug store and a few emporiums with local arts and crafts for passengers who really do  not  have  time  for  city  shopping.  Airport  hotels  have  sound

wake-up call services and perhaps, a cyber café. Airport hotels will be linked to airport air traffic schedules for passengers to check of the arrival and departure timings their flight. A shuttle coach service is essential to the airport and left luggage facilities should be provided for those who have a little more time to visit the city. Airport hotels are simple in structure, possibly two floors high and have the least frills.

Airport hotels can pose a dual challenge to housekeepers of a quick turnover of the rooms as well as of cleaning rooms in volume at a given time. The first task is there because the passengers are staying for short durations before catching the next flight and the second task appears when a planeload of passengers are provided free accommodation due to a cancelled/delayed  flight.  While  the  hotel  management  may  predict  flight  arrivals  and departures, they are not sure of emergency requirements that arise, sometimes very often. This requires the housekeeping personnel to be alert to changes in occupancy at any given time. For busy airports which have a continuous stream of airline arrivals and departures, the airport hotel has to man the housekeeping in full for all 24 hours.

Motels are located, in principle, by the highways and road junctions. It is a lodging facility with 15-100 rooms for the automobile traveller. Motels have independent entrance to their rooms which guests have access  to  after  they  have  registered  themselves  at  the  reception. Motels are low buildings maybe a story or two at the most. With ample parking spaces, guests can park their cars in front of their rooms. They do not have the tedium of unloading and reloading their transport with this facility. The rooms are equipped with tea/ coffee kettles, tea/coffee satchels, creamers and sugar to make their

<!-- image -->

own hot beverages. The room also has a microwave oven for the guests to heat their own food. The motel may or may not have a diner and a bar at the most. They may supplement eating facilities with food and beverage dispensers at convenient spots on the floor. Earlier motels provided garage facilities for servicing and handling breakdowns of cars. This is not always possible these days. Rooms are simple and clean with hot and cold shower or bath facilities. Guests have an overnight stay at the most.

Most motels are located in remote areas where qualified housekeepers are not easily available.  Because of this, the motels prune their level of services. They will train local inhabitants with basic skills to prepare a room. Such a staff comes at fixed hours in the morning and is not always available. Many motels are family businesses where the women of the house take up the housekeeping role or multi-skill the reception and housekeeping function. Some motels will contract their housekeeping services to a contracting company

<!-- image -->

from the neighbouring city or town. They may provide transportation for the daily visits of the housekeeping crew.

Camps are located on trekking routes. Automobile travel has revolutionised the way people trek. Families hire caravans which are mobile homes and move from camp to camp, equipped to handle such travel. At each camp, the trekkers could take interior  routes  by  foot.  The  camps  have  large parking lots where caravans are parked. Each lot has a water

hydrant connection and electricity plug-in point to service the caravans. The camp will have common toilet and bath facilities with hot and cold water and an all-purpose diner. Guests would sleep in their own caravans. The earlier camps had spaces to pitch tents with common toilet and bath facilities. Food was cooked around a campfire and people trekked on foot. Other variations are the forest lodges in remote locations that are fully equipped for self cooking, bed linen and water supply, though not necessarily hot water! Payment for the use of the lodge is done at the nearest village office. Some lodges may have a caretaker from the local village to meet the needs of the guests.

Camps and lodges are usually sponsored by state governments who hire local caretakers to keep these facilities clean. It is unlikely that professional housekeepers will find themselves employed, however they could be part of a contracting company who is engaged to clean camps and lodges.

## Number of Rooms

Hotels may be classified by the number of rooms. The size of hotels directly influences the size of the housekeeping brigade. The categorisation by size is as follows:

25 rooms and less

small

26  100 rooms

medium

101-300 rooms

large

300-1000 very large

very large

Above 1000 rooms

mega

The size of property depends on the financial strength of the investor. Most motels, lodges, bed and breakfast establishments, etc. come under the small category where individual families and entrepreneurs  supplement  the  tourism  effort  of  the  country.  More  ambitious  individual entrepreneurs may establish medium-sized properties as a regular business which must give the investor a return on investment. These properties would still be closely held by families to keep a total control on operations and expenditures. The large properties enter a different league where large investments are provided by finances not only by the entrepreneurs own contribution but also by banks, financial institutions and joint ventures. Mega properties have to be financed by public limited companies to raise finance of large proportions.

## Ownership

The size of properties is largely influenced by the financial options available to an investor or a group of investors. Such types of businesses may be classified as follows:

- l Sole Proprietor
- l Partnerships
- l Public Limited Companies (plc)
- l Private Limited Companies (Ltd)

The Sole Proprietor is an individual business who uses his or her own resources to set-up the business. S/he will only limit the size of operations to the extent of his or her financial limits. Funds come from personal wealth in terms of cash and fixed assets,  like  land,  building  and jewelry, against which the proprietor gets additional loans from the banks. The funds must cover

<!-- image -->

the cost of land, building, interiors, facilities and operational costs. Naturally, the sole proprietor will have small-to-medium-sized properties to be able to personally manage. The sole proprietor is the main architect and promoter of the business, based on his or her knowledge and skill. Upon his death, the business ceases to exist unless there is a family heir competent enough to take over the reigns. There are some advantages and disadvantages to sole proprietorship:

## Advantages:

- l Ease of information It is  easy  to  form  as  no  legal  formalities  are  involved  and  the business can be closed whenever the proprietor desires.
- l Direct motivation The proprietor works hard as all the profit comes to him.
- l Flexibility of operations The proprietor can make the necessary changes in nature and size of his business without government regulation or interference.
- l Secrecy The affairs of business can be kept secret as there is no partner to share the confidential information.
- l Prompt decision The proprietor can decide business affairs without consulting anyone.

## Disadvantages:

- l Limited capital Proprietors own assets may be insufficient for the business and his borrowing capacity limited.
- l Limited managerial skills There is lack of specilization in sole proprietorship.
- l Unlimited liability The proprietor is personally responsible for all the liabilities of the firm and so his capacity to take risks is reduced.
- l Lack of continuity The life of a sole proprietor is uncertain and his family may lack the aptitude to continue his business in case of his illness, insolvency or death.

Partnerships are another method of raising funds. Partnerships help in aspiring for medium to large hotels. A partnership is the relation that subsists between persons carrying on a business in common, with a view of profit(1890 Partnership Act of UK). Partners are limited  to  20 persons  only.  Partnerships  can  be  Limited  Companies  or  Unlimited  Companies.  In  Limited Companies the shareholders are liable for debts only to the extent of their investment. In Unlimited Companies the shareholders are liable for all debts of the company.

Public  Limited  Companies (PLC) are  those  companies  with  multiple  shareholders.  They finance mega hotels of 1000 rooms and above. Las Vegas is an example of mega projects where the number of rooms goes as high as 5000 rooms. Obviously, no entrepreneur can finance such a project single handedly and he will have to raise funds by having several shareholders interested in the project. Let us understand the features of Public Limited Companies.

- l Shares are offered to the general public and often traded at stock exchanges
- l Must have at least seven shareholders
- l Created to raise substantial Capital

At this stage, it is important to know that a shareholder becomes the owner of the firm by virtue of buying even one share of the company and has a voting right at the Annual General Body Meetings which are annual meetings of all the shareholders where the Chairman and Directors of the company give the shareholders a feedback on the performance of the company in the last financial year; explain the future plans and projects; and announce the dividends which are the percentage of profit which the company shares with the shareholders. At the meeting,

several decisions are taken by the shareholders who agree or disagree based on the voting rights that  they  have.  Shareholders  become  owners  by  purchasing  shares  which  are  documents  of financial ownership and can be traded at the stock exchange. The company announces a share issue when shareholders can apply for ownership. There are different types of shares as given below:

- l Ordinary Shares those that receive a dividend. Entitles a shareholder to vote.
- l Preferential Shares priority shares at a fixed rate of dividend
- l Deferred Shares fixed rate shares of founders given from remaining profit after paying the ordinary shares and priority shares
- l Debentures loans taken by the company from shareholders against a fixed interest rate. They do not constitute the stock of the company.

Worlds largest Hotels: The  chart  below  gives  the  magnitude  of  hotels  by  the  number  of rooms. It is significant that 17 hotels in the top twenty are from Las Vegas with large investments in properties. They are expected to have 40,000 rooms by 2010 rivaled only by hotels in Dubai which will be only 400 rooms short in the same period. Las Vegas rakes in $ 36.7 billion in tourism cash each year with 37 million annual guests. It also holds 22,000 conventions and tradeshows each year which alone bring 6 million visitors and delegates each year. It will be a long while before any other city on the planet will catch up with Las Vegas.

## Pricing Plans

Pricing plans is another way to classify hotels. The plans are:

- l European Plan

Room charges only

- l American Plan

Room + all meals

- l Modified American Plan

Room + Breakfast

+ Lunch or dinner

- l Continental Plan

Room + Continental

Breakfast

- l Bed &amp; Breakfast

Room + English BF

Downtown hotels prefer offering the European Plan as guests come on short stays and want the flexibility of meals. We had said that downtown hotels are close to business, shopping and entertainment districts which offer ample dining options to the guests. The guests would like to avail these options as they get a chance to experience the city. The American Plan is often found at resorts where vacationers prefer to have all the meal options so that they can concentrate on holidaying  and  relaxing.  We  may  have  this  plan  at  suburban  hotels  that  gear  themselves  for training programmes, seminars and conferences. Participants may prefer to concentrate on their study than be worried about where to get the next meal. The Modified American Plan is found in hotels that cater to tour groups who like to start the day with a hearty breakfast before proceeding on their sightseeing tours, only to return in the evening for a warm dinner. The Continental Plan is found in Europe mostly. It is suitable for European travellers visiting other countries, who are used to continental breakfasts. Bed and Breakfast meal option is offered by sole proprietors running small lodging places or city hotels where guests prefer the flexibility of eating out with friends and office colleagues.

For housekeeping professionals to understand, a Continental breakfast consists of a choice of breads, preserves like jam, honey and marmalade, tea or coffee. An English breakfast will

have a juice, cereals, toasts, choice of eggs, preserved meats like bacon, ham or sausage, and tea or coffee. An American breakfast will have all the ingredients of an English breakfast plus pancakes with syrup.

## Type of Clientele

Type of clientele is another way to categorise hotels. This category enables the hotel to specialise on a type of clientele as against those that are geared for multi-guest profiles.

- l Business Hotel
- l Group Hotel
- l Family Hotel
- l Convention Hotel
- l Youth Hostels

Business Hotels will specialise in providing facilities and amenities to the business and corporate traveller. The business traveller is

<!-- image -->

one who owns a business while corporate travellers are paid professionals. Facilities in a business hotel  include  business  centres  that  provide  meeting  rooms,  secretarial  services  and  modern telecommunication facilities including the internet. The business centres are equipped with modern office automation. A business lounge allows executives to have private food and beverages and will  have  the  latest  newspapers  and  perhaps  a  library.  The  rooms  of  business  hotels  will  be equipped  with  high-speed  internet  facilities,  direct  dial  telecommunication  link-up  globally, ergonomic writing desks and chairs, a mini-bar, safety lockers, multi-channel television etc. Services could include limousine service to and from the airport, concierge service, same day laundry service, health club, access to golf courses, etc.

Group Hotels are geared for volume traffic at  any given time. Their lobbies are large to welcome  groups;  they  have  separate registration  counters;  they  also  have  a  lobby staff equipped to handle volume baggage; they have separate baggage elevators; rooms that are all twin-bedded; large dining halls to seat several groups at a time; and briefing rooms for tour groups. They may not have all the frills that are there in the rooms of a business hotel because  such  additional  facilities  could  be misused. The hotel will have facilities for the handicapped, medical services for the aged and infant care.

<!-- image -->

Family  Hotels are  found  mostly  at  resorts  geared  specifically  for  families.  Rooms  will  be interconnected  with  perhaps  a  kitchenette  and  basic  cooking  facilities.  There  would  be entertainment lounges equipped with television, indoor games and childrens play area. Many would have outdoor children-parks, jogging-paths and independent barbeque areas.

<!-- image -->

Convention  Hotels would  firstly  have plenary  halls,  smaller  meeting  rooms, administration offices, large registration areas and  large  dining  halls  to  feed  upto  2000 people.  The  rooms  would  be  mostly  twinbedded  with  modern  telecommunication systems,  mini-bars,  safety  lockers,  etc.  The hotels will have shuttle coach services from the hotel to the airport and the city centre to transport delegates.

Youth Hostels cater to travelling youth. The hostels will have dormitory style accommodation  and  maybe  some  single rooms for those who want to have a room all

for themselves. Hostels will have common toilets and shower areas, large dining halls with simple food, gymnasium, games courts and fields. They may be equipped with an assembly hall with a stage for youth gatherings and entertainment. The Y.M.C.A. hostels are the best example of this type.

## Length of Stay

Length of stay is another classification where hotels specially gear themselves according to short term and long term stay of guests.

- l Transient Hotel
- l Residential Hotel
- l Semi-residential

Transient Hotels are those where guests stay for a short  duration  which  could  be  at  the  maximum  of  a week. Downtown hotels, Motels and Airport hotels are good  examples  of  transient  hotels.  Guests  need  a comfortable  room  with  possibly  in-  room  tea/coffee facilities.

Residential Hotels are those that are equipped for a longer stay of the guests. Hotel Apartments are a good example of this and are found in many community hotel complexes. The rooms will be suites consisting of two roomsone a living area and the other a bedroom. The  suites  are  fitted  with  kitchenettes  for  personal cooking.  The  rooms  are  cleaned  by  an  outsourced housekeeping service. The complex will have security

<!-- image -->

service with pass-keys to enter the building at night. Guests may lease this accommodation for any length of time upto a year. These hotels are convenient for long tenure business executives who do not want the hassle of running a home. These are ideal in university campus locations for mature students who have families.

Suite Hotels are similar to residential hotels with shorter stay of perhaps six months or less. It is ideal for families who need a temporary accommodation before moving into their permanent abode. Professionals find it convenient to set up travelling offices in their living area without intruding into the bedroom. They would have all the facilities and amenities of the residential hotel except that they may have a coffee shop, bar and perhaps, one more specialty restaurant.

<!-- image -->

Most  lodging  investors  nowadays  are  opting  for  Suite Hotels.

Furnished Apartments are another variation of extended stay properties. The rooms are studio with open, fully equipped  kitchens.  Such  hotels  will  have  reception counters,  lobbies  for  meeting  visitors,  outsourced housekeeping  services  and  a  swimming  pool  and gymnasium. They may have Laundromats in the basement. They will not have eating facilities except for some vending machines. Furnished apartments would have close-circuit television for security. A receptionist acts as a caretaker, security guard, cleaner of public areas and guest relations person who rooms guests. The apartments would have a

47

plumber and an electrician in a full-time role. Between them they operate all the utility services including water supplies, central air-conditioning, central-heating, and swimming pool maintenance. These apartments are ideal for single professionals who do not want the hassle of running a home.

## Facilities Offered

Facilities offered by hotels are another way to classify them.

- n Star rating
- n Deluxe Hotels
- n Palace Hotels
- n Convention Hotels
- n Conference Hotels
- n Casino Hotels
- n Business Hotels
- n Sports Hostels
- n Budget Hotels
- n Suite Hotels
- n Bed and Breakfast
- n Time-share
- n Condominiums

Star Rating is one of the most definitive standards which guide travellers as to what to expect. The star ratings are organised by the State Tourism Department who puts together a team of representatives from the government, hospitality educationists, travel agents, airlines and the hotel industry. They are guided by a checklist of minimum requirements to achieve a certain star. The owner of the property will inform the tourism department of the star rating they aspire for and will set a date for the inspection. Star Ratings range from one to five-star though there are even six and seven stars which are outside the purview of this chapter as these properties are rare. A five-star rating, for instance, will specify that rooms are of certain minimum dimensions with attached bathrooms supplying hot and cold water. The bathrooms must have bathtubs. A five-star hotel will have a shopping arcade with a bank, post office, travel agency etc. They must have a coffee shop and other dining options. It is necessary for them to have a swimming pool, room service etc. From those high standards of investment the hotel rating reduces as hotels provide lesser facilities. Hotels are required to display their star rating at the main portal of the hotel so that the guest can know what standard to expect.

Deluxe Hotels would  normally  have  a  minimum  five-star  rating.  These  hotels  are  rated  as deluxe as they would have décor and appointments of luxury. They would have every conceivable comfort built into the guest experience. Take Burj-al-Arab in Dubai where accommodations are suites that overlook the Persian Gulf. The rooms are fitted with remote control window shades, gold plated taps, etc. Guests are transported to the hotel from the airport by the hotel helicopter that lands on a helipad on the hotel rooftop.  It has a restaurant under the sea as well as one at the roof top that gives breathtaking aerial views. Deluxe hotels ooze opulence and are available only to those moneyed people who can afford the stay. Some deluxe business hotels provide individual

48

butlers and specialised cuisines. Many older stand alone hotels like the Ambassador hotel or The Claridges in Delhi set standards of luxury. Many palaces, mansions and villas of the royalty of yore have been converted from lodgings into hotels which really cannot be given a star rating for their uniqueness but may certainly be classified as deluxe.

Palace  Hotels are  really  an  Indian  concept  where ancient Indian maharajas converted their palaces into hotels  after  they  were  stripped  off  their  princely privileges. The palaces transport guests into old heritage, architecture  and  priceless  appointments.  The  Umaid Bhavan Palace in Jodhpur for example boasts of a crystal fountain in the lobby and an array of vintage cars in the private garage complex. The beds in which the guests sleep  are  those  where  actual  royalty  once  slept.  Of course, these palaces have been equipped with modern conveniences  such  as  television,  mini-fridges,  air-

<!-- image -->

conditioning and telephone connections though these things intrude into the original uniqueness of the property. Guests are exposed to rare art and artifacts that are not found anywhere else in the world. A similar concept may be found in Europe where manor houses of the royalty have been converted into luxury accommodation. They are also called Heritage Hotels nowadays.

Convention Hotels are specially designed for such purposes. They have a plenary hall to seat 2000 people, breakout meeting rooms for smaller groups, administrative offices providing all the secretarial,  office  automation  facilities,  ample  registration  lobbies  and  large  dining  halls.  The plenary hall and meeting rooms have state-of-the-art projection and public communications systems required for conventions. Most of the rooms will be twin-bedded to be used as single and twin rooms for delegates.

Conference Hotels would have similar facilities as convention hotels but scaled down in size. Many hotels may have conference centres attached to their main hotel to have the flexibility for business, tourist and conference business. The conference annexes will have independent entrances and large parking lots. Some conference hotels may also include auditoriums that are leased out for public shows.

<!-- image -->

Casino Hotels serve only one purposeto serve guests who want to gamble. Las Vegas in Nevada, U.S.A is the best example of the location of casino hotels each more dramatic than the other. The essential features of casino hotels are gaming halls sometimes the size of a football field with all possible gambling games including  banks  of  slot  machines,  Blackjack tables, roulettes tables, etc.

Each hotel outdoes each other in terms of features and entertainment. Hotel New York boasts of a lobby that represents a New York street  with  street  cafes,  steam  from  sewers,

## LESSON  1 Overview

street lamps leading to the gambling floor; MGM boasts of a sunken bar on the style of the Brazilian rain forest; Treasure Island has a sound and light show of a pirate ship being sunk while Bellagios has dancing fountains that are a unique sight; Caesars Palace has all its staff  dressed in Roman Togas and boasts of amphitheatres where famous modern day stars perform; The bar is a Roman Galleon built in the lobby itself. With such funds, casino hotels are truly deluxe with the best facilities to meet practically every guests need. Most rooms

are large and fitted with twin-queen-sized beds with bathrooms with separate bathing, shower and toilet areas. A bathroom would perhaps be the size of a guest room in a smaller property!

Business Hotels are  specifically  built  in  structure  and  facilities  to  cater  to  the  business  and corporate clients. This type of hotels has been explained in detail earlier in the chapter.

Sports Hostels and Hotels may go back to the time of the Olympic Games in 776 B.C. when the Greek empire was at its height. The games started in Olympia about 18 kilometers from Pirgos, Greece. While Olympia was covered by earthquakes and floods, later excavations showed that the complex had a wrestling and boxing school, gymnasium and dormitories for athletes to stay. Olympic Games were held every four years. In recent times, these games have been split into  Winter  Olympics  (in  1994)  and  Summer  Olympics.  The  holding  of  the  Olympics  is  the responsibility of a state which provides them with funds for complex games villages that carefully segregates national teams and provides them with independent gymnasiums, practice fields and large dining halls to cater to different cuisines. The games villages have special security, medical rooms, dope-testing facilities including a number of administrative features. Rooms are dormitories with common bathrooms for athletes and individual rooms for officials. Nowadays, sport has become an industry that earns mega bucks from television rights, sponsorships and large gate money. Games like soccer, basketball, cricket, rugby, tennis, football etc. have become multimillion dollar industries pulling huge crowds. Events like World Cups and championships have made investment into these games a lucrative proposition. Purpose-built sports hostels and hotels are built  at  popular  stadiums  to  accommodate athletes and spectators of the sport. Essential features of these accommodations are gymnasiums, health clubs, swimming pools, large dining halls, facilities such as doctors specialised in sports medicine, special security to protect rampaging fans reaching their sports idols, dieticians for special diets for sportsmen and sportswomen, trainers etc.

Budget hotels are relatively a new concept that makes travel inexpensive in a world that is getting more and more costly. Budget hotels strip rooms and services to the bare minimum and use automation to fulfil many guest needs. A room would have bunker beds with perhaps a sink in the room for washing purposes. There would be common toilets. A mini-television will be mounted on the wall to save space. Budget hotels will have dispensers for hot and cold foods, ice, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, toiletries etc. located at common areas on the floors or lobbies. Many motels have built these facilities into their way of operations.

Suite Hotels cater to those who need more room. Such facilities are found in deluxe properties or family resort hotels. They would have all the other facilities of a modern hotel. Suite hotels have been discussed in detail earlier in the lesson.

Bed and Breakfast establishments are usually small family businesses. A family may have an extra set of rooms in their home that they let out to tourists. This is a typical concept from Europe which perhaps earlier did not have welldeveloped hotel facilities. Ireland and Scotland, for example, supplement hotel accommodation in  the  huge  tourist  season  with  bed  and breakfast  properties.  The  family  of  the establishment  takes  the  responsibility  of providing  comfortable  rooms  much  in  the home style with their dining rooms serving as

<!-- image -->

the breakfast venue. Breakfast would be sumptuous English breakfasts with a full array of cereals, meats, breads and tea and coffee. These breakfasts are legendary and many travellers could sustain a full day till the evening on this meal.

<!-- image -->

Time-Share Hotels are relatively a new concept of ownership of holiday rooms or suites.  Each room or suite is owned by several people  who  will  schedule  their  visit  well  in  advance  with  the management office to ensure that the room or suite is available. Time-Share  properties  are  located  at  dream  sites  normally  at beaches, ski slopes, hill resorts, waterfalls, spas, etc. People book time for a week to a fortnight. Should they not be free to avail the room for any reason, they can rent their time slot to another person. Sometimes the management company can help in this process. One great advantage of time-share process is that time-share owners can become members of international time-share properties and exchange their  time  with  another  time-share  owner  at  another location.  Time-share  properties  have  fully-furnished  rooms  with kitchenettes. They may have a dining hall with a bar. They outsource

recreation expertise such as guides, boatmen, ski instructors, Para-gliding specialists, etc.

Condominiums (or  Condos) are another type of accommodation. Here the owner of a unit, which is a room or apartment in a complex of  several  such  accommodations,  furnishes  it  to  his/her  taste  and informs  the  management  of  the  times  when  s/he  will  occupy  the apartment. S/he permits the management to rent out the apartment at other times and the rent goes to the owner. Condos have restricted entry. Owners have their own password to enter the premises. These passwords are given to lessees of their property. Owners pay a monthly or  annual maintenance fee that covers cleaning of common areas; central  air-conditioning/heating  maintenance;  landscaping  and gardening;  water  supply;  security  and  garbage  disposal.  Condo management which is appointed by the owners association may lease space to a grocery store in the basement to provide the basic needs of the residents of condos.

## Other Lodging Innovations

Caravans are  mobile  homes  that  families  take  across  the  country.  Caravans  are  fitted  with sleeping, dining, lounge and bathroom facilities. They have tanks with fresh water and septic tanks for refuse. Some caravans have kitchenettes with basic heating facilities. As discussed before, caravans are moored at camping sites constructed just for this purpose.

Rotels are double-decker buses where passengers sit on ergo-planned seats on the ground deck and sleep on the upper deck. Such buses are used for long cross-country tours covering fifteen days or more. The second floor has tiered berths fitted with bed-side lamps, toilet shelf and privacy  curtains.  Buses  are  fitted  with  bathrooms  much  like  that  found  in  an  aeroplane  and kitchens have a chef to cook the food. The buses are fitted with heating and/or air-conditioning facility. Buses stop at vantage points enroute for meals and accommodation in a hotel for a hot bath. The greatest benefit of such a travel is that guests do not have the hassle of packing and unpacking. They are provided with cupboards on board. Rotels were introduced by Conti Hotel Bus Company of Germany.

Matels are fully automated hotels which require minimum human contact. A guest books on-line and gets an immediate confirmation. On arrival, he punches in his reservation number and name in a machine which initiates a dialogue with a virtual receptionist who registers the guest through a close-circuit TV and issues a key to the room through a slot machine. Outsourced cleaning crews come during the day to clean the room and make it fresh and impeccably clean. This concept was started in Japan and is likely to be the future of hotels.

Sanatoria are found at spas and other health resorts. The rooms are specifically equipped for therapy including sauna, Turkish bath and Jacuzzi. Meals are peronalised diet regimes for each guest. These hotels have proper dieticians, doctors and medical arrangements. This is ideal for those recouping from surgeries and illnesses. It is also a place for attaining physical fitness.

Palace on Wheels is a unique railway journey recreating the journeys of the maharajas of India. It is a tour from New Delhi, India to the historic sights in Rajasthan including forts, palaces and cultural attractions. The guests are fed traditional Indian food of royalty and served by liveried waiting staff.

Government Houses are a composite name for Dak Bungalows, Circuit Houses, PWD Houses and Forest Lodges which are the legacy of the British Raj in India. These were primarily built for government officials during the administrative tours. Dak Bungalows were meant for the postal couriers to rest while circuit houses were for the higher ranked officials. Forest Lodges were built for those involved in Forestry and building the winter capitals of the Raj.  The PWD houses were for those officials involved in road building and laying electricity power lines. These establishments have caretakers drawn from local villages who are multi-skilled to cook, clean and provide security to the establishment. They are trained to give the standards required by the officials and are very capable. These establishments are still available to government personnel and authorised public.

Floating Hotels are those found on passenger ships. Some are permanently docked at a port while  others  are  cruise  liners  taking  passengers  on  a  week  long  trip  around  famed  locations connected with water. The ships are five star hotels with every conceivable luxury including several restaurants with multi-cuisine, suites, ball rooms, shopping arcades etc. Guests are served by welltrained and talented personnel. A wonderful variation of this concept is the houseboat of Kashmir.

52

Houseboats are moored on the banks of the lakes and fitted with telephone connections, modern sanitation in bathrooms and the most luxurious appointments and décor. The roof acts as the sun deck while the boat within has a living room, a dining room and several bedrooms. The houseboat is staffed by the owner and his family, cook, clean and do small errands. Shikaras are smaller boats that sidle along the boat for transportation around the lake. Hawkers come alongside the houseboats in their shikaras , to sell their wares. Houseboats are fitted to suit all budgets from the economical to the ultra luxurious.

Hospices have been traditional lodgings in Europe for the Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem. Each religion have their own religious support groups running on charity. For example, the Hokke Club of Japan built specially designed and serviced facilities for the Buddhist pilgrims. They provide meditation centres and monks for prayers. Followers of Islam provide madrassas while Hindus have their Dharmshalas for the pilgrims of their faith.

## Segmentation

A relatively new concept employed by big chains is that they segment their properties into several sub- categories. For example, Marriot Hotels and Resorts have several brands of properties: J.W. Marriot, Mariott Marquis, Marriot Hotels, Marriot Inns, Courtyard by Mariott and Fairfield Inn by Marriot. Even the residential apartments have been further sub-branded as Residence Inn by Mariott, Towne-Place Suites by Mariott and Spring Hill Suites by Mariott. Mariott also owns the Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance brands. Each brand is directed to a specific market segment.

Such a strategy serves the following purposes:

- 1. To serve several distinct market segments
- 2. To enter world locations that may or may not support superior hotels.
- 3. To capture properties worldwide based on emerging opportunities and fund flows.
- 4. To have  price ranges to suit various guest budgets
- 5. To  have  varying  amenities  and  facilities  without  compromising  on  basic  standards  and image of the chain.
- 6. Have all brands benefit from the central reservation system of the hotel chain.

## 1.2 HOTEL CHAIN ASSOCIATIONS

## Introduction

It  is  important for a professional housekeeper to understand hotel chain associations as they could work well for a hotel that belongs to a chain. The culture and work dynamics in chain operations are quite different than those of independent hotel operators. One of the differences, to put it simply, is that housekeepers of a chain have to follow the systems and procedures of the principles while independent hotels evolve their own practices.

A hotel chain is one that has several hotels under the same name located at different geographic locations both domestically and internationally. The concept of hotel chain operations is uniquely American, who built hotel brand names such as the Ramada, Holiday Inns, Sheraton, etc. providing worldwide quality service. The benefit of a strong brand name is that a traveller can expect a certain minimum standard of service from the hotel, under that name, anywhere in the world. International chain operations spread into all continents. Individual entrepreneurs were crushed in  the  race  of  this  multidimensional,  multinational  industry.  International  chains  provided  the expertise, technology, and marketing thrust that individual hotels cannot.

## History of Chain Operations

In 1925, Howard Johnson created the first soda pop fountain in Quincy, Massachusetts. By adding popular foods like hamburgers, hotdogs and sandwiches, he created the first Howard Johnson Restaurant which expanded to 400 restaurants through franchise. The first hotel was commissioned as the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge in Savannah, Georgia, that expanded into many hotels. The hotel chain was acquired by Prime Motor Inns of Fairfield, New Jersey. The restaurant chain which includes the famous Big Boy is now owned by Hardees.

Another famous hotelier, Willard Marriott, started as a restaurateur with A&amp;W fast food restaurant chain in 1928. He entered into the hotel industry in 1940s expanding it into a $5.3 billion Marriott Corporation with segmented hotel chains such as Marriot Hotels, Residence Inns and Courtyard hotels.

In late 1950s another new concept emergedbudget hotels. The budget hotel bought cheap land and offered lodging only. Budget hotels stripped all services like food and beverage, laundry, uniformed housekeeping services to be able to offer a cheap rate. The rooms had no televisions and telephones. The guests sometimes had to rent the bed, linen and blankets for their rooms. The first budget hotel was the Travelodge , Tacoma Washington and it grew into a successful chain throughout North America. Travelodge now has added amenities such as TV and telephones and bed linen as essential to stay in business. Travelodge is now a subsidiary of Trusthouse Forte, a luxury chain in the U.K.

## Relationships

Individual owners could not compete with large hotel chains and, therefore, merged with chains such as Sheraton, Hilton, Hyatt, Holiday Inn, Ramada Inn etc. The international chains provided the following relationships to individual owners:

- (a) Partnership sharing equity and profits.
- (b) Franchise providing name and association against a fee.

- (c) Management Contract providing professional managers, technicians, manuals, systems, etc on the basis of management fees and a share of profits as incentive payment.

In most cases, the sub-staff are all locally hired to save labor cost. They are trained according to the standards of the chain. The Executive Housekeeper can be an employee of the chain based on the association. Local hired housekeepers have the privilege of consulting chain housekeeping specialists.

Let us look at each of these associations in detail.

## Partnership

A partnership occurs when a chain and an independent investor jointly finance a hotel project. In such cases, both become owners of the property and bring to the table their individual expertise and talents. They share in the profits and liabilities on an equal basis.

Another arrangement that is popular nowadays is the straight lease agreement. A hotel chain reviews a property built by an investor who then leases the property to the chain on an annual lease  bases.  The  owner  becomes  a  landlord  and  does  not  interfere  in  the  operations  of  the property. The chain becomes the tenant and is responsible for all the taxes and recurring municipal fees paid from the operations.

Another arrangement is the sale of a property by a chain and then the chain leases it back from the new owner under a lease basis, management contract or franchise arrangement. Chains opt for  this  when  they  want  capital  funds  for  other  projects  or  when  they  want  to  reduce  direct investment as a strategy.

The professional housekeeper has to understand the arrangements between the partners. What has to be known is the role of each partner especially the one accountable for day-today operations. The General Manager provides such clarifications. It is also important to know the systems and procedures adopted by the hotel as also the standards to be maintained. Many a time the Executive Housekeeper has also to advise the owners on the best practice and convince them about budgetary expenditure.

## Franchise

A franchise is a license given by a franchisor to a franchisee who can be an individual, partners, a small corporation or a group of investors.  The question arises why an organisation would like to take a franchise. Firstly, a franchise is given by an organisation that has over the years developed a worldwide brand name of consistent quality. A guest will know exactly what to expect from a brand name. Especially in a foreign travel, the guests are circumspect of the standards of the unknown properties. A known brand name immediately gives comfort to the guest. Secondly, a franchise generates large revenues through referral business. For example, all Holiday Inns in the world  become  sales  persons  for  the  franchisee  in  a  location.  Thirdly,  franchisors  have  their established central reservation systems to give leads to travellers worldwide about a franchised hotel.

A similar question can be posed of the Franchisor. Why does he give a franchise? Doesnt the organisation run the risk of losing its reputation? The truth is that a franchise is the fastest way to expand overseas. Captive investments are expensive for any individual corporation to finance. Secondly, any new franchisee becomes a new salesperson in a location for the other franchised

<!-- image -->

properties of the chain. Thirdly, Franchise fees demanded by the franchisor from the franchisee generate big sums of revenue without direct investments.

The franchisee  is  given  a  license  to  use  the  franchisors  concept  of  business,  methods  of operations and name. Both parties sign a franchise agreement which is a contract that spells out the obligations of both parties. One important aspect of the agreement is that the franchisee is required to maintain the qualitystandards of the franchisor. Quality-standards include:

- 1. Building materials
- 2. Heating or air-conditioning
- 3. Size of guest rooms
- 4. Type of décor and materials used
- 5. Minimum type of trained professional staff required
- 6. Hours of operation
- 7. Hygiene and cleanliness standards
- 8. Procedures for service

## Franchisors provide the following:

- 1. Site selection expertise and architectural design
- 2. Interior design
- 3. Central purchasing and economies of scale especially of equipment and service ware.
- 4. Systems and procedures manuals.
- 5. Global marketing
- 6. Worldwide corporate advertising
- 7. Merchandising material
- 8. Use of logos on local advertising and merchandising
- 9. Use of logos on service ware.
- 10. Central reservation system (separate fee for this)
- 11. Training programmes
- 12. A regional manager who supervises the standards of operations and provides technical support.
- 13. Audits and inspections.
- 14. Credit or finding finance

The franchisee gives an initial franchise fee and gets in turn the permission to use the trademark name, designs, systems and procedures manuals and consultancy. Thereafter the franchisee gives a monthly royalty, based on following possible terms:

- 1. A percentage of room revenue in the case of hotels or food and beverage sales in the case of restaurants.
- 2. A percentage of total sales
- 3. A fixed monthly fee
- 4. A fixed monthly fee plus an amount for each room reserved by central reservations
- 5. A fixed amount per available room
- 6. A fixed amount per occupied room

The housekeeping professional under this type of association is required to be trained in the systems and procedures of the franchisor. They are specially required to understand and execute the minimum standards set by the franchisor . Such guidelines come in the form of procedural manuals which become the way things are done in the housekeeping department. The titles used for various positions are also stipulated by the franchisor . There can be no deviations from set procedures and the house keeping department is subject to annual inspections and audit by the Franchisor, who ensures that the procedures are followed as prescribed.

## Management Contract

A management contract is entered into by a chain and an individual hotel owner. The owner opts for a management contract to get international recognition, international expertise and a profitable operation. Sometimes the owner is not fully proficient in the art of running the hotel and prefers to hire experts who can bring his/her operation to international standards. S/he may opt for international chain management because s/he cannot get such expertise locally. The chain sends specialists like the General Manager, Food and Beverage Manager, Executive Chef, Executive Housekeeper and Rooms Division Manager. All sub-staff will be hired locally and trained by the chains corporate trainer. The owner becomes the dormant partner in operational matters and only interferes when finances are exceeding budget. All operational expenses are borne by the owner.

The management fees under a contract can be as follows:

- 1. A fixed percentage of net income. The amount would be from 3% to 8% of revenues.
- 2. A fixed percentage on gross operating profit that allows the owner to charge operating expenses at will especially local advertising costs, but has to run the operation profitably. This could range from 15% to 25%.
- 3. A combination of both which can be 3% to 5% of income and 5% to 10% of gross operating profit.

The arrangement is confirmed through a management contract that stipulates the following:

- 1. The management fee structure and the schedule of payment.
- 2. The number of experts hired by the owner.
- 3. The cost of the experts paid in hard currency at the standard of international salaries.
- 4. That the chain management are only agents of the owner and not liable for any litigation.
- 5. The chain can provide expertise in architecture, interior design, facility planning, engineers, consultants and project managers whose fees are paid by the owner from the project budgets.
- 6. Such project specialists shall be on-site when required especially when critical equipments are installed.
- 7. To provide pre-opening services like recruitment, training, promotion and publicity, selection of suppliers, procurement of licenses and permits for various services and planning and execution of the inauguration.
- 8. The owner provides cash flows for daily operations.
- 9. The owner bears all operational expenses.

Under this association, the housekeeping professionals receive guidelines and instructions from the resident representative of the chain. The representative of the chain is a fulltime employee. Housekeepers can get their guidance from the professional in the area such as the  Executive  Housekeeper, Accommodations Manager or the General Manager who is appointed by the chain. Chains with a large presence in a region may have area housekeepers, regional  housekeepers  or  corporate  housekeepers  to  give  training  and  guidance  on housekeeping matters.

## Summary

Professional housekeepers working in a chain must know the type of relationship that they have with the chain. This understanding confirms the type of standards to follow and where to get guidance on housekeeping matters.

## 1.3 ORGANISATION OF A HOTEL

## Mission

Every organisation has a reason for being in business. All its managers and staff must be coordinated to fulfil that purpose. The purpose is enunciated by the owners of the business in the form of a mission statement. A mission statement is a generalized statement of the overriding purpose of the business. Jack Welsh, ex-CEO of GM, in his book Winning translated it as How do we intend to win in this business. The mission is the strategic intent which is the desired future state or aspiration of the organisation. All stakeholders need to be clear about what they are seeking to achieve and in broad terms, how it is expected to be achieved. The mission statement expresses the philosophy of the property. Take the following as an example of a mission statement of a business hotel:

Our mission is to provide safe and comfortable board and lodging to our business clients. We shall provide all that is necessary to make a business person fulfil his or her needs during business travel through research and participation. We emphasize high quality in products and services. We shall give a fair return to our shareholders through innovation, training and a motivated work force.

## Values

Values are the behaviours that are required to be exhibited by the entire hotel team to achieve the mission. They are the means to the end. Everyone is involved in setting the values. These need to be discussed and written down as value statements that will ultimately translate into the culture of the organisation. Some values are listed below to fulfil the mission stated above:

- l Provide prompt service
- l Give guests privacy
- l Keep any conversation overheard confidential
- l Ensure that all communication technology is in working order always
- l Bring in the latest technology
- l Innovate or die
- l Every hotel member is a salesperson
- l Teamwork can exceed all expectations
- l Smile always
- l Be helpful to guests
- l Provide the best in luxury
- l Get guest feedback continuously
- l We shall work to give shareholders a good return
- l People are our greatest asset so we shall look  after them

## Objectives and Goals

From the mission statement and values flow the specific objectives and goals to achieve the mission. While objectives are long term aspirations, goals are short term aspirations. Good goals follow SMART which is an acronym for:

- S  Specific
- M  Measurable
- A  Accountability
- R  Reasonable
- T  Time bound

Goals are of two types: Strategic Objectives which are long term goals; and Tactical Goals which are short term in nature. Objectives and goals are reflected in formal plan as how they are to be achieved (action plan); when they are to be achieved; and who is accountable to achieve it. We will see in Lesson 1.5  What is Management? that goals or objectives are set at the planning stage. There are Perspective Plans (5-10 years or more), Long Term Plans (3-5 years), Short Term Plans and Annual Plans (1 year) and Budgets (financial outlays to achieve plans).

While the corporate management is concerned with perspective and long term plans, the Executive Housekeeper is concerned with short term and Annual Plans. Typical goals for the housekeeping department would be:

- l Reduce turnover time of departure rooms by 5 minutes.
- l Achieve a cost reduction by 10% in the budget year.
- l Train 10% staff in computer skills in six months.
- l Reduce the number of guest complaints by 20% from the last year.

## Structures of an Organisation

The success of a hotel operation depends on the way it is organised to achieve its goals. Organisation starts with a structure. A structure is a framework which assigns responsibilities and channels of communication to drive decision-making and operational accountabilities. This is represented in an organisation chart. An organisation chart is the schematic depiction of relationships between various  job  positions  in  an  organisation.  Most  establishments  follow  a  traditional  hierarchal organisation structure that has evolved over the ages. We have management at the top, supervisors in the middle and operational staff at the bottom as shown in Fig. 1.1.

Managers are responsible for the effective utilization of the traditional resources of men (human resources), materials (operating supplies), money (budgets and finances) and machines (equipment), etc. to achieve organisational goals. (Please see Lesson 1.5  What is Management?  for greater details on resources) Managers are categorised as:

Top Management: They are responsible for the long term and perspective plans (5-10 years), funding and strategic objectives of the organisation. They would typically be the Owner, Board of Directors of a public limited company, Functional Directors and the General Manager. It would be pertinent that the Corporate Housekeeper and the Director, Housekeeping will fall under this category.

Middle Management: They lead specific functions in an operation like, the Food and Beverage Manager, Front-Office Manager, Chef, Executive Housekeeper, etc. They make the Short-term and annual plans (1-3 years) for their respective departments.

Junior Management: lead the day-to-day activities of the operations relying on their management and  technical  skills.  They  ensure  that  the  policies  and  practices  translate  themselves  at  the

Fig. 1.1 Traditional Hierarchical Organisation Structure

<!-- image -->

operational  level.  They  would  be  the  Lobby  Manager,  Telecommunications  Manager,  Guest Relations Executive, and in housekeeping, the Assistant Housekeeper.

Supervisors are the link between the management and the operational staff at the floor level, to ensure that the resources allocated are effectively utilized. They are the face of the management to the guest who recognizes him/her as the team leader. They are the Floor Supervisor, Public Area Supervisor, Control Desk Supervisor and the Linen and Uniform Room Supervisor.

Operations personnel are  the  frontline  and  back  office  performers  of  operations  and  rely heavily on technical and customer service skills. They would typically be the room attendants, housemen, gardeners, etc.

The proportion of skills required at each level is illustrated in Fig. 1.2.

Fig. 1.2 Work Focus

## Corporate Chain Structures

Large corporate chain operations like the Sheraton, Holiday Inns, Intercontinental, Ramada etc. have elaborate  structures  as  shown  below  in  Fig.  1.3.  The  structure  begins  with  a  Board  of Directors who represents the shareholders. Their responsibility is to give strategic, financial and policy decisions that act as guidelines for action on a long-term basis. They appoint a Chief

Fig. 1.3 Corporate Structure of a Chain Operation

<!-- image -->

Executive Officer (CEO) who is the intermediary between the Board of Directors and the Operational structure below. The President is the head of all operations of the chain. He appoints Regional Vice Presidents who cover geographic regions of the chain operation. International chains would have Regional Vice Presidents for North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, South Asia, Far East and the Pacific. Regions may be clubbed based on the number of units in the region. Each Regional Vice President would have Area Directors/Managers to oversee operations within a group of countries or states within a larger continent. They would directly control Country Managers, if a country has multiple units to warrant one or General Managers/Managers of independent units.

## Other Structures of Corporate Chains

There are other ways of looking at structures of corporate chain operations as illustrated below:

## SuperstructureGrouping by Divisions

## Divisions

- l Grouping by Functions would mean that each department would operate as an independent function such as Marketing, Operations, Human Resources, etc. This has been the usual structure of present day operations of a corporate chain.

<!-- image -->

- l Grouping by Product is done when a corporate business has more than one product. A chain may be in the business of premium hotels, mid-size hotels and budget hotels. Each product could have its own structure and chain of command. Grouping can also be done by business hotels, resorts and group hotels.
- l Grouping by Process involves segregating the whole operation by the process. E.g. business set-up, operations, business promotion.

The grouping above is analysed below:

- l Specialists of one area may have difficulty relating to another area
- l Can control the introduction of new technology
- l Strikes in one area can hold up the whole production

## Flat Structures

The modern mantra in organisation structures is to keep it lean and flat. They have made this possible by removing several layers like middle management and junior management who did the processing work of information. Computers today have taken this role and are generating valuable reports for decision-making, instantly and accurately. A typical flat structure is given in Fig. 1.4:

The flat structure may seem very disconcerting to the traditionalist. However, all organisations are moving to this direction. What we see is an inverted pyramid which implies that the frontline staff, headed by team leaders, is the king and supported by the specialists and top management. The main objective of flat structures is to be less bureaucratic and push decision-making at the

customer contact end. It recognizes that it is the frontline people like front office agents, restaurant servers and room attendants, who make the revenues and control costs and therefore, need to be put in their right perspective.  The New Housekeeping Professional  in the Introduction tells us that the frontline staff has been empowered with authority and decision-making powers enjoyed by their supervisors and junior management before. For example, frontline staff can now make decisions such as providing additional room amenities to a regular customer or offering additional blankets and bathrobes to a guest, if they believe that action will improve sales and create repeat customers. Naturally, the front-line staff will have be more qualified and trained to hold such responsibilities. They become knowledge workers who serve the customer with superior knowledge of products and services.

The specialists sole purpose is to enhance the performance of frontline staff by providing specialist support and advisory services. They receive first hand feedback from the front-line staff and convert it into better performance. Specialists are IT professionals, trainers, quality inspectors, corporate housekeepers, corporate chef, corporate human resource director, etc.

The top  management will  not  interfere  in  operations  and  will  concentrate  on  strategic directions. Typical roles will include strategic planning, raising finance, mergers and acquisitions, influencing government regulation, monitoring financial and human performance and setting such policies that fulfil the objectives of flat structures.

## Job titles

Job titles have changed to rightly represent knowledge workers. The erstwhile receptionist has grown into a front office agent, the room attendant has been re-titled as Floor Host, waiters as hosts, information assistants have converted into the concierge. Hotels are battling to redefine titles to properly represent the expanded roles of frontline staff. The frontline staff needs to be recognized and respected by the guests who must perceive the job-enriched-roles the people who serve them have to provide them with that perfect guest experience.

## Line versus Staff functions

Line functions are those that execute the work in an organisation. They can either have direct contacts with guests like floor supervisors, room attendants, etc. or those that provide back-house

support like the telecommunications personnel, control desk attendant, etc. Both front and back offices have significant impacts on direct revenues of the unit.

Staff functions are those specialists in their fields. They are support personnel to ensure the operations run smoothly as per the standards set by the establishment. Some staff functions are:

Human Resources Specialists who specialise in recruitment, orientation, salary administration, staff welfare and career guidance.

Financial Controllers who help interpret financial statements and guide line managers in better decision making. They look after the cost of food and beverages operations and budgets.

Accountants take stock of revenues and expenditures on a daily basis and work towards providing important statements like the profit and loss statement and the balance sheet. Incidentally, restaurant cashiers who come under this department may be considered as line staff as they are right there in the middle of operations.

Lawyers give legal advice on operations especially when laws are different in many countries. For example, Middle-East may have strict rules against the service of alcoholic beverages, while Europe may have strict laws on smoking and environment. Labour laws are vastly different in different countries especially in those which employ expatriate staff due to non-availability of skills locally.

Interior Designers who help in designing attractive lobbies, rooms, banquets, etc.

Facility Planners help design physical facilities restaurants, kitchens and laundries of a hotel to local and international standards.

Trainers who help employees reach the standards of service of the property as also keep them updated on new developments.

Safety Experts have joined the ranks of modern operations to safeguard the property and guests from all safety hazards, including fire safety, food safety, etc.

Information Technology experts are the new specialists that have pervaded every modern operation that depends on computer based technology.

Food Technologists are a new breed of employees who pursue research and development to produce new food products and better ways to preserve food. They keep the establishment ahead of competition.

## Large Independent Hotel Structure

Large hotel operations require more people to operate it compared to smaller ones. The amount of specializations also increases and therefore, requires an elaborate structure (Fig. 1.5). The structure  below is  a  representative  one  and  can  be  modified  according  to  the  policies  of  the enterprise.

## Small Hotel Structure

Smaller hotels would have many functions above done by fewer people requiring multiple skills. The organisation structure  in  Fig.  1.6  shows  how  a  structure  is  pruned  to  fit  limited  payroll budgets.

70

Fig. 1.6 Management Organisation Structure of a Small Hotel

<!-- image -->

In small hotels, the General Manager takes on the roles of Human Resources Manager and Sales Manager in addition to the operations responsibilities. The Front Office Supervisor overseas the front desk operations as well as lobby activities. The Dining Room Supervisor oversees the kitchen and dining room operations. The housekeeper takes on the roles of the floor supervisors or the housekeeping control desk supervisor. It is significant that small operations would have limited  restaurant  options,  possibly  only  a  dining  room  that  serves  meals  at  all  times.  The housekeeper would then have limited public areas to clean. The Accountant takes over the income and payable responsibilities in addition to producing the statutory requirements such as Profit and Loss statements and Balance Sheets. He is assisted by the Purchase Clerk who doubles the receiving  and  store  function.  Though  this  is  strictly  not  ideal  in  terms  of  food  and  beverage control, the operations is small enough for direct supervision and control of the Accountant. The Food and Beverage Cost Clerk will do all the costing functions. It is possible that the dining room has a dispensing bar to provide drinks eliminating the need for a formal bar. The engineering supervisor is multi-skilled to troubleshoot engineering problems. However, any operation requires specialists like air-conditioning and heating mechanics and plumbers. Most other services would be outsourced, such as laundry, horticulture, civil works etc.

A hotel  has  two  major  revenue  producing  departments(1)  Accommodations,  which  is responsible for the sale of rooms and the support departments such as housekeeping, laundry, telecommunications etc. required to make them saleable, and (2) Food and Beverage, which is responsible for the sale of food and beverage and the service departments such as kitchens, stewarding, restaurants, room service and banquets responsible for their sale. In addition, there are staff departments like Finance, Human Resources, Sales and Marketing, and Information Technology. We need to make another distinction between divisions and departments. Simply put, a division is a grouping of related departments. A department is an independent activity within a division. We, therefore, have the Accommodations division which would typically have front office, lobby, housekeeping, laundry, business centre, health club, etc. departments. The Food and Beverage Division would have restaurants, bars, room service, banquets, kitchens, kitchen stewarding, etc. A department can be stand alone also like Human Resources. Lets look at each in detail:

## Accommodations Division

## Front Office

The front office is the central point, which makes room reservations, registers guests into the hotel, provides information to them during their stay and maintains their master bills. It is the most frequented and visible department than any other in the hotel and therefore, sets the lead in the guest experience. Their prime responsibility is to sell rooms, register guests, process room reservations, coordinate guest services, provide information and ensure room revenues are met as per budget. The front office is supported by the Lobby services which include the concierge, bell desk, guest relations and transportation. The Front Office structure is discussed in detail in the next chapter but for immediate reference given below are thumbnail descriptions of the role of each person in the front office operation.

Front Office Manager: Responsible for managing the front office, lobby and transport activities. S/he translates company policies and procedures into the department.

Front Office Supervisor: Responsible for a shift as the front office operates for twenty-four hours.

Information Assistant: Is the one who provides information to in-house guests and visitors; handles guest and hotel mail; controls the guest room keys; and provides the messaging services.

Registration Assistant: Is the person who registers guests into the hotel and allots rooms to them.

Reservation Assistants: Makes room reservations and controls the supply of rooms for sale.

Front Office Cashier: Maintains the guest folios (bills) and receives payment when a guest checks out.

## Business Centre

The business centre is a viable revenue generating operation nowadays in most hotels and in particular,  a  business  hotel.  It  is  considered  a  minor  operating  department  under  the accommodations division. They lease space to visiting business persons on a daily basis. The business centre consists of a reception area, secretarial desks, office automation area that serves independent offices, meeting rooms, and board rooms. Business men can use this facility as an office away from office. The offices are equipped with broadband computer connections and telecommunication services. The typical staff would include:

Business Centre Executive: She is responsible for business development and coordinating all centre requirements.

Receptionist: She books offices, handles appointments and handles the billing.

Secretary/s: They provide the typing services to visiting business men.

## Housekeeping

This department is responsible for the cleanliness, maintenance and the aesthetic standard of the hotel. Housekeeping provides laundered staff uniforms, room and restaurant linen and fresh and dried flower

arrangements. The different sections of housekeeping are: the housekeeping management that plans, organises and controls all aspects of the housekeeping function; the guest room brigade which is responsible for the upkeep of guest rooms; housekeeping control desk which passes information to housekeeping staff working at various parts of the hotel essentially the guest floors and the maintenance; a linen and uniform room that coordinates with the laundry for the supply of clean linen and uniforms; the laundry that supplies the hotel with washed laundry, staff with uniforms  and  guests  with  their  laundry  requirements;  the horticultural  team who  maintain landscapes, flower beds, nursery and green house; the flower room where flowers are procured and prepared for decoration in rooms, lobbies or buffet tables; the lost and found section to deposit misplaced guest belongings; and the public area brigade who are responsible for the cleaning  of  the  front  office,  lobby,  restaurants  and  other  areas.  (See  each  lesson  for  greater details).

## Other Minor Revenue Departments under Accommodations

## Health Club &amp; Recreation Centre

A health club is responsible for all health and recreational activities. These include:

- 1. Swimming pool
- 2. Childrens pool
- 3. Gymnasium for men and women
- 4. Massage rooms
- 5. Turkish baths
- 6. Saunas
- 7. Jacuzzis
- 8. Spas
- 9. Yoga rooms
- 10. Aerobic rooms
- 11. Squash courts
- 12. Tennis Courts
- 13. Badminton Courts
- 14. Para-sailing
- 15. Jet Skis
- 16. Motor boats
- 17. Paddle boats
- 18. Surfing

Sometimes the operations are so large that health and recreation are segregated. The health club would be under a health club manager while recreation would be supervised by a recreation supervisor. Typical jobs would include:

## Health Club

Health Club Manager: Responsible for the organisation and control of all health club activities.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Masseurs and Masseuses: For massage of men and women. There are variations to massages such as Thai massages, Kerala Massages, etc.

Yoga Instructors: Who are qualified to give yogic instructions.

Life Guards: For the swimming pool

Gym Instructor: He supervises and maintains the gym and gives specialist counsel on muscle building and weight loss.

Aerobic Instructor: One who provides aerobic instruction for health and fitness guests.

Receptionist cum Cashier: Who registers guests and raises bills for use of facilities. She would perhaps also maintain membership cards should the facility be open to the local populace.

## Recreation

Recreation Supervisor: One who drives all recreational activities including the purchase of sports  equipment,  safe  storage  of  the  same,  maintenance  and  repair  of  courts  and  revenue generation campaigns.

Coaches: There may be separate coaches for tennis, squash, badminton etc. There are separate coaches for water sports like para-sailing jet skis and surfing.

Life Guards: These are required where there are water sports. Water sports are found at beaches, lakes, rivers and waterfalls.

Receptionist cum Cashier: To generate billing records and ensure due payment. Control all memberships.

## Beauty Salon

A beauty salon has become increasingly essential in most superior hotels. This is because of the emergence of women travellers as a significant market segment. Women have pervaded all professions especially business. Often hotels lease space to beauticians who run the business. Many hotels want to ensure  standards  and  have  their  captive  beauty  facility.  Beauty  salon personnel include:

Beautician: She is qualified in the subject and also supervises operations.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Hair stylists: Specialists on hair cuts, perms, trims, styles etc. Manicurists: Experts on maintaining good hand and feet nails. Waxing specialists: These are experts in unwanted hair removal. Cashier: Who raises bills and receives payments.

## Barber Shop

An extension to the beauty salon for women is the barber shop for men. Men nowadays have become very fashion conscious influenced by superstars and the television. The barber is no longer a military

crop variety but a stylist as accomplished as the beautician. A large hotel can earn well from such a facility. The people that are found in the barber shop are:

Hairstylists: who crop and style the hair according to latest fashions.

Manicurists: who attend to fingernails and toe nails.

## Flower Shop

A hotel with plenty of landscaped gardens, nurseries and greenhouses would have a qualified florist on their payroll to create flower arrangements for various internal purposes, including displays in the lobbies and foyers, banquet buffets, meeting room, executive offices, etc. Having this expertise prompts them to have an in-house flower shop to retail  flowers  and arrangements  to  resident  guests  and  local  populace.  Resident  guests require well-assembled bouquets for celebrity reasons or wreaths for the passing away of friends and clients. The flower shop is manned by a florist and an assistant duly supported by gardeners who grow the flowers.

## Food and Beverage Division

## Restaurants

A restaurant is a commercial establishment committed to the sale of food and beverage. A restaurant may be  a licensed part of a hotel operation, whereby the sales of the restaurant contributes to the sales performance of the hotel, or a franchised operation within the restaurant premises whereby the hotel gets the lease rent for the space and no share in the profits of the restaurant operations. Basically, restaurants provide tables and chairs for customers to eat from an attached kitchen. They are equipped with crockery, cutlery, linen and décor which may vary in quality and concept which are in keeping with the objectives of that establishment. In addition to the basic purpose, restaurants may provide the following facilities:

- l Bar
- l Entertainment
- l Children party facilities
- l Home delivery services
- l Take-away services
- l Outdoor catering

Restaurants come in various types. A housekeeping professional must understand their difference to give information to guests who make enquiries from housekeeping staff on the floor. It also helps housekeeping public area staff to understand the differences in restaurants when cleaning them as also the differences in linen and uniforms that come to them for laundering and issue. The types of restaurants are:

## Coffee Shop

A concept borrowed from the United States, distinguished by its quick service. Food is pre-plated from the kitchen. The chefs prepare complete and balanced meals and arrange them in a plate.

<!-- image -->

Coffee shop menus are quite light and simple. The portion sizes are fixed but adequate for the average guest. The atmosphere in a Coffee Shop is informal which means that guests can come in casual wear. The restaurant will have lively piped music. The tables will have table mats and paper napkins. Coffee Shops have replaced the erstwhile dining rooms of old hotels and serve many purposes. For one, most coffee shops in hotels are run 24 hours a day and are the only places which serve food at any time of the day when other restaurants in the  hotel  are  closed.  Coffee  Shops  act  as  multi-purpose  dining

<!-- image -->

opportunities. The linen, food and music can change with lunch and dinner in keeping with the mood of the day. Coffee Shops of hotels are usually found off the lobby in most cases, or beside the swimming pool.

## Specialty Restaurant

<!-- image -->

In such restaurants, the entire atmosphere and décor is geared to a particular theme normally related  to  a  regional  cuisine.  Chinese,  Indian,  Polynesian, Japanese, French restaurants are all geared to the specialty food they offer. An Indian restaurant, for example, would therefore have Indian motifs on the walls, Indian artifacts, and Indian costumes of the serving staff, piped Indian music, crockery, cutlery and glassware that give a total Indian experience. While the above mentioned cuisines have been popular and common, the world today has  introduced  new  options  of  specialty  restaurants  including  Russian, Vietnamese, Burmese, Thai, etc. Another variant to specialty restaurants are those that concentrate on a particular food item like the Fish Bazaar which

specialises in seafood and their preparation of all types; or the Beef Bistro which may limit itself to different cuts and preparations of beef. Specialty restaurants can range from very up-market and exclusive places to very casual ones like the neighbourhood Chinese or Thai restaurant.

## Grill Room or Rotisserie

This is a restaurant that specialises in grills of different meats, fish and poultry. The distinguishing feature of this type of restaurant is a glass partition that separates the kitchen from the seating area so that guests can see the grill preparation of their choice. Grill rooms are casual and may have log tables and benches and the décor would be distinctly American. The crockery may be coarse with hardy cutlery and paper or checked cloth napkins. Some of them may be as casual as to have pool tables and indoor sports. Grill rooms can be sophisticated too with finer crockery and linen but they would retain the casual ambience.

## Dining Rooms

Dining Rooms are found in smaller hotels, motels, resorts, inns, clubs or heritage hotels. Smaller hotels may find it uneconomical to have more than one eating place. The dining room is usually meant for the residents of the hotel or members of a club who may bring  their  guests  along.  Dining  rooms  can  change  their atmosphere from the casual in the morning breakfast to formal

<!-- image -->

for lunch and dinner. Rarely would they have an a la carte menu (a menu with individually priced items) in a dining room. They specialise in a good buffet spread. At the most, dining rooms will offer a choice of two table d hote menus (a menu where a meal is priced).

## Discotheque

It is a restaurant which is principally meant for dancing to recorded music. The music is driven by a qualified and experienced disc jockey (DJ) who creates or responds to the moods of the guests. Special  lighting  and  a  dance  floor  are  essential  to  the  discotheque.  The  main  feature  of  the discotheque is a bar which also offers light meals and finger picking snacks. Discotheques in hotels permit only formal casual clothing, while independent ones allow casuals. Security is the main concern for a discotheque where both girls and boys mix and drink. Just as the bartender and the disc jockey are essential employees of a discotheque, so is the bouncer who guards the entry of the discotheque and ensures proper behaviour. Discotheques do have an entry charge to ensure that the right crowds enter. Others may permit only couples to ensure the right balance of men and women. Some discotheques are strictly on membership basis.

## Night Clubs

It is principally open at night for dinner, dance and live entertainment. The décor is lavish while service is elaborate with fine linen and silver crockery. Night Clubs permit formal wear only and some go to the extent of insisting black tie only. An essential feature is live performances or cabarets which may range from famous singers and dancers, vaudeville shows, Can Can dances made famous by such leading French Night Clubs as the Lido or the Moulin Rouge, to strip tease performances. A live band with a dance floor is a must. A variant to entertainment is the supper theatre where guests experience a play before or after dinner.  A night club will have bar with bartenders who are entertainers themselves.

Figure 1.7 gives the typical structure of a restaurant.

## Room Service

Room Service is a food service operation. It provides food and beverage to guest rooms. The room service is located in the kitchen and has an order-takers desk. Guests may order their food and beverage orders directly from their rooms to the room service order-taker who will pass on the  order  to  the  service  team.  The  service  team  coordinates  with  the  kitchen  or  bar  for  the preparation of the item.

Room Service Manager: Responsible for translating management policies, procedures and standards to the department. S/he is accountable for all room service operations.

Room Service Supervisor: Responsible for a shift in a twenty-four hour room service operation of a busy hotel. He would direct the waiters and order-takers in the shift to provide efficient service.

Order-takers: Responsible for receiving guest food &amp; beverage orders on the phone and raising the required bill. S/he will also coordinate breakfast door knobs which are pre-ordered breakfast requests made the previous night.

Fig. 1.8 Organisation Chart of Room Service

<!-- image -->

Room Service Waiters: They have the privilege to serve guests in the privacy of their rooms. They are also responsible for clearance of trays and trolleys from rooms once the guest is finished with the meal.

Room Service Cashier: S/he is responsible for accounting for all food and beverage service transactions so as to recover the charges from the guests either in cash or billing the master guest folio at the front office.

Future Perspectives: Only exclusive hotels will provide room service. Most medium and small hotels will provide vending machines providing hot and cold snacks, ice cubes and liquor. Tea and Coffee kettles will be available in the rooms as self-help features.

## Kitchen

A kitchen is the place where food is prepared. While large kitchens have independent sections to deal with various aspects of food preparation due to the sheer volume of activity, smaller kitchens

## LESSON  1 Overview

would club sections or have multi-skilled cooks to carry out several roles. Restaurant personnel coordinate closely with kitchens for the supply of guest food orders.

Butchery: In  this  section,  raw  meats  are  cut  from  wholesale  cuts  and carcasses into smaller portions of given weight, ready for cooking. This section is also responsible for curing meats like bacon, sausages and hams by  having  curing  chambers.  In  modern  hotels,  the  butchery  function  is outsourced to external butchers who supply pre-cut portions as per the specifications of the hotel.

Garde Manger : It is the section where cold dishes such as hors doeuvres, cold meat cuts, salads, galantines and pates are made. This section would be kept cool to deal with perishable items as also ice carving for buffets.

<!-- image -->

This section supplies items for public sale to the in-house delicatessen of the hotel.

Pantry: It is the source for sandwiches, fruit platters, juices and shakes. Some pantries undertake light hot snacks like burgers, club sandwiches, grilled sandwiches, etc.

Bakery and Confectionary: This  section  prepares  various  breads,  bread  rolls,  croissants, brioches, cakes, pastries, muffins, cookies, flans, tarts, and ice creams. While the temperature in a bakery is hot with industrial ovens, the confectionary is kept cool, as most pastry items have to be kept fresh. Modern hotels have found it convenient and economical to outsource this activity as well. A hotel with a captive bakery and confectionary shop may receive from this section supplies for public sale.

Hot Range: It  is  the  main  cooking  range where hot foods are prepared. They have a wide variety of equipment from ranges, which are coal, gas and electric fire and griddles, deep fat fryers  and  steamers.  An  essential  part  of  the  hot  range  is  a  counter  with  hot  cases  to  keep prepared food warm. It becomes the nodal point for controlling all guest food orders. The hot range is where sauces are prepared for various continental dishes.

Grill: Provides grilled items like kebabs, sizzlers, tandooris and other grilled meats and vegetables.

Vegetable preparation: Processes raw vegetables into smaller cuts for cooking. There are modern automatic machines for peeling, slicing and cutting.

Still Room: Tea and Coffee are brewed here. A still is a chamber in which water continuously boils. For tea or coffee service, a waiter may insert the teapot with tea leaves or tea bags, according to the portions required, and fill the teapot with boiling water from the still. In operations where there are quick turnovers of tea or coffee, the stills can actually keeping brewing tea or coffee at low temperatures. In coffee stills, ground coffee is brewed and supplied instantly.

Soups Section: Huge stock kettles prepare quantity stock used as the base for various soups.

Satellite Kitchens: These kitchens are located away from the main kitchen to supply food to scattered restaurants in a hotel. Often these kitchens are attached to specialty restaurants with their specialised cuisine preparation methods, equipment and service. Figure 1.9 gives a typical organisation chart of a kitchen operation.

Chef-de-Cuisine is the head of the kitchen responsible for planning, organising and controlling the kitchen operations. It is a management position.

Fig. 1.9 Organisation Chart of a Kitchen

<!-- image -->

Sous Chef is  the deputy chef who shares some of the Chef-de-cuisines responsibilities. He directs the kitchen operation in his absence.

Chef-de-parties are supervisors responsible for a section of the kitchen. S/he translates the managements policies and procedures into the section. A chef-de-partie is  skilled  enough to head a small kitchen operation.

Specialist Chef-de-parties are those who have developed skills in a specific field of a kitchen. The Chef Tournant is a reliever chef who can replace any of the regular chef-de-parties in their absence. Therefore, this specialist has to have a wide variety of cooking skills. The Chef Saucier is a specialist in sauces. He becomes a key person in continental cuisine, which relies heavily on sauces. The Chef Pâtissier is specialised in confectionary items especially cakes and pastries. The Chef Rotisseur is skilled in roasts and grills and is assisted by the Grillardin , the grill cook and the Savourier , the savoury cook.. The Aboyeur is the announcer of dishes for preparation to various sections, once orders come in from the restaurant. He is also known as a barker who coordinates the restaurant orders with the kitchen. Chef Garde Manger is responsible for the cold  kitchen  preparations. Chef Bouchier is  the  expert  in  butchery  and  meat  cuts.  Another variation  to  the  butcher  is  the Chef Charcutier who is  the  expert  on  pork  based  items  like sausages, ham, etc. Chef Poissonier specialises in fish preparations. Chef Potager is responsible for the Soups section. He becomes another key person in continental cuisine. Chef Communar is responsible for staff cafeteria meals.  Other specialists not found on the chart but are in large food production operations are the Chef Entremetier who prepares vegetables while the Chef Volailler is the poultryman specialised in chicken items and game birds. The Breakfast Cook, Chef de Banquets and Chef de Nuit (the night cook) are all specialists in their own way.

Commis are general cooks who make the food items. They may be given titles of Commis I, Commis II and Commis III based on their experience and skill level.

Future Perspectives: Hotels of the future will prefer to lease out restaurant and kitchen space to branded restaurants than be involved in running them. The leasers will be responsible for running their own kitchens and food service. Hotels may maintain an all-purpose coffee shop, room service and banqueting. The volume of kitchen activity would be certainly curtailed by outsourcing the butchery, vegetable preparation, bakery, confectionary and cold kitchens. Many hotel kitchen and service professionals will find meaningful careers in franchise and outsourced operations in addition to hotels.

## Bars

The bar dispenses wines, liquor, spirits, juices, aerated waters, cigars and cigarettes. Restaurant food  service  professionals  will  coordinate  with  the  bar  for  guest  beverage  orders.  The  bar organisation chart is given below:

Fig. 1.10 Organisation Chart of a Bar

<!-- image -->

Bar Manager: Translates hotel policies, procedures and standards into the bar operation. He directs the bar operations ensuring efficient guest service.

Bartender: Mans the bar counter and supplies drinks directly to guests seated at the counter and to the waitresses serving tables elsewhere. He is known for his customer relations, showmanship and unique cocktails.

Bar Waitresses: Also known as barmaids or cocktail waitresses, they serve beverage orders at tables. Waitresses bring in a lot of showmanship and charm to bar operations.

Future Perspectives: Bars will continue to be a captive revenue generating activity of future hotels.

## Kitchen Stewarding

This department is primarily concerned with the storage, maintenance, cleanliness and issue of cutlery, crockery, hollow-ware, chinaware and glassware to the restaurants and kitchens. It is

responsible for the cleanliness of kitchens and the washing of pots and pans. It procures, installs and services gas connections and coal supply for cooking. The department would ideally have a large store for kitchen and service equipment, dishwashers and pot washing section. Many hotels may give the responsibility of the staff cafeteria to the kitchen stewarding. In such cases, the stewarding would have their own brigade of cooks to prepare staff meals. Kitchen Stewarding is also responsible for pest control activity of a kitchen. The kitchen stewarding will remain an integral part of food service operations.

<!-- image -->

Fig. 1.11 Organisation Chart of Kitchen Stewarding

<!-- image -->

Executive Kitchen Steward: Is responsible for planning, organising, directing and controlling the stewarding activity. He would control the kitchen stewarding stores and ensure that the kitchens and restaurants get their needs smoothly.

Kitchen Steward: This is a supervisory level responsible for a shift. Stewarding activity is a twenty-four hour activity in a busy hotel.

Utility Workers: These are the cleaning brigades, who clean kitchens and equipment and do other heavy work.

Dishwashers: They operate the dishwashing machine that cleans all the service ware.

Pot Washers (plongeurs): They clean large pots and cooking utensils of the kitchen, using jet water sprays.

Kitchen Porter is the title given by small independent hotels to utility workers who do multi-tasks.

Future perspectives: Kitchen  stewarding  is  an  important  function  to maintain the ever strict municipal and health authorities about sanitation and hygiene standards in food preparation areas. At the most, this activity

<!-- image -->

can be given on a contract to cleaning companies though equipment like the dish-washing machine will be owned by the property.

## Other minor revenue departments of F&amp;B

<!-- image -->

## Delicatessen

A delicatessen  is  a  shop  that  sells  processed  meats.  It  exists  if  the establishment has its captive butchery with craftsmen to make these fine meats. A delicatessen would have refrigerated counters serving items like salami, assorted sausages, ham, bacon, meat loafs, etc. The shop will  be  manned  by  a counter salesperson cum cashier who  has good knowledge of the range of meats served.

## Pastry Shop

A pastry shop is a good window to sell in-house pastries and cakes. A hotel that has a captive

confectionary will take advantage to sell its items to those who reside locally in addition to hotel guests. The pastry shop will sell items like cakes, pastries, ice-creams, tarts and puddings. The shop will be manned by a counter salesperson cum cashier who  has  good  knowledge  of  the  range  of

sweetmeats served.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Bake Shop

An extension to the pastry shop is the bake shop that sells all sorts of breads including loafs, buns, breadsticks, pretzels, vol-au-vonts, patties and mini-pizzas, etc. Naturally the hotel will boast of an accomplished in-house bakery to create such a facility. The bake shop will be manned by a counter salesperson cum cashier who is knowledgeable of bakery items.

## Staff Functions

## Finance and Accounts

The Finance and Accounts department are responsible for two major activities: 1) The finance section is responsible for raising funds and multiplying profits through innovative investments and funding so as to ensure that the hotel meets its capital and operational funds. It is because of this function that the traditional accountant is re-titled the Financial Controller. He is ably assisted by the Financial Analysts who are educated and trained in funds management. 2) The accounts section monitors the revenues and expenditures of the hotel. They ensure that cash flows are available for daily operations by controlling the bank accounts and making cash available through the General Cashier. The accounts section will prepare the statutory balance sheets and profit and loss statements for the investors of the hotel.

The accounts section has important professionals like the Income Accountant who monitors all  the  cash and credit receivables from guests for services rendered. He is assisted by a City Ledger Clerk who monitors all credit receivables. The Accounts Payable Clerk pays all creditors including contractors and suppliers. The Salaries and Wages Clerk computes salaries and staff deductions on a monthly basis to ensure that employees get their salaries on time. The Food &amp; Beverage Controller takes case of the costs of all food and beverages consumed in restaurants, bars, rooms, service, banquets, and outside catering. He is responsible for the inventory maintained in all the stores and gives independent reports of goods received and issued. The Financial Controller supervises the purchase and receiving which are the parts of the control chain. Figure 1.12 gives the organisation chart of the department.

Future Perspectives: Routine accounting like payroll, collections, revenue accounts is likely to be given to Back Processing Offices (BPOs) units leaving the department to concentrate on financial management. The Finance function will try to leverage earned capital with investments that will raise further capital for future operations and growth. Accounting software are available that integrate accounting information from various revenue generating centres into financial statements for decision making. Guests will be able to keep a tab on their bills through the room television screens.

## Engineering

This department is responsible for the supply of air-conditioning (or heating), lighting, mechanical, electrical, carpentry, electronic and civil works of the hotel. The restaurant depends on them for climate control, mechanical equipment and maintenance of furniture. We must not forget that the  entire  fire  fighting  system  of  the  hotel  is  managed  and  maintained  by  the  engineering department. Fire arrangements would include water reservoirs, fire alarm systems and fire fighting systems. They would be conducting fire drills periodically. Figure 1.13 shows how engineering is organised.

Fig. 1.13 Organisation Chart of Engineering

<!-- image -->

Chief Engineer: A man qualified and experienced to lead a team of engineers.

Mechanical Engineer: Responsible for all mechanical works like elevators, escalators, mechanical equipment, etc. He has a workshop where mechanics repair and maintain things.

Civil  Engineer: Responsible  for  all  building  and  allied  services.  In addition  to  carpentry,  masonry  and  plumbing  he  would  also  be responsible for all water treatment and sewage systems.

Electrical Engineer: Responsible for all electrical systems like power and lighting fed by sub-stations to the building. He has the responsibility for  the  air-conditioning  and  refrigeration.  The  task  gets  larger  when hotels become mega-complexes.

Electronics  Engineer: Responsible  for  all  electronic  equipment including networked personal computers, electronic engineering control panels, security systems, fire alarm systems, audio-visual systems etc.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Future Perspectives: Engineering will have bigger challenges in the future, as buildings will get more sophisticated and technical. Electronics will play a bigger part as air-conditioning &amp; heating systems, water systems, fire alarm systems, elevators &amp; escalators and engineering information systems will all be controlled from a single control panel. We would have multi-skilled staff to manage day-to-day problems while the suppliers of sophisticated engineering systems will maintain the systems on maintenance contracts.

## Human Resources

The Human Resources department is key to any hotel operation as they are concerned with the very important resourcepeople. The department is responsible for the hiring; maintenance and exit of staff (see organisation chart Fig. 1.14). They are concerned with such vital activities such as:

- l Recruitment to fill permanent and temporary vacancies. This becomes critical especially when additional staff is required during peak periods in a day, week or season. The HR department is good at contacting sources of manpower supply. Their challenge is to feed the hotel operations with qualified people to meet the objectives of the establishment.
- l Orientation and Socialisation is provided to newcomers to help them settle into the organisation and job at the shortest possible time.
- l Training makes a very important contribution to any hotel operation to keep its employees meet high international standards and keep up to date with new developments in knowledge and skills. The HR department will have trained trainers to develop skills and careers according to the standards set by the organisation.

Fig. 1.14 Organisation Chart of the Human Resources Department

<!-- image -->

86

- l Compensation and Benefits is an important function to ensure that salaries and wages are kept competitive and also coordinates the performance appraisal process to ensure that performers are rewarded.
- l Exit formalities are important to ensure that all the dues to an exiting employee are honored as per labor laws.

## Sales and Marketing

The marketing department creates the groundwork to get customers to want to select the property for their stay and convert that decision into a sale by actually booking a room and staying in it. The marketing activity involves advertisement in various media such as television, newspapers, trade magazines etc. The department also organises promotions to attract guests in different seasons and festivities. Their team of sales personnel go out into the market and sell the property to corporate houses, travel agents, tour operators and airlines for volume business.

An important aspect of this department is their coordination with front office and housekeeping. While front office backs the sales efforts by providing the rooms, the housekeeping must ensure a  positive  experience  during  the  guests  stay.  All  sales  efforts  come  to  nought  if  these  two departments do not fulfil their responsibilities towards the sales department.

Fig. 1.15 Organisation Chart of Sales and Marketing Department

<!-- image -->

Sales and Marketing Manager is  responsible  to  translate  hotel  policies  and  budgets  into departmental action plans. S/he is the main person to feed the management with information from the external environment. This is achieved through market research and market intelligence of changing government policies and laws, customer preferences and behaviour, competition and general changing business trends. S/he converts this into marketing plans that meet the revenue targets of the hotel. S/he then distributes these responsibilities to the sales and marketing team.

Marketing Manager takes the load of marketing activity and distributes his or her responsibilities among the marketing assistants. The marketing manager will be responsible for coordinating

87

with advertising agencies to prepare and schedule advertisement campaigns; prepare brochures and  sales  kits;  merchandising  material  for  all  revenue  departments  of  the  hotel;  and  special promotional campaigns. He or she will commission market research agencies to conduct guest surveys and competition analysis.

Sales Manager conducts personal sales calls with his team of sales executives. The responsibilities of  the  sales  executives  may  be  distributed  in  two  ways:  1)  by  geographical  regions  or  2)  by specialised clients such as travel agencies, airlines, corporate houses, diplomatic missions and government.

## 1.4 TYPES OF ROOMS

## Introduction

A housekeeping professional must be familiar and have knowledge of the rooms of the hotel available for sale. Each hotel has a variety of rooms to meet the needs of guests. A single guest would like to stay in a single room to be cost effective, while a couple will find a double room more convenient. A family may choose a suite to have more leg room for children to move around. A business executive may want a special suite to entertain privately or show off his financial status to his or her clients. Similarly, budget groups may be willing to share twin

<!-- image -->

rooms while up-market groups may prefer single rooms. Guest needs are endless and their motives for booking a type of room may be varied.

## Significance of Rooms

The sale of rooms constitutes approximately 50% or more to the total hotel revenue. A sale of a room means the leasing of the room for occupation for 24 hours at a predetermined cost. A room not sold on a particular day losses its opportunity to earn revenue for the day. Hence rooms are referred to as perishable commodities. The loss of sale can also result from the inefficiency of the housekeeping department to have a room not ready when required. What does a room means to a guest?

- 1. It means comfort: hotel investors spend efforts in ensuring the quality of beds, mattresses, weather control, music channel, hot and cold water, attached bathrooms, etc. The comforts must be regularly maintained and functioning. It is the responsibility of housekeeping to ensure this.
- 2. It means security: the primary security devise that hotels provide is to restrict the entrance to a room only through one door. In addition, they provide double locking from inside; peep-holes in doors; precautions that all electrical wires are concealed; equipment in the rooms are not faulty; the room is provided with a sprinkler or fire detection system; and the room is provided with fire exit route plans behind the room door. Housekeeping personnel on floors are alert to unknown guests on a floor and seek the help of security in case of suspicion.
- 3. It means privacy: the hotel ensures that room windows are provided with curtains. Superior hotels will have daylight curtains and heavy curtains during the night. Windows would normally have scenic views, away from prying eyes. However, downtown hotels may be sandwiched between two buildings requiring privacy for the guest. The telephone department has been instructed to protect the privacy of room numbers and guests staying in them. They ask the guest if they wish to be connected to a caller before the actual connection. The front office staff also protects room numbers and guests staying in them. Authorised staff that wish to enter a room have to announce themselves before they are admitted in. Housekeeping staff is trained to knock the door announcing themselves twice before entering the room.
- 4. It means convenience: A guest is provided with entertainment, food and beverage services, telephone services, etc. in the room. The guest is, therefore, free to spend all the time

towards  fulfilling  the  purpose  of  his/her  business.  The  housekeeping  department  must ensure that the guest has the necessary literature to access such conveniences.

- 5. It means cleanliness and hygiene: The housekeeping department is responsible for the most personal area of a guest during his/her staythe room. The room must be clean and the bathroom made hygienic for the guests stay. This is a major factor for the guest to return.
- 6. A Home Away from Home: The most obvious reason why hotel rooms are important is because they provide a residence and address when a guest is travelling. They expect all the comfort and security of a home and are willing to pay for it.

## Types of Rooms

A typical hotel will have the following types of rooms:

Adjacent Room: Two rooms beside each other across the corridor

Adjoining Room:

Two rooms that are either beside each other and/or have an interconnecting door

Cabana: A room with a sofa cum bed ideally situated beside swimming pools or beaches Connecting Room: Two rooms with an interconnecting door, ideal for a family

Double Room: A room with one king size double bed.

Executive Room: A room with additional features like internet connections, computer points,

mini bars, etc; specially designed for the business executive.

Single Room: A room with a single bed.

Studio: A room with a sofa cum bed.

Triplet: A double room with one extra rollaway cot.

Twin Room: A room with two single beds.

Quad: A room for four people fitted with twin beds and two roll-away beds

Queen: A room with a queen-sized bed for single or double occupancy

Junior Suite: A room with a seating parlour and a bed

Double Suite:

Two rooms, one serving as a living cum dining area and the other with a double bed

Duplex Suite: Two suites on two floors with an interconnecting staircase

Executive Suite:

Suite specially fitted for business executives

Single Suite:

Two rooms, one serving as a living cum dining area and another with a single bed

Tourist Huts:

An independent suite detached from the main hotel. They will be found in resorts for greater privacy and exclusivity. Some suites have kitchenettes.

Chalets: Independent homes for lease found in Switzerland

Suites may be given names as the Presidential Suite, Diplomatic Suite, Governors Suite etc. for the reservation to identify them. Suites are similar to all other suites distinguished by more lavish décor and appointments. Some suites are named after the theme of the hotel Like the Maurya Sheraton, New Delhi, India that has named suites after emperors of the Mauryan dynasty, like the Chandragupta Suite or the Ashoka Suite.

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

## 1.5 WHAT IS MANAGEMENT?

## Introduction

This chapter has been introduced in this book because the future housekeeping professional will be  required  to  execute  some  basic  management  functions  as  mentioned  in   The New Housekeeping Professional  in the Introduction. Traditional hierarchies will fall and workforces will shrink, empowering the guest contact personnel with enriched jobs. S/he will be required perhaps to perform tasks that were done by the supervisor before. It is important, therefore, that housekeeping professionals know the fundamentals of management. This chapter is also useful to  existing  supervisors  and  managers  of  housekeeping  operations  as  a  review  against  their understanding of management.

## What is Management?

Management is the effective utilization of given resources to achieve the enterprises objectives. The two keys terms are enterprises objectives and resources. All enterprises, whether commercial or not, have objectives. The basic objective of all hotels is to provide comfortable lodging services of international standards.

## Objectives

Objectives are goals (on a long term basis) or targets (on a short-term basis) to aspire for and achieve within given time frames. There are some generic objectives that all enterprises would generally like to strive for:

Profitability: This is different from profit. Profit is the getting of money at all  costs  even  if  it  has  to  harm  the  reputation  of  the  establishment  or shortchanging the customer. Profitability believes that the customer deserves his or her basic due, having paid for the lodging and services. Profitability is a good objective to have for any investor in hotel business otherwise he should not be in business at all. It encourages customers to come back.

Growth: The next valuable objective of a commercial enterprise is growth. Hotels  would  like  to  see  growth  in  the  number  of  services,  growth  in customers, growth in revenue, growth in rooms and the growth of employees. Growth is essential to be healthy and prosperous. Stagnation will lead to the demise of the property.

<!-- image -->

Survival: This is an important objective. Any enterprise is subject to competition, which is trying to woo the customers and employees away from it. Today, the customer has so many choices and tastes to try out something new. An employee today has no loyalties to an organisation as before. They will offer their services to the highest bidder. The survival against competition is an important objective. Enterprises have to survive government laws and conditions of business. For example, if a state is to bring in new taxes the revenue targets would be severely hit. The decision then would be whether to increase room rates or bear the impact of taxes giving the guest the benefit, to survive the new law.

Image: The reputation of the establishment is very important for it to survive. Image in the service industry is very fragile and can be broken with one bad incident. Hotels are influenced by

the word of mouth and bad publicity diminishes the confidence of guests in the property. Hotels are a popular topic of conversation in social gatherings because they are the social spots of a city and very personal to guests. It is here that guests sleep and eat when away from home. They trust the establishment to give them safe and healthy environments and products and will talk about it to others.

Innovation: This has become the buzzword of all modern enterprises. Customers today are always looking for something new. Very few products and services remain the same. The mobile telephone industry and the camera industry, for instance, are innovating every six months. The hotel industry is not far behind. The turnaround time for service is reducing with technology and guests get instant service. People get experience fatigue too and want something new to challenge their experiences. Hotels offer specialty restaurants offering unique cuisines.

<!-- image -->

Hotels  must  try  to  bring  innovation  through  food  and  beverage  offering,  entertainment, promotions and décor. Traditional hotels have given way to floating hotels, rotels, matels, etc. (see Lesson 1.1 Types of Hotels and their Categorisation for more details), each coming forward with innovations to meet guest requirements as well as give them new experiences. In this industry, the saying goes, Innovate or die!

Innovation also has made giant strides in the information technology industry. New software is able to process any possible information speedily and accurately. Some innovations in software are accounting packages, guest history, reservations, F&amp;B controls etc.

Another expression of innovation is continuous improvement. Employees are now required to give suggestion constantly to improve products and services.

Customer Service: The customer is the king. Unless an establishment places the customer as its central focus of business, it is going to die in the present global competition. Hotels must meet the changing needs and wants of the customer. Organisations have gone to great lengths to provide customer service. They have created standardised greetings on the telephone; standardised smiles like Disney World who paint a smile on the staff mirror for them to copy. Restaurants have set delivery times like five minutes for beverage orders and twenty minutes for food orders. They have found ways to address guests by name as seen in hotel room service order taking software.

Teamwork: Organisations have given emphasis to teamwork. Not only have they empowered frontline staff but have held teams accountable for performance. They recognize that a hitch in the service chain can affect the ultimate guest satisfaction.

While these are some generic objectives of organisations, each have their own set of objectives based on their current circumstances.

## Resources

The next key word in the definition of management is resource. Every manager has several resources, some of which are traditional and some new because of the changing times. Lets take a look at what Peter Drucker, the management guru, called the Ms.

Men : It is an archaic term for human resources. Women have come in a big way into the regular workforce, especially in the hospitality industry, and have justified this resource to be titled as the

human resource. The modern world has brought into the working community other resources like those with different sexual orientation or handicapped people. The human resource is the key to hotel operations and provides the cutting edge to it. The difference between physical products and facilities, have narrowed down. One hotel is just as good as the other in décor, space, entertainment, etc.  The distinguishing feature is the service experience provided by the employees of the hotel. As a critical resource, hotel managers are challenged to get the right employees with the right skills and competencies. Some countries have an acute shortage of skilled  hotel  work  forces  and  have  to  resort  to  non-traditional  sources  of  housewives;  senior citizens; college students; etc. to man their services. Training to bring them upto international standards becomes a huge task. Then there is the challenge of fair wages.  While most countries stipulate minimum wages, these may not be enough to attract the best talent.

Materials: These are the capital and operational supplies that are essential to running a hotel. Capital supplies in the hotel industry include linen, cutlery, crockery, glassware, etc. Operational supplies  would  include  stationery,  commodities,  perishable  goods,  guest  amenities,  cleaning supplies, etc. The software in computerised operations would come under this category. These items incur a cost and managers have to work under strict budgets.

Machines: These are the equipment required to fulfil the objectives of business. The engineering equipment, fire equipment, vacuum cleaners, carpet shampoo machines, maid carts, trolleys, etc. come under this category. These are expensive and come under capital items that require big budgets.

Money: Refers  to  the  capital  budgets  and  operational  cash  flows  required  to  fulfil  the  basic purpose of business i.e. to make money. The promoter of the establishment puts in the equity to start the operation in order that it may earn him a return on investment. Money also covers the operating funds to run the business on a day-to-day basis. It ensures funds flow for the purchase of supplies to do business.

While the above have been the traditional M-factors of the industrial age, new concerns have risen with the service age. These new concerns, also represented in M-factors are:

Metres: Refers to physical space to carry out the operation. We all know that land and building space are prohibitively expensive these days. It becomes a critical component of a balance sheet. Decisions whether to purchase or lease is critical. Space in the downtown is more expensive than in suburbs. Important decisions have to be made as to where to locate the operation and the probability of recovering the investment in space. In future, hotels are going to lease space to branded restaurants and other facilities. Leases are going to become a way of life for outlets. The

challenge for all the managers is the effective utilisation of space. Shrinking space has done away with elaborate office cabins and the introduction of work stations. Downtown hotels have managed space by building upwards into skyscrapers. Shortage of space for parking has made hoteliers build downwards into basement parking. The fast food industry has been ingenious in the use of space to provide  cooking  and  service  facilities  in  confined  spaces. Housekeeping has to innovate to manage with less space for floor pantries, linen and uniform rooms and housekeeping stores.

<!-- image -->

Minutes: This underlines the significance of the time. Time has become an important factor for both businesses and guests. Wonderful windows of opportunities of investment and ideas are opening up and if  the timing of response of the business to those opportunities is apt then that business will profit and be successful. Guests too have become time conscious and want products and services to be delivered on time. We have seen the success of fast-food operations and food courts just for this reason. They recognized that the modern consumer on the fast lane and needs immediate service. Hotels have built in-room tea service to eliminate morning tea service rush of the room service. Housekeeping is conscious of time by adhering to standard times to prepare a room.

Minds: Peter Drucker had said that the only true thing that matters is knowledge. Harnessing the minds of the existing staff and attracting good talent is a big challenge. Organisations have given impetus to learning, and  encourage  their  staff  to  give  new  ideas.  Recruitment  firms  are challenged to get the right minds. We may think that there is a surfeit of unemployed people available. However, establishments do not want just warm bodies as before, but those who have the right knowledge and skills. If innovation is the key to survival, then having a pool of creative

<!-- image -->

minds is essential. This is the information age and knowledge has a premium attached to it.

Methods: This is how things are done. Some of the key criteria in determining methods to deliver results are: timing, standardization, quality, customer service and consistency. Another aspect of methodology is to remove bureaucracy in decision-making. It is for this reason that organisations have adopted flatter structures. The systems and procedures must be so designed as to respond to business environments quickly. Adaptation to changing scenarios is a challenge and can be achieved by flexible systems. Establishments have employed computers to fulfil a lot of information and process requirements. Fast food chains have mastered standardisation of products and services.

Measurement: There is a new challenge to measure quality and performance. Guests have become used to quality due to the technological revolution and expect the same from services. Just as the consumer expects a faultless car, television or washing machine, they expect a faultless service.  How  can  service  establishments  ensure  this?  They  adopt  those  processes  which  are encouraged by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) based in Switzerland. The ISO movement ensures to the customers a basic standard of service performance. Other establishments have adopted Total Quality Management enveloping everyone in the organisation towards quality.

<!-- image -->

The earlier concepts of quality control or quality assurance is a passé. The measurement of performance, whether it is human performance, financial performance or equipment performance, ensures  achievement  of  objectives  on  a  consistent  basis. Organisations now adopt methods such as the Management by Objectives, Balance Score Card or 360 degrees evaluation (see Lesson 3.7 entitled Performance Appraisal for details) to bring about better people performance. Performance of finance against the  opportunity  costs  of  investment  pose  another  challenge. Finance must bring good returns to the investor who can close shop and use the money in other lucrative avenues such as real

estate or money markets. Equipment too has to show results in terms of low maintenance costs, longevity and consistent performance.

## Summary

Management then is the effective utilisation of resources to meet given objectives. The challenge here is that resources are never available in plenty. The workers role is to manage with shortages and use creative ways to fill the gaps. For example, a bar short of appropriate glasses offered cocktails in coconut shells. Expensive crockery can be replaced with banana leaves when serving Indian food. Shortage of seats in restaurants can extend service to patios or cars parked outside. Creativity is limitless. The mind is the only barrier.

## Management Challenges in Hotel Operations

Any Hotel operation, whether independent or part of a larger chain, is influenced by internal and external factors. The diagram below gives an overview of such:

The external factors that comprise the macro-environment have to be respected to survive in the community it serves. Let us look at each:

Political Environment: The local and federal government passes laws that affect hotel operations. There are laws that govern:

- l Labor that includes minimum wages, grievance handling, working hours, annual leaves, etc.
- l Health &amp; Hygiene that concern aspects of food poisoning such as food preparation conditions, storage conditions, hygiene of cooks and servers, etc.

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

- l Safety that refer to fire hazards, cooking hazards that affect the cooking staff, safe eating facilities for customers, proper air circulation, etc.
- l Environment that refer to issues of pollution such as garbage disposal, drainage systems, etc.
- l The recycling of materials including food, paper, bottles, cartons etc.
- l Tax that help the government provide infrastructure.

Economic Environment: This aspect certainly influences the success of business. The economic conditions of a region influence the buying power of the customers and also the cost of running the operation. Some issues that govern the economic state are:

- l Rate of inflation and rising costs of raw materials, labor, fuel, insurance, etc.
- l Distribution of economic wealth
- l Actions that stimulate growth and employment
- l Disposable income in the hands of the public
- l Regional development
- l Sales instability including the peaks and troughs of business.
- l Expansion or retraction of credit facilities.
- l Interest rates on borrowed capital.

<!-- image -->

Social Environment: This has a great impact on how the hotel operation runs to find acceptability and patronage of the target market. The social environment is influenced by:

- l Changes in demographics e.g. emerging women workforce
- l Business and ethics
- l Who makes the decisions at home
- l Convenience shopping like home delivery, take-away foods, fast foods,
- l Growth in ethnic minorities demanding varied foods.
- l Food habits.
- l Religious restrictions like no beef for Indians or no pork for Muslims.
- l Concern for healthy eating.

Technological  Environment: Technology  is  changing  the  way  people  work  and  has revolutionised  work  practices.  The  hotel  industry  has  had  its  fair  share  of  the  impact  of  this revolution that has benefited both workers and customers. Some of the technological factors are:

<!-- image -->

- l Mechanisation of work methods has greatly influenced operations. The photocopier has shortened time by removing the arduous task of having carbon copies of documents. In housekeeping, the vaccum cleaner has revolutionised the time and effort in cleaning.
- l Information technology has influenced how information is processed. Front office software has eliminated maintaining Whitney Racks and the time to keep them updated. The telephone operator and room service order-taker knows instantly of a new guest arrival as computers are all networked for information. Reports that earlier took several hours for a receptionist or night auditor, are now churned out in minutes.

## LESSON  1 Overview

- l Food technology has helped develop organic vegetables, increased shelf life of the food, introduced frozen foods and brought in meat and dairy alternatives.
- l Future technology can bring in vast strides through virtual reality that permit guests to take virtual tours of the property including the rooms they will stay in and the restaurants that they will visit, in the comfort of their homes while visiting the propertys website.

Media: Media includes the press, travel writers, gourmet writers, television and radio, etc. The image of a hotel is important to the success of the business. However, its so fragile that one wrong news item can cause irreparable damage to the reputation of a hotel. A hotel stay is very personal to the people because every thing in a hotel has a direct impact on their personal well being, be it the bed sheets they sleep on or the food they eat. The media can make or break an establishment because a negative news item moves around fast by the word of mouth. Some of the ways to get good publicity are:

- l Special promotions
- l Participation in environmental issues
- l Set leadership in good community conduct by having ethical ways of doing business.
- l Provide employment
- l Adopting correct practices and procedures in the preparation of food.
- l Concern for hygiene and sanitation and following local laws on the subject.
- l Having a system of receiving guest comments and acting upon them.

The micro-environment which includes the immediate influences that impact daily work is a reality that all hotels have to take into account. The main factors of the micro-environment are:

Customers: They are the reason for doing business. The customer is the king and unless the establishment responds to their changing wants and habits, it is doomed for failure. Some of the concerns for customers are:

- l Their needs and wants.
- l The amount they are willing to pay.
- l Life style and habits
- l Their health and safety
- l Doing business ethically.
- l Giving them value for money.
- l Giving recognition and participation in the lodging and dining experience.

Employees: Employees are the ones who fulfil the objectives of the organisation and create the customer experience. The food service industry has the following concerns for and commitments towards the employees:

- l Availability of skilled workers.
- l Fulfilling the requirements of unions and labor laws.
- l Training of staff especially casual workers who are coming into this industry in large numbers.
- l Motivation of staff to give the customer the perfect guest experience.
- l Managing grievances.
- l Providing career advancement.

<!-- image -->

- l Turnover of staff due to competitive opportunities.
- l Hiring multi-lingual staff to serve varied customers.

Suppliers: They are a critical component of the business to deliver the raw materials of the right quality,  quantity  and  price  on  a  consistent  basis  to  do  business.  Some  concerns  in  this  area include:

- l Availability of reliable suppliers locally.
- l Availability of operational suppliers round the year.
- l Cost of imports of items not available locally.
- l Unanticipated changes in cost.
- l Reliability of goods.
- l Increasing transportation costs.

Services: The first are the local government agencies that represent the federal and local governments. They play an important role in any food and beverage operation. They are the ones who give permission to operate the business. Some of their influences are:

<!-- image -->

- l Providing the license to do the business.
- l Giving the license to operate restaurants and bars.
- l Municipal authorities who provide power, fuel and water connections, building permits, sewage disposal and garbage removal services.
- l Internal revenue that governs sales tax and income tax.
- l Fire Department that control the fire prevention measures.
- l Local police that approve parking, traffic flows and unethical behaviour. They also register company vehicles.
- l Local authority that governs hours of operation.
- l Health department that ensures proper health and hygiene standards in food preparation.
- l Pension authorities for depositing the companys contribution to employee pension funds.

Other service providers are the insurance agencies that insure the premises against loss. They provide medical insurance, injury insurance to the staff and if the policy of the establishment permits, even life insurance. Outlets may even insure their important assets like lifts, air-conditioning plant, generators, company vehicles, etc. Banks provide credit facilities, short-term and longterm  loans,  funds  transfers,  payroll  administration  (in  some  cases)  and  overdraft  facilities. Consultants provide advice on gourmet, set-up, facility planning, interior design and décor, investment, etc.

## Functions of Management

Management is a composite activity of different functions as given below:

The Finance and Accounting function: Finance deals with the raising and deployment of funds. The role is to make the owners funds productive and to invest it in such a manner that it multilpies so as to generate wealth. This wealth is then deployed in the improvement of the existing business or the creation of other businesses. Accounting is the process of recording the deployment of funds on a daily basis.

<!-- image -->

The Human Resources (HR) function: The HR function is to recruit the right talent into the organisation and get the maximum productivity out of them through motivation and leadership. Motivation is achieved through fair wages, proper working conditions and by addressing their personal handicaps.

The Marketing function: The marketing team provides professional expertise in understanding the market and the consumer segments. They identify the target segment/s and develop plans and actions to reach them, attract them and ensure they continue to return to do business. They also project the establishment as a responsible citizen of the society they operate in.

The Information Technology (IT) function: IT is expected to introduce the transformation of processes from manual to computerised systems. IT department maintains those systems and help users to effectively utilize those systems for their own benefit as well as the benefit of the organisation.

The Operations function: Operations is a joint term for the actual execution of what the business offers. Factory production of goods can be considered as operations while the organising and delivery of services in the service industry is considered operations.

The Maintenance function: A team of professional engineers keep the entire physical premises in working condition to do business. This is through various services which include carpentry, mechanical, civil, electrical, plumbing and water. They also ensure that essential utility services like energy and water is available to do business.

The Research &amp; Development function: It is understood by now that an establishment has to always innovate to get a cutting edge over competitors. While manufacturing sector has welldefined research facilities, the service sector can have dedicated food technology research centres, or make continuous improvement the way of life.

## Intrapreneurial Thinking

All housekeeping professionals have to become intrapreneurs i.e. those who apply entrepreneurial thinking to their workplace. The author has found it important, therefore, to discuss the application of marketing orientation to housekeeping operations. With the growth of the service industry, marketing pundits have brought in three Ps - Processes, Physical Evidence and People. Let us understand each of them.

## Processes

Processes are those procedures, mechanisms and flow of activity that ensure consistent standards. We must understand that service is provided by people and that the service experience, therefore, is dependent on the servers skills, motivations and attitudes. Since each human being is different, the service industry is challenged as to how to bring about common service standards customers can expect consistently without fear or apprehension. The hotel industry has developed procedural manuals for practically every process. These procedural manuals are the backbone to operations. Take housekeeping for example, where the guest expects a safe and functional room. Housekeeping builds this expectation into their room checklists ensuring that all maintenance requirements are met. The safety of employees is equally important. Housekeeping procedures build in safety instructions in the use of equipment; use of toxic chemicals; procedure for disposing garbage; etc. Then there is the matter of lost and found items of the guests. There are definite procedures that

## 102

ensure that guest belongings, misplaced and found, are safe for the guest to claim at a later date. Housekeeping has to ensure standards. Each room must have the same features when occupied by a guest. These standards are written and followed as a way of life. These processes ultimately benefit the guest and the employee.

## Physical Evidence

Service is an intangible thing. It is an experience. People want proof of such intangibles as they are comfortable with things that they can relate with their senses like sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste. Let us take an intangible concept like hygiene. A claim of the establishment that it has high standards of hygiene and sanitation is not good enough until the customers see the physical evidence of this. Claims without evidence are just empty words. A room attendant who is wellgroomed and wears a clean uniform is something that the customer can see as a proof of hygiene. A clean room and bathroom is another proof. A drinking goblet that is stainless in a guest room is a proof of hygiene. Freshness is another intangible, which a customer can experience by the air of the establishment, by the food they eat in the restaurant or by the freshness of bed and bath linen. These are all examples of physical evidence. How often have we been attracted to the smell of a freshly brewed coffee or hot breads? Sanitation signs across toilet seats or water goblets in rooms are examples of giving physical evidence of a concern for sanitation. Menu Cards are a very  strong  medium  to  give  evidence  about  the  products,  services  and  the  promise  of  the establishment. Physical evidence in services is, therefore, the process of making the intangible. Some of the intangibles that need to be made tangible are suggested in the table below:

| Intangibles          | Strategies to Make Them Tangible   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Comfort              | l Ergonomics in room beds          |
|                      | l Being explained the hotel policies l Being alert to a customers needs l Presenting the check in a folder l Not hanging around for tips l Personal hygiene of staff l Spotless glassware &amp; linen in rooms                                    |
| Hygiene &amp; Sanitation | l Polished furniture               |

| Efficiency  | l Double locking doors l Voltage signs in guest rooms for hairdryers and electric shavers l Response on telephone when making reservations l Being prompt to every guest need l Knowledge of hotel policies l Timeliness of service l Response to mishaps (guest needing medical attention in a room) l Response to guest objections l Energy of all staff |

These are just  some  intangibles.  There  are  many  more  important  ones  like  quality,  care, friendliness, etc. Each needs to be identified and made tangible through the products and service.

## People

The people who work in the service industry are the back bone of the service. It is they who give the service, especially the personal touch that automation cannot. The hotel trade, like other service-based industry, is skill-based where people convert their skills into their livelihoods. Some make those skills into an art form like the bartender and his art of mixing cocktails;  the housekeeper who prepares the perfect room; the flambé expert who makes meals beside the table with fanfare; and certainly the cooks who spearhead the dining experience with their art of cooking. The hotel industry has recognized the importance of the people who work in it and given a lot of importance to recruitment, training and career development.

Note: In recognition of the importance of people, the author had written a paper for the Caterer Magazine entitled  People as a Marketing Proposition . This has been reproduced at the end of this chapter as it is relevant to any student of hotel management.

## Summary

We have seen that management is a process of utilizing resources to meet business objectives. Resources are always in shortage and therein lies the challenge of managing. Each resource presents sets of dynamics that have to be professionally dealt with. Every organisation must know the direction in which they are going, to be in business. This is actualised through objectives. Objectives are set at different future periods and plans are devised to set out actions to achieve those goals. Marketing is a critical function of management. To understand it is the way to do business.

## PEOPLE AS A MARKETING PROPOSITION

It has been extolled that people are a critical factor in the service industry. With the prediction of the futurist Alvin Toffler in his book The Third Wave , that society is moving into the service age, we need to look at people who are fundamental to services such as those offered by hotels. So far,  a  lot  of  original  good  work  has  been  done  in  the  hotel  industry  to  develop  such  human resource systems whereby people are motivated and developed for higher potential. However, such efforts have always been confined within each hotel or hotel chain. Todays hotels tend to market their physical product, facilities and services promoting their features to the consumer. The purpose of this article is to stimulate some thought on looking at people as the marketing roposition to the customer.

The traditional marketing mix have been the four Ps i.e. Product, Pricing, Promotion and Place, in which packaging and selling are also included. Marketing pundits have brought out three additional Ps exclusive to the service industry. Which are People, Processes and Physical Evidence? This paper is attempting to highlight the People and seeing their significance in the traditional marketing mix. The proposition is as follows:

## 1. People Product

We know that tangible products have tangible and intangible attributes to a customer, at the time of purchase. Therefore, while Avon lipsticks are marketing a fashionable product, the intangible

<!-- image -->

that is marketed is Hope. Similarly, the Lux soap while marketing a well designed scented and packaged cleaner, the intangible that is purchased is Beauty. What we are seeing is that the tangible aspect of a product highlights features while the intangible highlights benefits. Transporting this idea to people as a product there are tangible and intangibles we need to consider. The tangibles are the physical attributes and features that appeal to the senses, such as grooming, personal hygiene, skills, etc. The intangibles, and, therefore the benefits that are offered are efficiency, security, etc. My recommendation is that progressive hotels could consider promoting the people intangibles.

Advertising slogans could read, Come to our hotel, our staff will take care of your needs, or our business staff are most efficient.

We all know that in marketing one must take care of customers needs and wants. These are amply researched in terms of the physical product. Have we ever researched into the customer needs and wants regarding the tangible and intangible aspects of hotel staff? To achieve a customer orientation one needs training and development approach from pure mechanistic skill orientation to human sensitivity. For example, a lady executive once arrived by a late flight and checked into the hotel and had an important meeting next morning. She needed a hair dryer. The answer she got from the receptionist was, I am sorry madam, and the beauty parlor has closed at 6 p.m. The receptionist response was not wrong from a mechanistic trained response. If the receptionist was trained in a human sensitivity point of view, she would have been sensitive to the guests need and found ways to provide her with a dryer. Futuristic training should also include creative training for frontline staff to generate several alternatives to solve a guest problem. On spot customer research through feedback could give cues into the psyche of customers so that we can provide them the intangibles they are looking for.

## 2. People Pricing

The pricing of goods is broadly done by totalling the raw material costs, conversion costs into finished product and a profit to arrive at a selling price. In people pricing too there is an input cost of recruitment, a conversion cost of training, plus their value to the organisation. The organisation must build this cost in their pricing of menus. The customer must be willing to pay for the perceived value of services offered by people.

## 3. People Promotion

When we see advertisements and promotions of hotels, what comes upfront to the customer are special cuisines, golfing facilities, renovated rooms, business centres, etc. Most hotels offer similar services and the quality of such services are marginally different. What could be a deciding factor to a customer is the kind of people that are bringing such facilities alive. The customer does not find the answer about the people that serve him He learns through trail and error which can have a long lasting effect on his future decisions. What he would like is some evidence of the quality of

<!-- image -->

human resources that will serve him before he actually experiences them. Here is the opportunity for hotel and restaurants to promote their people.

The New York Sheraton permitted its Executive Housekeeper to send letters on her own personal letterhead to all the regular clients inviting them to try out the newly renovated rooms and expressed her desire to personally welcome them. The hotel had put her upfront with the customers giving them the impression that the hotel had full confidence in their staff and did not mind a personal rapport of the non-marketing employees to interact with the customer. Similarly some hotels promote their Chef as a marketing proposition rather than the food. Hotels earlier displayed their best employees of the month on the staff notice board at the back of the house. Today many hotels have brought their staff achievers photographs into their lobbies for all guests to see. This gives the guest the confidence in the people that are serving them.

Packaging is an independent field of study and often considered the fifth P in marketing. A lot of money has been spent on packaging of traditional goods and customers are barraged with attractive packages on shelves of supermarkets and shops. Employees too can be packaged in a manner that makes them the unique proposition for the hotel. While uniforms, grooming and personal hygiene are physical elements of people packaging there are other intangibles that can be  packaged  into  physical  evidence  of  intent.  The  Sheraton  Management  Corporation  had developed a multi-million dollar peronalisation programmed which highlighted three attributes:

- 1. All employees must wear a smile.
- 2. All employees must greet the customer whether meeting them formally or casually.
- 3. All employees must take responsibility for any query of a guest and convert it into action.

Therefore, a maintenance engineer working on a bulb in the corridor would respond to a customer query about bar timings and if he did not know, would find out the timings or lead the guest to someone who would know the timings.

The employees in the Sheraton experience were all packaged to respond consistently on the belief that this would be their cutting edge proposition in service.

## 4. People Place

The positioning of employees in a hotel is done by the management. Have we ever asked the guest where they would like some hotel employees positioned? For example, we often enter a restaurant and have to wait a few minutes in discomfort before being attended to. The guest would like to have someone at the door to receive him. The restaurant management would then have ensured that a hostess was always available at the door. Perhaps reservationists can be positioned at source markets or airports? Or Security Guards on each guest floor?

In a world of growing service orientation, it is time that hotels make their people the unique marketing proposition.

## 2.1 LAYOUT OF THE HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT

## Introduction

There is no ideal or universal model for the layout of a housekeeping department. The layout differs from hotel to hotel and depends upon its size and the limitations of physical space. However, a housekeeper must be told the number of rooms, function rooms, public area facilities and the anticipated volume of business so as to plan and budget her operations. She will also determine whether to outsource some services like landscaping, flower arrangements, tailoring, upholstery, laundry etc. to be able to optimally utilize space. Hotel space is valuable and only that much space is utilised which is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of operations. It must be remembered that the investor has to make decisions whether to convert valuable space into revenue generating areas or submit to non-revenue activities such as housekeeping, which in an indirect way contributes to room sales. It is for this reason that the housekeeping department is located in the basement or ground floors, areas which are unsuitable for revenue facilities and termed as backhouse areas. There are a few considerations to be made when planning the housekeeping facilities:

- (a) It has to be accessible to all employees of the hotel as they will come to the uniform room for the issue and exchange of uniforms;
- (b) It has to be accessible to food and beverage personnel and floor supervisors for the exchange of linen;
- (c) The location has to be away from guest view and hotel staff traffic;
- (d) The area must be strong to install heavy equipment;
- (e) The laundry involves heavy duty washing machines, hydro-extractors and calendar machines etc. that rest well on sturdy flooring like the basement or ground floor;
- (f) The sound and vibration of equipment must not affect the quiet ambience required for guest living.

## Who Plans Housekeeping Facilities?

The task of creating the housekeeping spaces is given to a facility planner. Facility Planning is the activity of designing the layout of the operational service areas such as restaurants, kitchens, stewarding, laundry, housekeeping, etc. The design must take full advantage of space in creating the convenience of operations and a return on investment to the owner. This requires knowledge of preparing blueprints; service equipment and staff roles and skills. For example, housekeeping would like to have laundry operations in close proximity to its linen and uniform rooms. Facility planning will ensure that this is made possible. Facility planning ensures that the conditions required for various operations are met. All storage areas cannot have steam and hot water pipes running through them, while the laundry requires steam and hot water supplies. These considerations are meticulously looked into by the facility planner.

In  view  of  this  the  facility  planner  works  against  certain  objectives  when  planning  the housekeeping layout:

## Objectives of Facility Planner

- 1. To get a fair return on investment in space, furniture, equipment, fixtures and building materials.
- 2. To create a facility which could appeal to guests and employees so that they find it convenient, safe and hygienic.
- 3. To create a facility compatible with the housekeeping operations. No establishment wants unnecessary equipment and service ware.
- 4. To create a facility which could have an efficient flow of operations. This means that there should not be a conflict of movement of staff resulting in delays and operational safety.
- 5. To create a facility where the spaces could easily be kept according to the municipal standards of safety and sanitation.
- 6. To create a facility which could improve employee efficiency. The ergonomics must result in minimum movement with maximum productivity.
- 7. To create a facility which could ensure low maintenance costs. The equipment, furniture and fixtures must be durable and easy to maintain.
- 8. To create a facility where the design makes employee supervision easy.
- 9. To plan the facility in such a manner that it includes building materials, furniture, fixtures and equipment at the most economic price but of the best possible quality.

## Preliminary Considerations

Before any facility planning can commence, there are certain considerations that are necessary to be decided:

- 1. To determine the project team. The team would normally consist of the owner/general manager,  architect,  facility  planner,  housekeeper,  purchase  manager  and  the  financial controller.
- 2. To have the basic needs worked out. The housekeeper must be clear of her exact requirements to ensure that plans meet the operational requirements of the department.

- 3. To determine the type of service . The market segments that the hotel will service will largely decide the type of housekeeping service that will be provided. There is a vast difference between housekeeping services of a business hotel and a resort; a group hotel and an airport hotel. Then again, tower hotels will have different dynamics than those that are sprawled in large acreage.
- 4. Set specifications of equipment and furniture. The housekeeper, purchase manager and facility planner should conduct market surveys of equipment manufacturers and furniture warehouses to know exactly the spaces required by them when planning layouts.
- 5. Develop a blueprint. The architect is the best person to do it along with the facility planner. The blueprint is the architectural drawing of the establishment.

The Planning Process: With these preliminary considerations in place, we now move to the actual planning. Figure 2.1 gives a schematic representation of the planning process.

Fig. 2.1 The Planning Process

## Housekeeping Design Factors

- l Space: The  housekeeping  must  take  full  advantage  of  spaces  ensuring  security  and accessibility. This is the most expensive cost and will continue to be so in the future. The effective utilisation of space is the challenge to the facility planner. An important decision to make is  to  choose  those  items,  which  are  to  be  outsourced,  and  those  that  are  to  be prepared in-house. For example, an establishment may want to outsource laundry operations rather than use valuable space of the hotel for this purpose. There may be a decision to outsource the florist rather than use up a room for her. Upholstery refurbishing can be outsourced to agencies rather than blocking valuable space to create a yard.
- l Noise: The facilities must control noise which comes from noisy laundry equipment and verbal staff communication. The noise should not reach guest areas at any cost. Sound proofing is achieved by carpets, double doors, double window glazing and rubberized flooring materials.
- l Temperature: is important in places of extreme climate. Desert areas will need good airconditioning while cold climates will need effective heating. Temperature can have an adverse effect on textiles and equipment.

- l Freedom of movement: is essential for safety reasons. The corridors must have enough space for trolleys and other equipment.
- l Exchange counters: The uniform exchange room can be congested at certain times, especially mornings, when all the staff is in a hurry to get fresh uniforms for the day.
- l Storage: Housekeeping will need adequate storage to keep the volume of linen, uniforms, cleaning detergents, operational equipment, lost and found things, etc.
- l Cost: Obviously the cost of equipment, furniture and fixture depends on the type and quality of the establishment. The costs must be reasonable to be able to get a return on investment. This is possible by vigorous market survey, surfing the web and by getting referrals from others.
- l Quantity and quality: Equipment must be able to meet the quantities of linen and amenities provided. Expensive linen and uniforms will need special storage conditions to maintain them.
- l Equipment: There are several considerations in the selection of equipment:
- n The equipment must be cost-effective.
- n It must be durable.
- n It must have guarantees for replacement.
- n Spare parts must be cheap and easily available.
- n Technicians of the supplier are available readily at the time of breakdowns.
- n The lead times for procuring equipment coincide with the opening of the property.
- n The models of equipment can be replaced.
- n The equipment is easy to maintain and clean.
- n Equipment needs minimum facilities to get it working
- n Equipment must be safe. It should not present a fire hazard.
- l Utilities: These are the power, fuel, water and steam connections required to operate the housekeeping and laundry equipment. Utilities are expensive and provided by the government or  private  utility  companies.  The  utility  connections  must  be  easily  accessible  to  the housekeeping. The equipment must be so positioned as to access these connections without too many wires and pipes crossing the floor.
- l Sanitation and Safety: The  facility  design  must  be  easy  to  keep  safe  and  sanitised. Cleaning programmes by housekeeping personnel must have access to every corner of the facility especially those under heavy equipment. Service doors must be provided to access guest areas like the banquet halls, restaurants and bars. The facility must have stores for toxic chemicals.
- l Type of Service: The facility must suit the service style. Downtown business hotels that are built upwards may need efficient service elevators while chalet-type resort properties may require sturdy access roads to roll trolleys and carts. Distribution points for linen may vary. Busy hotels may have floor pantries on each floor or a set of floors, while chalet-type resort properties may need service huts to serve a given number of chalets.
- l Physical Fatigue: Fatigue is caused by too much movement, lack of climate control and carrying heavy loads. The facility planner must address these issues as the ultimate productivity of the workforce depends on it.

## Layout and Housekeeping Facilities

Fig. 2.2 Housekeeping Floor Plan

<!-- image -->

Figure 2.2 below gives the layout of a housekeeping department. It is a representative one only. It portrays the basic facilities required by a housekeeping department.

<!-- image -->

## Housekeepers Office

This  is  the  main  administration  centre  for  the  department.  It  must  be  an independent cabin to provide the housekeeper with silence to plan out her work. It  will  also  provide  her  the  privacy  to  counsel  her  staff  or  hold  departmental meetings. It should be preferably in glass paneling so as to give her a view of what is happening outside her office. The office should be preceded by a cabin for the secretary who would control movement into the housekeepers office.

## Desk Control Room

This is the main communication centre of housekeeping. It is from here that all information is sent out and received concerning the department. It is the nerve centre for coordination with the front office, banquets, etc. The desk control room should have a desk and chair  with  preferably  more  than  one  telephone.  It  should  have  a large notice board to display essential information for the staff. The desk control room is the point where all the staff members report for duty  and  check  out  at  the  duty  end.  It  would  ideally  adjoin  the housekeepers office.

<!-- image -->

## Lost and Found Section

This adjoins the desk control room. It is a space away from thoroughfare which is secure, cool and dry with a cupboard to store misplaced guest belongings that may be claimed later.

## Linen Room

This is where current linen is stored for issue and receipt. The room should be large and airy and free from heat and humidity. It should have adequate shelves to stack linen. It should be secure from pilferage. The linen room should have a counter across which the exchange of linen takes place. It should preferably adjoin the in-house laundry so that the exchange of linen between them is smooth and quick. Only authorised persons should be permitted to access the linen room. (See Lesson 7 entitled The Linen and Uniform Room for further details)

## Uniform Room

This room stocks the uniforms in current circulation. It is possible that smaller hotels may choose to combine this room with the linen room as shown above. A separate uniform room depends on the volume of uniforms in circulation. The uniform room will have hanging racks as most uniforms are best maintained when hung. (See Lesson 7 entitled The Linen and Uniform Room for further details)

## Housekeeping Store

The store stocks fresh linen and materials for uniforms. Ideally, the stock maintained should be enough to replenish the whole hotel allover once. However, due to budgetary constraints the hotel may stock less. Stocks in the store are only touched when the linen or uniforms in circulation fall short due to damage or loss. The room should be cool and dry. It is provided with shelves to stock the linen and materials. Larger hotels may have an independent store for linen and another for uniforms, based on the volume of materials in circulation and the policy of the hotel to stock such large numbers.

## Heavy Equipment Store

This is a store to stock bulky housekeeping equipment like vacuum cleaners, carpet shampoo machines, ladders for chandelier and window cleaning etc. The room should be clean and dry and securely locked to prevent pilferage or theft, as they constitute substantial capital investment.

## 114

## Tailor Room

This room is for in-house full-time tailors who stitch and mend damaged linen  and  uniforms.  The  room  typically  has  sewing  machines  with machining stations based on the number of tailors employed. Smaller hotels may outsource this function to reliable tailors in the city to save space and recurrent labor costs.

## Upholstery Yard

<!-- image -->

This is a space provided to store damaged upholstered furniture. Tailors specialised in re-upholstery work in this yard. Since furniture takes space, it requires adequate space to store them.

## Floor Linen Room (Pantry)

Each guest floor has a floor linen room to keep a supply of linen, guest supplies and cleaning supplies required to service the rooms on a floor. It acts as the housekeeping nerve centre for the floor. The floor linen room is situated at the end of floors or off the foyers of service elevators away from guest view. The pantry maintains a complete turnover of fresh linen to service all the rooms on the floor. The floor linen room is equipped with shelves and cupboards; hampers and a sink with a water supply for washing glasses; etc. (Please see Chapter 4 part 4.3 entitled, The Floor Linen Room for further details.)

## Flower Room

This room is used by the in-house florist who prepares flower arrangements for display at various parts of the hotel. Flowers beautify rooms and public areas. They are supplied to restaurants for table decoration and buffet displays. The room is airconditioned to keep the flowers fresh, provided with work tables to assemble the flower arrangements, a tap and

sink.

## Green House

This is an external facility to grow exotic plants that need special climatic conditions. Horticulture comes under the housekeeping and therefore, this facility is provided for by the housekeeper.

## Horticulture Equipment Store

<!-- image -->

There are a number of garden equipment such as lawn mowers, spades, rakes, pots etc. essential to gardening operations. These need to be stored safely. The store is an external facility easily accessible to gardeners. The size of the store increases as the area of landscaping increases.

## 2.2 ORGANISATION OF THE HOUSEKEEPING DEPARTMENT

## Introduction

The scope of housekeeping embraces the entire hotel. Naturally, the largest work force of the hotel belongs to the housekeeping department. It would be appropriate at this stage to ascertain as to who comprise the housekeeping department and what their roles are in brief. Figures 2.3 and 2.4 give the housekeeping organisation charts of a large and small property.

Fig. 2.3 Housekeeping Organisation Chart of a Large Property

<!-- image -->

We observe from the charts that housekeeping has six broad areas of responsibility:

- 1. The cleaning of guest rooms
- 2. The cleaning of public areas
- 3. The upkeep and exchange of linen and uniforms
- 4. The maintenance of external landscapes and gardens as well as internal flower arrangements
- 5. The management of the laundry.
- 6. Communications through the control desk

These responsibilities require expert human resources to fulfil themselves.

Fig. 2.4 Housekeeping Organisation Chart of a Small Property

<!-- image -->

Executive Housekeeper: Is the head of housekeeping and is responsible for translating hotel policies, procedures and standards into housekeeping operations. It is normally a womans role and part of the middle-management team. She represents the department at the General Managers meetings and ensures that all resources made available to her are effectively utilized.

Assistant Housekeepers: Head a shift as the housekeeping provides twenty-four hour service. They translate the Executive Housekeepers policies, procedures and standards into practice by communicating them to all the housekeeping supervisors and ensure that they actualise them at the grass root level of operations. They substitute the housekeeper in her absence and complete some administrative functions.

Floor Supervisors: Direct the cleaning and maintenance of guest rooms on allotted floors. They control the assets on the floor which include room attendants and housemen; bed and bath linen; guest and room amenities; and cleaning equipment and detergents. They are responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of guest rooms as per policies, procedures and standards set by the Executive Housekeeper. They supervise the exchange of floor linen with the laundry as well as ensure their proper storage in floor pantries. They give feedback to the front office on the occupancy status of guest rooms in each shift as a measure of controlling room sales and availability.

Control  Desk  Supervisor: This  is  a  vital  position  that  coordinates  communication  with housekeeping personnel spread to all parts of the hotel. Her major role is the coordination with the maintenance department to ensure that all maintenance requests are attended to. The desk is manned in all shifts as it is the lifeline for all staff. Smaller properties may make do with desk attendants rather than supervisors.

117

## 118

Room Attendants: Also called  chambermaid, housemaid or room maid where women are employed, are responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of allotted guest rooms as per set procedures and standards. They are the eyes and ears of the security team to report any untoward incidents. Room attendants ensure the privacy of guests at all times.

Housemen: They are the male cleaning personnel allotted to rooms and public areas to manage heavy cleaning duties. They move heavy furniture or vacuum long corridors of carpet. They help in the exchange of linen from floors because the sheer volume requires strong hands.

Linen Room Supervisor: Coordinates the exchange of soiled linen for fresh ones with a team of linen attendants. She is the custodian of the linen asset and ensures their security. She maintains proper storage conditions to minimise loss due to damage and loss. She works closely with the Laundry for the supply of clean linen.

Uniform Room Supervisor: Responsible  for  keeping  uniforms  in  safe  storage  conditions. Issues laundered uniforms to hotel staff against soiled ones, with a team of Uniform Room attendants and tailors. She too coordinates closely with Laundry for washing and dry cleaning schedules and maintains proper storage conditions.

Tailors/Upholsterers: They mend uniforms, linen and upholstery to give them longer life. Some hotels may have the tailors to stitch uniforms in-house. Smaller properties may outsource this activity.

Public Area Supervisor: Ensures the cleanliness, maintenance and aesthetic upkeep of all public areas like lobbies, restaurants, banquets space etc. with a team of housemen. Her area of control is very large and she has to be energetic to keep it under her close supervision.

Horticulturist: Is  responsible  for  the  upkeep  of  all  landscapes  and  gardens  with  a  team  of gardeners  based  on  the  area.  The  task  becomes  more  challenging  when  landscapes  include waterways, fountains, waterfalls, rockeries, etc.

Florist: She is responsible for all internal flower arrangements for guest rooms, public areas, banquet buffets, etc. She may be given an additional charge of maintaining a florist shop for sale of flowers and bouquets to resident guests and the public.

Gardener: Responsible for the upkeep of an allotted area of a landscape. He may be required to maintain internal plants and roof gardens also where required.

Laundry Manager: Normally a male has a large brigade of washer men, drycleaners, ironers, etc which are discussed in detail in Lesson 10 entitled Laundry Services .

Future Perspectives: Future hotels are likely to outsource the housekeeping function to professional housekeeping companies who would have certified themselves with a high quality of service. The hotel may keep a skeleton staff for linen and uniform room activity, emergency checkouts and check-ins and lost &amp; found activity. Hotels have already begun to outsource public area cleaning and horticultural activities.

## 2.3 JOB DESCRIPTIONS OF HOUSEKEEPING PERSONNEL

## Introduction

A job description is a written description of a job performed by a job holder. It specifies the parameters within which a job is done. These parameters include the duties and responsibilities, reporting relationships, authority and control, coordination with other departments, status within a departmental hierarchy and the broad scope of the function. A job description offers the following advantages to both the job holder and the organisation:

- 1. The new recruit knows exactly what his or her job entails. This in itself is a vital part of induction.
- 2. A job description acts as a basic foundation to set standards of performance. This informs the exact standards expected of a job holder.
- 3. The job description ensures a common perception of the job by both the superior and the subordinate.
- 4. It acts as a legal document for any disputes arising out of a lack of role clarification.
- 5. It  protects an employee from an unreasonable superior who may like to overburden an employee through unnecessary role deviations.

In addition, a job description includes a job specification which profiles the person in terms of education, experience, skills and competencies to perform a job. Some organisations may develop them separately, but the modern practice is to include it in the job description itself.

## Executive Housekeeper

This is one of the most important positions in the hotel since it carries the responsibility for the cleanliness, maintenance and aesthetic appeal of facilities so  that  they  are  sanitary,  desirable,  and  in  saleable  condition.  The  good housekeeper, because of the need to cooperate with many other department heads, must possess a high degree of tact as well as good organising ability. This is a management position that commands respect from all the members of the hotel.

## Night Supervisor

The night supervisor is the representative of the housekeeping department at night. Normally the evening shift would have done the service leaving all occupied rooms ready for night use by guests. The only requirement at night would be second services. However, in metropolitan cities with well-connected international and domestic flights, train arrivals and boat traffic, where check-

out and arrivals can be busy, the night supervisor is kept busy with a limited workforce at hand. Even though the check-out time is 12 noon in most hotels, many guests catching late night transports may stay on till their convenient check-out time. The other aspect of night duty is the cleaning of public area. Most restaurants, bars and banquets would have closed at late hours when the public area cleaning crew takes over their cleaning chores to prepare the facilities for the next day. Shopping arcades, executive offices, elevators, lobbies and foyers are cleaned at night when there is least guest traffic. The night supervisor mans the housekeeping control desk from where she coordinates the crews on the floors and public areas. She would also be the person to resolve additional guest  requirements  and  complaints  regarding  housekeeping.  The  night supervisors role is a rotational duty among the supervisors to give all the unique experience to the guest.

## Public Area Supervisor

She is the most challenged in a hotel because her responsibility expands over large public areas including external areas, lobbies, function rooms, public cloak rooms, corridors, foyers, elevators, etc. Naturally this requires physical fitness to walk long distances in her supervisory role. She leads a crew of housemen who are trained  to  clean  different  surfaces.  Good  Executive Housekeepers would rotate the supervisors for their all round development between floors and public areas. Since a large hotel may have extensive public areas the tasks of completing the entire hotel is spread over two shifts. There would be a public area supervisor for each shift.

## Linen/Uniform Room Supervisor

Her basic role is to issue uniforms and linen to staff according to prescribed systems and procedures. She is accountable for the movement of linen to the floors and food and beverage areas as also of uniforms to all hotel personnel. She coordinates closely with the laundry department exchanging soiled linen and uniforms for fresh ones on a strictly one-to-one basis. While it is prudent to rotate all supervisors through the various functions of housekeeping this position is largely a specialist one that pins accountability and responsibility for such a large asset. She is assisted by attendants and helpers.

The houseman has two roles: (a) to support the room attendants with heavy work and (b) to be the primary cleaner of public areas. In either case, his job involves heavy physical work such as vacuuming carpets and corridors, cleaning large window panes,  carrying  heavy  furniture,  garbage  clearance,  floor  scrubbing,  etc.  The houseman is essential to the strenuous demands of a hotel and everyone leans on them for difficult tasks.

## 2.4 COMPETENCIES OF A HOUSEKEEPING PROFESSIONAL

## Competencies

Competencies are a set of behavioural traits and technical abilities that are suitable for a job. While  new  technical  abilities  are  covered  extensively  in  Introduction  part  iv.   The New Housekeeping Professional  (readers are urged to read it along with this chapter) we shall look at  behavioural  sets  required.  We  have  seen  in  the  preceding  chapters  that  the  role  of  the housekeeping  professional  has  changed  dramatically.  They  are  empowered  with  more responsibilities. While housekeeping personnel require a set of knowledge and skills, they also require a set of behaviours that complete the professional profile. We have seen in Introduction, in the section  Understanding Guest Service , that attitude create beliefs that breed habits and consequently, behaviours. The housekeeping professional is obliged to develop certain attitudes that are a must for the role. These attitudes translate into behaviours called competencies. Recruiters give importance to competencies while hiring for the housekeeping. Here are some competencies that are age old and some that are new in keeping with the times.

## Smile!

Many of us may have forgotten how we look when we smile. Many have even forgotten to smile! Yet it is the most enduring competency required of housekeeping professionals, especially those in guest contact. As simple as it may seem, it is the most effective way of dealing with guests. A smile gets a smile in response. It immediately breaks down several barriers of a guest including fatigue, low spirits, doubt, anxiety, etc. Recruitment personnel see it as the first sign of housekeeping professionalism at the

<!-- image -->

time of interview. It is recommended that professionals smile in front of the mirror and assess their competency in it. Keeping a smile, while speaking on the telephone, is a powerful way to convey tone and intention to customers who judge the caller by the voice. We must not forget that housekeeping personnel are in direct contact with guests in guest rooms, on the floor and in public areas. While care is taken to be as unobtrusive to guests as possible, contact with them is inevitable.

## Grooming and Hygiene

Grooming is  one  of  the  most  important  features  of  housekeeping professionals. The room attendant, floor supervisor, houseman, public area personnel and cloak room attendants have face-to-face contact with the guests of the hotel. S/he, therefore, reflects the image of the property. A well-groomed housekeeping member represents qualities of hygiene, professionalism, management style, reliability, etc.

Here are some tips for a male housekeeping professional:

- 1. Hair should be cut close.
- 2. The uniform should be spotless and well ironed. A tight or oversized uniform gives a sloppy appearance.

<!-- image -->

## 144

- 3. Nails should be well manicured and hands absolutely clean. This is important especially since housekeeping personnel deal with the most intimate part of the guests staythe room.
- 4. Staff must guard against body odours or cheap perfumes. The market has some wonderful anti-perspirants.
- 5. Shoes should always be polished, and of a conservative style.
- 6. A close shave is necessary before starting duty. Stubbles of a beard or moustache could look uncomely.
- 7. Bad breath could be nauseating to a guest since a houseman could speak to the guest at close proximity.
- 8. Uniforms must be crisply ironed and clean.

Some tips for a female housekeeping professional:

- 1. The elastic hair band should always be clean.
- 2. High heels could be physically strenuous to the women as they have to be on their feet for a complete shift. Flat shoes with sturdy heels are advisable.
- 3. Stockings should be clean.
- 4. It is preferred to have a light make-up to project a professional working image.
- 5. Excessive jewelry should be avoided.
- 6. A very strong perfume could leave its presence in a room. Some guests could get nauseated. Fresh light cologne would be preferable.
- 7. Uniforms must be crisply ironed and clean.

## Basic Etiquettes

The hotel business is an alchemy of showmanship, diplomacy and sociability. All front line personnel are  required  to  have  the  ability  to  communicate  effectively  with  certain manners and etiquette associated with being a good host.

The basic etiquettes that a housekeeping member should exhibit are to:

- 1. Smile  and  attend  to  guests  as  soon  as  they  approach  them. Acknowledge their presence by wishing them as per the time of the day.
- 2. Recognize guests. Recognition is a powerful tool to use for regular guests. The use of their name gives them importance and a feeling of belonging.

<!-- image -->

- 3. Be polite to guests by frequently using terms such as Thank you, Please, May I help you?, Excuse me, Pardon me, etc.
- 4. Avoid mannerisms such as touching the hair, scratching oneself or picking the nose, etc.
- 5. Stand erect at all times.
- 6. Listen carefully to needs of the guests. Note down their requests and room number.
- 7. Assist guests wherever possible, especially in providing them information about hotel services. This requires thorough knowledge of hotel services. Take action on the request immediately.

- 8. Talk softly.
- 9. Avoid arguing with service staff and guests on the floors and public areas.
- 10. Carry pencils in the pockets and not behind ears or clipped in front of the uniform.
- 11. Desist from chewing gum or beetle nut.
- 12. Enter and leave the floor through the service door only.
- 13. Shut the doors quietly.

## Orderliness

Guests evaluate a property by how orderly the hotel personnel are. They observe whether the maid carts are kept clean and in an orderly fashion. Corridors must be kept clean and free from litter.

- 1. Keep all linen and supplies in the maids cart in an orderly manner.
- 2. Ensure that flower displays in rooms and floor foyers are fresh and properly arranged. Contact the florist if necessary.
- 3. Keep the access door to the service landings closed at all times. Most properties install a swing door with a peep window.
- 4. Floor foyer telephone tables must be kept clean at all times. A handy duster is helpful to keep the counter tops clean and polished.
- 5. Ensure that cigarette urns in the foyer are cleared of cigarette butts regularly.
- 6. Garbage hampers are essential features of a maid cart and garbage chutes important in service landings.

## Teamwork

Teams have become the cornerstones of service operations. A  poor  team  performance  can  severely  damage  the establishments reputation, while superior team performance directly  enhances  it.  Teamwork  is  one  of  the  essential competencies  at  the  time  of  recruitment.  Results  are  the responsibility of the entire team and not the team leader alone. Team dynamics have changed over the years. Let us understand the anatomy of teamwork.

<!-- image -->

What is a team? A team is a small interdependent group of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.

The key words are interdependence, complementary skills and accountability. No one person can deliver any goal. It takes a team to deliver results with complementary specialisations and the desire to accomplish objectives and taking responsibility for a success or failure.

Why should we have teams? Teams can meet significant performance challenges. They have a  common purpose and are able to assist  when  a  team  member  is  slow.  They  harness  the complimentary skills of other team members and have trust in their competency. They can influence each other to be ethical, disciplined and motivating.

Who is the team in a housekeeping operation? The direct teams are the floor supervisors with their coterie of room attendants and housemen; the public area supervisor with her team of housemen. The indirect teams are the head gardener with his team of gardeners; the linen/ uniform supervisor with her team of attendants and helpers; maintenance personnel who rectify engineering problems; and the laundry who supplies fresh linen and uniforms, etc.

What is the team leaders role? The team leaders role is to build commitment to the common purpose. He or she fills in gaps in competencies; delegates leadership; is a hands-on performer with the team; makes key decisions and manages external relationships including the management, guests, and suppliers.

What are the qualities of the team members? They are all performers who find excitement in  their  performance.  They  take  ownership  of  the  task  and  objectives  and  hold  themselves accountable for success or failure. They have a sense of urgency with youthful enthusiasm and energy. They are result oriented and respect each other.

## Attitude

Attitude is a buzzword in modern operations. We wear an attitude. In other words, attitudes is something that we own and are responsible for. It comes from within and can be positive or negative,  based  on  ones  experiences.  Let  us  take  an  inventory  of  key  attitudes  required  in housekeeping operations:

- 1. The joy of serving people. The benefits of service are many. People are giving business to those who have better service. A good service gets better paychecks and tips. It ensures repeat customers. Service is the cutting edge.
- 2. A cheerful attitude is an asset. It is infectious and spreads cheer  and  goodwill  to  others.  It  fosters  a  pleasant  and tension-free workplace.
- 3. Cooperation is vital in team performances. Unless one does not cooperate with others they will not cooperate with you.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Pride in ones work brings excellence. There is a difference between doing routine work and doing work with an aim to make a difference. Service can be done with showmanship, sincerity and enthusiasm.
- 5. Initiative is a valued competency in todays world. The only way to beat competition is to innovate and bring in new ideas. Each housekeeping professional must always look for new ideas and introduce them. Some may have the benefit of directly introducing new ideas, while others will need to seek the approval of superiors. Continuous improvement or Kaizen is a science brought in by the Japanese, which has made them an economic giant.
- 6. Salesmanship is a vital job requirement to motivate the guest to spend that extra dollar.
- 7. Honesty is a precious attribute. There are many temptations in a service operation. There are  opportunities  for  theft  of  property  and  guest  belongings;  misleading  guests  with information; giving secrets to competitors etc. Organisations value and reward employees who are upright and truthful.

(Read  Understanding Guest Service  in Introduction to know how we can develop positive attitudes)

## Self-Discipline

Discipline is the hallmark of a good housekeeping professional. This is because the temptations in a hotel are many. Discipline is of two types- physical, where grooming and physical conduct play a role, and mental, which demands sincerity, honesty and perseverance. Here are some tips for housekeepers and supervisors to prevent indiscipline.

- 1. Update oneself continuously with the house rules and regulations.
- 2. Make disciplined behaviour bring reputation, recognition, better rewards.
- 3. Act professionally at work by being businesslike in actions and conversation.
- 4. Amend mistakes immediately.
- 5. Always air grievances in privacy.
- 6. Be an example to others.
- 7. Improve skills by training to avoid mistakes that may be viewed as indiscipline.

Given below, on the left are the common reasons for the indiscipline shown by the employee, while on the right side are the suggested positive ways in which the employee can look at them.

- (a) Unavoidable circumstances
- (b) Adventurism
- (c) System of control
- (d) Ignorance of rules
- (e) To attract attention

Get attention by excellent performance.

- (f) Does not accept the system
- (g) Rebel
- (h) Affiliation with negative groups

Negative groups are counter-productive to good  performance. Associate with winners.

- (i) Bad habits

Cultivate good habits.

- (j) Takes short cuts

Distinguish  between  innovation  and  taking  short  cuts. Innovations do not harm the organisation, while short cuts do.

Clarify problems and doubts openly with the superiors and if not satisfied seek alternate employment.

Rebels are those who bring about change. Change can be instituted through dialogue and cooperation with superiors and not by rebellion.

Sometimes there are sickness or pressing domestic demandsthis  is  normally  excused  provided  this  is  not  too  regular. Inform the superior in advance for her to make alternative arrangements. Remember your team needs you.

The desire to be different can be converted into challenges at the work place. Ask the supervisor for additional tasks.

Self-regulation is one of the empowerment tools given to modern professionals.

It is important to update oneself constantly with the current rules and regulations. Clarify rules during briefing. Ignorance of rules is a crime.

## Courtesy

- 1. It is the hallmark of a good housekeeping professional to be courteous on all occasions not only towards guests, but also towards colleagues and other people working in the same unit.
- 2. Courtesy should be inherent in ones nature and a sign of ones desire to please those with whom one comes into contact with. Courtesy should not just be a part of the technique  of  the  property  but  be  spontaneous  and genuine.
- 3. The advantage and necessity of being courteous should be emphasized as it not only smoothes operations, but also ensures better relationships.

Examples of courtesy are given below:

<!-- image -->

- (a) Each approaching guest must be attended to with a smile and a cheery greeting.
- (b) If the staff member knows the guests name, it is advisable to address him or her by the name as this gives the guest recognition. Do not mispronounce names or call them by somebody elses name!
- (c) If rooms are not ready when a resident guest arrives, ask them if you should return later. If they permit you to continue, complete the task quietly and quickly.
- (d) When a guest is seeking assistance on the floor use the word assist, e.g. May I assist you or May I be of assistance.
- (e) When listening to requests or complaints of the guests show empathy and tell them what you will do to meet that need or resolve the complaint. Then do it. A guest must not remind housekeeping about the issue again
- (f) After completing any transaction say, Thank you, have a pleasant day. It should be said with utmost sincerity.

## Intrapreneurship

Intrapreneurship is a new term for internal entrepreneurship. Housekeeping professionals are required  to  think  like  businesspersons.  They  should  constantly  evaluate  the  housekeeping performance and finds ways to improve. They should be resourceful to meet emergency situations. Productivity is a process that improves business performance. The intrapreneur will constantly listen for clues and leads to improve performance. The housekeeping thinks in terms of dollars and how to give the owner his or her return on investment.

## Continuous Education

Housekeeping professionals will be required to upgrade themselves constantly. They should not wait  for  the  organisation  to  improve  their  knowledge  and  skills  but  take  initiative  for  selfdevelopment. This they can do by subscribing to relevant trade magazines, learn through websites, attend seminars, join professional bodies that advance knowledge, or go back to hotel school to learn. Organisations expect the true professional to convert new ideas into business opportunities

for the hotel and are willing to reward such enterprise. A follow-up on learning is certification. Professionals can call themselves as such only when they show some physical proof of their learning. The cry of the future professional must be to get more technical qualifications.

## Customer Orientation

We have learnt by now that the customer is the king (or queen). Unless a hotel or its people do not put the customer as their main focus the business is likely to decline. Customer focus means putting all thoughts and actions towards creating positive customer experiences. To be able to do this is empathy, which is proverbially said as putting yourself in the guests shoes. It requires sensitivity to the needs of the guests and responding to them in a timely manner. If a lady guest requires a hairdryer in the middle of the night, she must have it! Excuses for inaction are many but going that extra mile to provide the guests needs makes the difference between one hotel and another.

## Physical Fitness

The television has rightly or wrongly exposed the public to the dream figures and presentation of housekeeping professionals. A housekeeping professional must be physically fit to manage rigorous hours on his/her feet. There is a saying that a healthy body makes a healthy mind. It is very true. If a person is physically fit it translates  into  energy,  enthusiasm,  ability  to  cope,  lightness,  youth  and  joy. Housekeeping professionals must bring in physical fitness regimes into their personal lives.  It  may  be  just  an  hours  walk  in  ones  neighbourhood  or  a  workout  in  a gymnasium.

<!-- image -->

## Eye for Detail

Housekeepers worldwide have been known for their eye for detail. This term means that the person has a sharp eye for things that are not quite right. It is in search of this competence that women have been selected as housekeepers. The belief is that women have a greater eye for detail coming from their roles at home. Men have come into housekeeping and also shown this competence over  the  years.  This  competence  repeatedly  appears  in  all  housekeeping  job descriptions.

## Summary

A housekeeping professional is a package of behaviours called competencies. They need to be cultivated just as much as knowledge and skills. Competencies go hand in hand with any certification one may have.

## Duties of an Executive Housekeeper

## 3.1 HOUSEKEEPING MANPOWER PLANNING

## Housekeeping Staff

Having decided on the physical layout and facilities of the housekeeping department, the next task for the housekeeper is to decide on how many people should comprise her work force. This is a critical factor as ad hoc recruitment could result in an excess work force and high wage bills. The number of people would depend upon the structure of the hotel, i.e. block construction or clusters of rooms, number of floors and the number of rooms per floor, number of public areas, size of landscape etc. However, as a guide to housekeepers, given below are certain common norms to aid in determining the manning strength.

The key strategy for the Housekeeper is to multi-task resources. Supervisors must be rotated among public areas, control desk and night duties; housemen must be rotated between floors and public areas; all press operators in the laundry must be rotated to all the types of presses and preferably, to the tasks of the washer man and drycleaners as well; Linen and uniform room supervisors must interchange with each other. This strategy gives the housekeeper to deploy her human resources at pressure points in daily operations. It helps her staff to enlarge their skills and experience.  Multi-tasking helps in filling leave vacancies and her dependency on any resource is reduced. There are some roles that are strictly specialist like that of the horticulturist, florist and the Laundry Manager. Such positions have capable deputies in supervisory positions to fill in absences of the positions.

We must realise that the complexion of some hotels may change. They may be a part of larger complexes called communities that are integrated activities of malls, pleasure centres, residential apartments and business blocks. If so, the Executive Housekeeper will have separate brigades for each activity, which is not in the scope of this book.

The Executive Housekeeper must also examine how she can empower her team members by enriching their jobs with additional tasks and responsibilities. The payroll is efficient when she has few highly skilled workers than many less skilled ones. This depends on the labour market and the availability of competent people locally.

Constant training is the only way that an Executive Housekeeper can achieve better productivity, motivation and efficiency.

## 3.2 RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION

## Introduction

The greatest  challenge  facing  the  hospitality  industry  is  the  human  resource  as  they  are  the backbone of the industry. Properties compare equally in terms of architecture, décor and product offered in the same price range and market segment. Investors have spent millions in vying to outdo each other in the physical aspects of building hotels that look almost similar. The basic requirements in the hotel business are the same, i.e.  rooms,  bathrooms,  telephone  services, engineering services etc. of a certain standard. The question that arises then is how does an investor achieve a cutting edge over its nearest competitor? It is achieved by the people who work in it and the standards of service they provide to the customer. It is universally acknowledged that the employees of a service-oriented industry are the difference between a good and bad experience.

Readers may claim that the labour market is full of people then why should the availability of the human resources pose a challenge? The truth is that the problem is not the number of people in the market, but getting the right people. In many parts of the world like Europe, North America and Japan, the birth rate has fallen to the extent that it is not keeping pace with the replacement requirements. This is the problem in those countries where demand is more than supply even in numbers. In regions with large working populations like South Asia, South America and Africa, the shortage lies in the availability of qualified personnel. Though the hospitality sector attracts the largest share of the job market, such people are mostly casual workers, primarily students who work in their school breaks to finance their education. Most would not continue in the hospitality sector after their education. The hospitality sector does face the challenge to attract the best talent of the society who may opt for engineering, medicine and business management. Though there is an appreciable shift in the attitude of people towards the service sector, getting the right people is still a challenge.

In  Lesson  2.4  entitled   Competencies of a Housekeeping Professional, we  saw  the competencies required of the human resources that work in the hospitality industry. Getting those competencies is not easy because it takes very special people who have the flair and desire to serve people and enjoy it. Skills may be taught but attitude is inborn in any individual as we saw in the Part of Introduction entitled  Understanding Guest Service . It requires professional human resource practices to get the right people for the right job and thereafter maintain them at a high level of motivation to serve the guest well, and retain them. With the result, owners compete to get  the  few  talented  people  available  thereby  skewing  salary  scales  and  creating  ill  will  with competitors. The hiring process starts in the planning stages, well before a person is even contacted in the labour market. Let us examine those steps in human resource planning that make a difference in the hiring process.

## Organisation of a Human Resources Department

The hospitality industry has appreciated the role and contribution of human resource specialists. We have recognised by now that people make the difference in the guest experience. Getting the right talent, training them and motivating them to excellence require several specialisations as we shall see later in the chapter. An owner of small properties like motels and resorts may assume this  responsibility.  Well-established  medium-sized  organisations  may  at  least  have  a  Human Resource  Manager  who  will  outsource  many  of  the  specialisations.  Large  hotels  will  have

156

well-defined HR structures to fulfil the various specialisations. A typical HR organisation structure of a large hotel would look like the following:

<!-- image -->

## Pre-recruitment Activity

The process starts with preparing a job description. A job description profiles the duties and responsibilities of a job. This is achieved through a job analysis discussed later. Once the job has been profiled then comes the aspect of profiling the person to do that job in a document called the job specification. Job specifications too are gathered from job analysis.

Recruitment and selection can only be done against specifications set for a job. A job specification profiles the person required to do the job. To arrive at a job specification there are many other tasks to be completed. These are explained in Fig. 3.1 below:

<!-- image -->

- A basic understanding of each is essential to a student and food service professional.

## Job Analysis

A Job Analysis determines the broad elements of a job. This step is important and has to be accurate as all the following tasks faithfully follow what is recorded in this exercise. If we were to take the example of a Room Attendant, his or her job analysis would generally look like this in Fig. 3.2:

Fig. 3.2 Job Analysis

<!-- image -->

The above information has been obtained by:

- l Observation: The person doing the job analysis can simply note a Room Attendant doing his  or  her  job,  over  a  period  of  a  week  and  list  the  components  of  the  job  that  occur regularly and infrequently. The aim and benefit of observing over a week is to determine repetitive jobs from those done occasionally. The ones done repetitively become the core of the job. This may be further confirmed by observing others in a similar role.
- l Interviewing: This is a method of questioning the employees, supervisors, managers and customers as to their expectations and perceptions of the job. A server does not work in isolation. His or her efforts impact others in the service chain. For example, a Cashier may want the receptionist to clarify in advance the mode of payment when settling bills, at the time of registering them. This helps the cashier from quick processing of the guest bill settlement. Then again a guest may want the receptionist to pre-register him or her to avoid delays at the time of arrival after a long flight. These expectations can be brought in as a component of the job if required.
- l Brainstorming: This is a method to get servers and those influenced by his or her work, like the supervisor, fellow servers, kitchen personnel, support departments etc. to sit in a room and discuss the job elements. The brainstorming can also be done by experienced people of the industry.
- l Review of existing job descriptions: This is a common method employed. Other existing job descriptions are taken from other hotels or textbooks and modified to the needs of the establishment.
- l Work sampling: Is a method of actually doing the job over a period of time and determining the job components by oneself. This is a tedious method as it is time-consuming but, at the same time, it is a sure method. Often supervisors are asked to develop the job elements as they have the exact know-how which they have gathered over a span of time.

## 158

- l Guest comments: Many  establishments  install  a  written  guest  feedback  system  for improvements in products and services. A questionnaire is presented to the guest at the end of their stay, which guests fill on a purely voluntary basis.
- l Role Clarification: Role  clarifications  are  conducted  by  professional  companies  as  a measure of recording the contributions of its employees. The appraisals note the expectations and contributions of the superior and the subordinate. It also states the employees own perceptions of the role.
- l Hiring outside consultants: They have the know-how through experience to give an accurate account of a job or may do the exercise of Job Analysis and the following tasks for a consultancy fee.

## Task List

Once the process of the job analysis, which spells out the broad components of the job, is complete the focus moves over to the next step of listing the tasks in each component. This process is called the Task List. The Task List is shown in Fig. 3.3 and it focuses on:

- l Specific duties
- l Work units
- l Materials
- l Equipment
- l Administrative tasks
- l Other requirements

Fig. 3.3 Task List

If we conisder the example of the job analysis of a Room Attendant mentioned above, we will see that one job component is called Deposit Soiled Linen. The tasks of the room attendant within the broad component of depositing soiled linen are reflected in the job list given below. This  Task  List  clarifies  the  establishment,  the  department,  the  job  position  and  the  function concerned.

This List brings out the following tasks of the activity of depositing soiled linen:

Specific Duties: When the soiled linen hamper of the maid cart is full, roll the cart to the floor linen room and deposit the bed and bath linen in the soiled linen hamper of the floor. Shake out each linen item once again for hidden guest articles. Give the count of each item to the Floor Supervisor.

Work Units: The list gives units like the time when soiled linen is deposited.

Materials: In this case, the material handled is bed and bath linen.

Equipment: Maid cart; soiled linen hamper of the cart; soiled linen hamper of the floor linen room.

Administrative tasks: Give the count of each item to the floor supervisor.

## Job Descriptions

The Task list gives the information for a job description. A job description is a written profile of a job. A job analysis and a task list ascertain this. A typical job description is given below in Fig. 3.4:

| Job Title:                | Room Attendant                                                                                                                                                 |

## Job Specification

A job specification is a written document that profiles the person who has to do a given job. It is the most important document for the hiring process. A job specification is driven by the following sub-headings:

- l Job Title
- l Category
- l Education
- l Experience
- l Skills
- l Competencies
- A specimen of a job specification of the Room Attendant continues here in Fig. 3.5.

## Sources of Human Resources Supply

Sourcing is the process of identifying qualified human resources from the market. There are two generic sources from where human resources may be procured. They are internal sources and

Fig. 3.5 Typical Job Specification

<!-- image -->

external sources . Internal sources are within an organisation while external sources are those outside an organisation. Lets look at each source.

## Internal Sources

- l Promotions: When a job vacancy occurs, the best source to fill the position is from within the  organisation  by  promoting  someone  who  is  junior  and  ready  to  take  the  position. Organisations have career development programmes and succession plans as a way to fill positions from their existing staff itself. This gives employees growth and a tremendous motivation to stay with an organisation. Motivational studies have shown that growth and advancement are strong motivators. While growth refers to any increase in knowledge and skills, advancement is the movement up the career ladder. Flatter organisation structures find it a challenge to provide advancement. However, this is managed by job enlargement which is the expansion of the job role by adding more duties and enrichment which is the assignment of better quality of tasks like managerial tasks, to a servers job.
- l Lateral transfers: These are transfers of existing employees who are either doing similar jobs in another section or branch of the organisation, or from another unrelated department in the organisation, as part of a larger individual development plan. An example of this would be the process of a telephone operator to front-desk duties, or a counter staff at the delicatessen who feels confident with customer interface to the front office. These are the quickest ways to fill vacancies without having to induct a new person into the cultural style of  the  organisation.  This  source  becomes  especially  important  in  filling  critical  posts immediately.

## 162

- l Networking with employees: This is a cost effective way to fill a post by asking existing employees to recommend friends, relatives or past associates to fill the post. The benefit of this is that the employee feels secure to bring in a friend and will cooperate fully to make that person productive soon.
- l Talent Bank: A talent bank is an inventory of drop-in eligible candidates during the year. Job seekers keep applying to an organisation even though the organisation has no vacancy and has not advertised for a post. Such drop-in applicants can be interviewed and, if found suitable, can be kept on a waiting list in the talent bank which is a filing cabinet with such applications. These applications have to be updated periodically to check the availability of the candidates who could have taken another job over the time. Most organisations review these talent banks every six months by contacting the candidates and asking them if they are still available. This is another cost effective method as it saves the costs of advertising or paying a recruitment agency.
- l Job Postings: These are the announcements of the vacancies on notice boards. Many organisations prefer to give first opportunity to its employees to apply for a vacancy. There are those who can get a career rise while others who may want the advertised job as their preferred career choice to the one they are presently doing. These vacancies are posted on the employee notice board located in the Human Resource Department.
- l Cross Training: It is the training of employees in related job positions. The hospitality industry  has  set  the  lead  in  cross  training  giving  managements  the  flexibility  to  deploy workers in different departments when the need arises. A progressive organisation would rotate new recruits through various functions to give them an appreciation of other positions, develop additional skills and have the flexibility to deploy them wherever required.
- l Internships: Establishments, who anticipate a high turnover of staff due to competitive environments, conduct induction training of raw recruits as a way to keep the supply of trained human resources to the organisation.

## External Sources

- l Recruitment Agencies: They are the most popular external source from which recruitment can be done. Recruitment agencies keep applications in their talent banks. They are able to produce interested candidates immediately. The organisation pays the agency a fee, for this service, which is either fifteen days or a full months gross salary of each employee selected.  Sometimes they work on a percentage of gross salary (about 10-15%) which comes to a months salary. The benefit of this source is that the recruitment agent conducts the preliminary interviews to save time for the appointing organisation and is able to produce a number of relevant applications.

l

Hotel Management and Craft Schools

are wonderful sources to recruit from, as the

- students have already made career choices for the hospitality industry and are specifically  educated  and  trained  for  it.    Such  institutes  hold campus placement activity when students complete their education by inviting the industry to conduct their interviews and selections.
- l Employment Agencies: These  are  the  public  agencies,  run  by  the government of each country, to provide the unemployed population a

<!-- image -->

common forum to get jobs. They keep applications of candidates from government run institutions.

- l Colleges: These are colleges other than the hotel schools. Students want to work to meet tuition fees and personal expenses. The best place for most of them is the service industry that can transfer skills quickly.
- l Headhunting from competition: The term headhunting refers to identifying specific talent and approaching them for employment. An alert recruiter keeps an eye out for good talent in other organisations. He would approach them discreetly and offer them to join their own organisation on a competing salary. Head hunting is also done by agencies to maintain confidentiality and avoid ill will with competitors.
- l Job Advertisements: These are the job announcements in the media. These appear most often in the newspapers, trade magazines or appropriate media. This is an expensive proposition as media space is costly, but has the advantage of directly receiving applicants without having to pay a fee to a recruiting agency. Job advertisements are preferred when the candidates are to be recruited in a volume. Small restaurants may post a vacancy on their shop window to attract job seekers passing by.
- l Professional journals: This is the most appropriate medium to reach the right target market for talent. Trade journals are read by professionals of the trade and serve as an active place for job seekers and job recruiters.
- l Job Fairs: This is a relatively new concept bringing together recruiters to put up stalls either in a college campus or a common ground. Job seekers can contact several recruiters under one roof. The benefit of such fairs is that these fairs attract potential talent at one place.

## Non-traditional Sources

There are situations when hotels, especially in small towns and resorts may not have access to traditional sources of human resource supply, as mentioned above. In such cases, there are other sources, which can be considered and developed:

- l Part-timers: Are a floating workforce who are called to work at peak operational times. They are paid on an hourly basis. They could possibly be people doing a second job to earn extra money.
- l Housewives: Are a very good source to fill job vacancies. Often women are well-qualified but restricted in their career due to child rearing. Once children are old enough to go to school, these women can be available for jobs in the mornings once they have sent their children to school.
- l College students: These are a very big source of additional hands, as they either want to earn extra money, or want to get experience as in the case of hotel school students. They are paid on an hourly basis.
- l Handicapped people: This is a good source especially for back house jobs; for example a telephone operator, secretary, accounts clerk, etc. These people can be wheelchair bound but can do a good job in these positions.

<!-- image -->

Western nations are encouraging handicapped people to become part of the mainstream workforce. They provide special ramps for wheelchairs, lower door handles and elevator buttons, special toilet facilities etc. to make it easy for the handicapped to deal with every thing at their workplace. This movement will increase over the years as a measure for harnessing potential good talent.

- l Retired people: Organisations, due to dated policies, retire people especially when they are at the peak of their knowledge and experience.  With people working hard to keep fit, retired people are still productive during their middle ages. Many societies have extended the retirement age from 58 years to 65 years. Retired people can be excellent alternative sources when talent is scarce.
- l Management companies: The  new  age  has sprung  specialists  in  every  field.  It  becomes sometimes more economical to outsource some functions  like  the  human  resources,  accounting, legal, etc. to management companies who have larger  resources  and  technical  expertise  to  tap from.

## Recruitment and Selection

We need to make a differentiation between recruitment and selection. Recruitment is the process of getting human resources from the market for given vacant positions. Selection is the process of choosing from the eligible human resources identified. The term hiring is a composit of these two functions.

There are several components in the hiring process as illustrated in Fig. 3.6.

Fig. 3.6 The Hiring Process

<!-- image -->

Job Analysis, Job Descriptions, Job Specifications and Sourcing have been discussed earlier. Let us look at the other components of the hiring process. The sources of supply would have produced a number of respondents with Resumes, Bio-data or Curriculum Vitae (which mean the same).

Screening is the process of matching the candidates resume or curriculum vitae with the job specifications of the position. Fig. 3.7 below is self-explanatory.

Fig. 3.7 The Screening Process

<!-- image -->

Contact is getting in touch with selected candidates at the time, date and venue of the interview or test. Some establishments mention the name and/or the job title of the interviewer/s. Another important aspect of contact is with the rejected candidates. The common courtesy of an organisation is to inform the rejected candidates. This not only promotes the image of the establishment as professional, but also saves the establishment from having to attend to unnecessary phone calls from candidates who want to know the status of their applications.

Testing is a way to ensure that a candidate has the knowledge, skills and aptitudes for the job. There are various ways to test candidates:

- l Technical tests evaluate skills. A cook may be asked to prepare a four-course menu, a server to lay out a table cover, a room service order-taker to do a voice test, a secretary a typing test, or an experienced room attendant to prepare a room.
- l Group Discussions ascertain leadership and team qualities. Groups of no larger than fifteen candidates are given a topic to discuss. They are evaluated not only on the content of their contributions but also the way they relate to each other.
- l Extempore Speaking evaluates oral communication and stress. The stress is created by making the candidate pick a topic from a bowl and speak instantly. Topics can be deliberately vague to create the pressure. In stress situations, even a simple topic can be daunting.
- l Aptitude Tests assess verbal, numerate and conceptual abilities. An aptitude test can also test general knowledge.
- l Physical Aptitude Tests check out physical ability. A banquet server may be asked to carry a stack of twelve banquet chairs; kitchen stewards to carry a gas cylinder over his shoulder or a busboy a tray of crockery.

<!-- image -->

- l Case Studies ascertain problem solving skills and attitude. A case study is a written account of a real life problem, which needs to be resolved. A group is given the case study to discuss and find solutions. This is often used in supervisory and management positions.

## 166

- l Psychological  tests are  being  emphasised  nowadays.  Tests  like  the  Myers  Briggs performance indicator, Firo B and PF 16 accurately profile the person in terms of his or her attitudes and personality. It tells whether a person is suitable for the industry and job. We must remember that skills can be developed but right attitudes are difficult to find.

Interviews are face-to-face interaction for the purpose of selection. It is a method of selection most commonly used. However few people are actually skilled at interviewing. The process is critical because it tells the candidate how professional the organisation is.

There are many types of interviews:

- l Directed or structured interviews elicit  specific  information.  The  questions  are  so framed to solicit an answer which is either a Yes or No, or a monosyllabic answer. This method is used to ascertain facts. An example is, Are you presently employed? The answer can only be Yes or No.
- l Undirected or unstructured interviews ask open-ended questions to get a person to talk more. Open-ended questions start with What, Where, When, Which, Why and How. An example is What are your duties and responsibilities? The candidate is obliged to give an expanded explanation.
- l Board Interviews are often final interviews with senior authorities of selection. However, these can also be earlier interviews with a panel of interviewers involved in the selection process. A hotel may involve the Accommodations Manager, Human Resources Manager and  the  Executive  Housekeeper  when  selecting  a  housekeeping  professional.  These interviewers are necessary to ask technical questions, motivational questions etc. to arrive at a decision.
- l Stress interviews check a persons reaction under stress. The service industry is known to have stress in dealing with different people with various needs. Recruiters may want to see a candidate under a stress situation by creating one. They have done this with the help of  trained  psychologists.  However,  there  are  moral  issues  involved  in  conducting  these interviews and so they have been abandoned.
- l Group interviews are done when there is a large number of applicants and selection is to be made in a short period of time for few vacancies. The groups are assembled and quizzed verbally.

## Basic Interviewing Skills

Interviews are a meeting of two interested parties. It is unfortunate that both interviewers and interviewees fear these meetings, when in fact it can be a wonderful dialogue. There are both advantages and disadvantages of interviews:

## Advantages:

- 1. It provides an opportunity for a face-to-face meeting.
- 2. Both the candidate and the interviewer can clarify doubts of mutual interest.
- 3. Both can get first hand information.
- 4. Provides an opportunity for negotiation.

## Disadvantages:

- 1. It is time consuming.
- 2. Not everyone is skilled in conducting an interview but they do so.

<!-- image -->

- 3. There is a stress on the candidate for selection.
- 4. The issue of salary is an embarrassing point for both the candidate and the interviewer.

There are a few tips for the Executive Housekeeper to make interviews pleasurable.

## Preparation

Preparing for an interview is vital to make the time spent worthwhile. Preparation includes:

- l Matching the candidates resume with the job specification. This would have already been done at the screening stage. Resumes do not give all the information and the interviewer would like to make a list of questions and clarifications.
- l Questions must be unique to the individual. Many interviewers ask standard questions which candidates get used to and are prepared with brilliant replies.
- l Selecting an interview room free from distraction. Such a room must not have a telephone connection to disturb the interviewer. The room should be ambient and equipped with drinking water. It is recommended not to provide tea or coffee service because that may distract the conversation.
- l Candidates who come from other organisations may not like to enter a competing hotels premises. Interviews may be held at neutral places like a coffee shop or a business centre.
- l It is not recommended to keep a table between candidates and the interviewer. This shows power and candidates get intimidated with it.
- l Keep Interview Rating Sheets available to record interview comments.

## Putting the Candidate at Ease

- l An interviewers objective is to get honest and accurate replies. Often interviewers put the candidate against the wall, which gets them the distored answers instead of the best ones from the candidates.
- l It is important to be on time. Candidates too have their schedules in a day and would like the interview to begin on time. It shows that the organisation is professional by valuing the candidates time.
- l The interviewer must go to where the candidate is seated and receive him or her by a formal greeting. Often it is the receptionist or secretary who formally greets and leads them to the interviewers room.

<!-- image -->

- l It is important to put the candidate at ease by small talk. Perhaps a chat on the hobbies and pastimes of the candidate, or a special event in town etc; If nothing elsethe weather!
- l Once the candidate is at ease, it is important to establish the purpose and format of the interview.

## Interview Techniques

- l Let the candidate do most of the talking. The ideal distribution of discussion should be 80% of it should be done by the candidate and 20% by the interviewer.
- l Use open-ended questions which start with What, Where, When, Which, Why and How. This lets the candidate to give larger explanations.
- l Use close-ended questions to ascertain facts.
- l When a question is asked give time to the candidate to compose his or her thoughts. The silence is a tactic to get the person to speak.
- l Use body language to full advantage. Use eye contact to show interest; smile to defuse the stress of the situation; nodding to establish comprehension of what the candidate is saying. These are all silent strategies for the best effect.
- l Never write on application forms as there could be legal implications.
- l Questions should not be discriminatory. Discrimination questions relate to caste, religion, sex, age, region, colour, etc. Stick to the job only. Some states by the enactment of law may have job quotas for minorities, women, handicapped, war veterans, etc. This should be ascertained at the screening stage and not in the interview.

## Closing the Interview

- l Invite questions and clarifications from the candidate.
- l Tell about the benefits of joining the organisationits management, career plans, training, employee benefits, etc.
- l Give details of the job position including working hours.
- l Discuss salary expectations.
- l Some organisations may like to tell a candidate why he or she is not suitable at the end of the interview. Most like to make a selection after interviewing other candidates. In each case, it is important to tell the candidate when to expect a reply. A reply must be sent.
- l Thank the employee for his or her time and escort the candidate to the door. This is a common courtesy that gives the candidate selfrespect.

## Joining Formalities

Offer letters show the interest of an organisation to provide employment to a candidate in writing. The following are the basic issues that offer letters must mention. Additional information may be added based on the policy of the establishment.

- l The Job Title: This is important to confirm the job position being offered. There is a distinction between a job title and designation. The job title is the term used for a position best accepted and understood by the public. Considerable effort is being made to create innovative titles to give employees self-respect in society. A room attendant can be called a

Floor Hostess, etc. A designation is the root role against which salaries and benefits are given. In the given example the designation is the Room Attendant.

- l Reporting relationships: These are the immediate boss and the bosss superior. This establishes whom the jobholder has to get decisions and directions from and in his absence, the next senior person to whom he should report.
- l Date of Joining: This defines when the hired person is expected to commence work. The date of joining establishes the date from which salaries and benefits are applicable and the incumbent can be scheduled into the work force.
- l Salary &amp; Benefits: This is key information on which the candidate makes a decision whether to join or not. Salaries are the basic components of pay to cover basic needs of an individual. These may be in the form of basic pay, house rent allowance, transportation allowance and position allowance. Benefits are those additional facilities provided to an individual to attract the best people in the job market. Benefits are sometimes statutory like gratuity, leave and leave pay, pension deductions, medical benefits, etc. while other benefits may be  company  specific  offerings  such  as  leave  fares,  free  duty  meals,  company accommodation, education allowance, domestic help allowance, etc. Organisations have moved away from break up of remuneration and prefer to give lump-sum remunerations to permit the individual the freedom to use the money as he or she pleases.
- l Probationary period: It is necessary to give all new recruits a trial period in which the organisation and the individual can decide whether to make the employment permanent or not. Probationary periods can range from three months for junior positions to one year for senior management positions.

Reference Checks are  done  to  ascertain  the  candidates  work  proficiency,  character  and teamwork from past associates. There are two types of reference checks:

- l Candidate references given by the candidate from the school/college, prominent people and previous employers.
- l Independent references are made directly by the establishment with previous employers, police, previous bosses and social clubs.

Then there are two more purposes of references:

- l Character certificates show the character traits of a candidate.  Organisations prefer such certificates  from valued people in society, including school and college principals, responsible people known to the candidate, etc.
- l Work references are given by previous employers to confirm the period a person has worked in the organisation, the role he or she performed and his efficiency at work.

The Appointment Letter is the final contract between an organisation and the candidate.

The issues mentioned in an appointment letter are:

- l Job Title
- l Reporting relationship
- l Joining date
- l Salary &amp; benefits
- l Probationary period

<!-- image -->

## 170

The above are the same as mentioned in offer letters. However, there are more clauses added in an appointment letter.

- l Notice periods establish the time period required for the severance of service between the  organisation and individual. During the probationary period, the notice is normally twenty-four hours, while during confirmed service the notice can be from one to three months based on how critical the position is.
- l Legal provisions are  those that are required by the law like not indulging in criminal activities, being intoxicated at work, getting involved in malpractices, etc.
- l Confidentiality clauses are added by organisations to prevent company information and secrets being leaked out to competitors.
- l Job Description of the candidates position is enclosed to have a common perception of what is expected from him or her.

There are processes to formally register the candidate into the organisation. Some of the formalities are dictated by law, such as salary and employment contracts, while others are dictated by policies of the organisation.

Joining formalities include:

- l Copies of original certificates: Organisations insist on this to confirm that a candidate is qualified for the post. Certificates often asked for are the birth certificate, school leaving certificate, college certificates, employment certificates and training certificates.
- l A medical check: This is mandatory by many organisations to ensure  that  a  candidate  is  physically  fit  to  do  the  job.  It  also establishes whether the candidate has any communicable diseases like  aids,  tuberculosis,  open  sores  etc.  This  becomes  critical especially when dealing with guests.

<!-- image -->

- l Formal application form: Most establishments prescribe their own application form for the candidate to fill though they may have received the candidates curriculum vitae/resume. This is to ensure that the information that the establishment values is consistent for all employees. For example, an application form may insist on an emergency telephone number in the event of a crisis concering the candidate when he is at work. Establishments may want to know the blood group of the candidate in case of an accident at work that requires immediate hospitalisation.
- l Copies of References: We had seen earlier the importance of reference letters. These references are kept in file as a record of authenticity of the reference.
- l Induction/Orientation: Progressive organisations will have an orientation programme to familiarise a new candidate to the organisation in order to make the candidate productive at the shortest period of time. The orientation includes the organisations products and services, history, whos who, organisation structure, dos and donts, company policies, etc.
- l Issue of an identity card: Most organisations would like their employees to carry an identity card to confirm their employment with the organisation. This identity card is useful in case of accidents on the road or as identification for entry into the premises. Organisations also  prescribe  staff  numbers  for  accounting  purposes  and  the  payment  of  salaries  and wages.

<!-- image -->

- l Information to accounts for the payment of salary: This is a joining formality to inform the accounts department so that they can open a salary account for the new candidate. The accounts may want bank account details to deposit salaries directly into the candidates account.

## 3.3 ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES

## Taking Attendance

Attendance must be taken in every shift as it impacts on the salaries and wages of the service staff. Some servers are paid wages by the hour while others may be paid a monthly salary. The amount of salary is related to attendance or the persons presence at work converted to their contribution to the operation.

The Executive Housekeeper must maintain three attendance registers:

- (a) One which has all the names of housekeeping personnel listed on a page to mark their presence or absence.
- (b) One which devotes a page to each housekeeping member that records the number of hours each has worked, along with their days off, overtime statistics and special duties.
- (c) One register that records the hours put in by daily wagers or employees working on an hourly basis.

Modern technology has introduced the time card system that does away with tedious registers. The moment an employ is hired, the Human Resources department issues a time card that is maintained at the time office located at the employee entrance at the back of the hotel. This is a single door through which all employees enter and exit the building. The time office (as the name suggests) is where employees register their time in and time out. The time office is manned 24 hours of the day by timekeepers in three shifts. The system consists of specially designed cards that have columns for the dates, time-in and time-out, and are maintained in racks at the time office. The time-keeper punches the time through a time punch machine each time an employee enters or exits the hotel. This is a fool proof method as machines do not lie. Modern technology has introduced electronic time punch machines that send the data directly to terminals in the Accounts, Human Resources and the Housekeeping Control Desk. Each can monitor when an employee has clocked in and out.

The registers or time cards are legal documents maintained as per labor laws and are carefully controlled. While registers are used for a year, time cards are issued each month. The payroll section, located either in the Human Resources Department or the Accounts Department, as per policy, calculates the salaries and wages at the end of each month. Some establishments may pay salaries every fortnight to help their employees maintain their personal cash flows. Salary payment schedules are also determined by the labour law. The Executive Housekeeper must ensure some norms while maintaining the attendance of staff:

- l Staff coming late must be marked late because late-coming is a taboo in the service industry. Service is provided by warm bodies and late-coming can seriously jeopardise the quality of service. The Human Resources Department can force legal penalties on the staff through wage deductions to emphasise the importance of attendance.
- l The Executive Housekeeper must mark the attendance with a pen to prevent any malpractice. Any additions or deletions must be counter-signed by the Executive Housekeeper and the employee in acknowledgement of amendments.

<!-- image -->

- l The Executive Housekeeper must counsel habitual late-comers and absentees before taking action. Late-coming and absenteeism are punishable offences and can even lead to dismissal of the employee.
- l The Executive Housekeeper and Supervisors must always emphasize the importance of attendance in all briefings.

## Briefing

Briefing is that process at the beginning of a work shift which is provided by the management to facilitate a two-way communication between management and staff. It is the one time during a shift that all housekeeping staff are together to share information and feelings before they disperse to their work areas. Briefing is normally undertaken when all the housekeeping personnel report on duty at the beginning of the shift to receive their work allotments for the day. This is after the employees have formally clocked into the hotel at the office time and have collected their fresh uniforms which they change in the locker rooms, provided separately for men and women. All employees are required to report for briefing, properly attired and at the scheduled commencement of the shift or preferably earlier.

In the housekeeping department, briefing is conducted at the Housekeeping Control Desk room. Ideally, the Executive Housekeeper must conduct the briefing. However, if busy, she may delegate this responsibility to the Assistant Housekeeper. Given below are the issues covered in a briefing that takes about fifteen minutes:

## Dress Turnout

Housekeeping staff are mostly in the public eye. It is, therefore, important that they are well groomed and hygienically clean. While grooming projects the image and quality of the hotel, a guest also likes to feel that the people who clean their rooms are themselves very hygienic. The housekeeper, therefore, checks the following:

- 1. Personal hygienefingernails are cut short, housemen are shaven and there should be no body odour. Body odour is a hazard in hot climates and staff is encouraged to used deodorants and light colognes.
- 2. Hair should be clean and neatly combed/arranged. Hairnets are suggested but not essential.
- 3. Little or no make-up for the ladies.
- 4. Staff must not wear jewelry except for the wedding ring or unobtrusive earrings.
- 5. Uniforms must be clean and well-pressed. They must be of proper size and well-fastened.
- 6. Stockings must be clean and of permitted colours of the establishment. Stockings must not have runs or holes.
- 7. Shoes must be the prescribed  wear  of  the  establishment  that  have  low  heels  and  well polished.

## Allotment of Duties

At a briefing, the duties of each staff member and the areas of accountability are explained. Some hotels believe in a rotational policy of assigning rooms to make room attendants and housemen

<!-- image -->

familiar with all the floors and rooms of the hotel. Others may assign dedicated floors and room numbers on the belief that this brings about ownership to those set of rooms and the staff are fiercely proud about the standards maintained in their charge. They are also informed about the supervisor assigned to the floor. The public area supervisor too receives her special instructions about public areas that will need more attention in a given day. Her duties would also include periodic  preventive  maintenance schedules like chandelier cleaning, carpet shampooing, wall cleaning etc.

## Policies and Procedures

The briefing is the opportunity for re-emphasising existing policies and procedures of the property especially those that impact on housekeeping staff. It is the time to introduce new policies and receive queries and clarifications about them.

## VIPs in the House

The housekeeper must give the names and room numbers of VIPs in the house. Each room attendant will check those numbers against the rooms allotted to her in the shift. VIP rooms will receive special attention in their preparation. The VIP list is further displayed on the communications notice board of the desk control room.

## Feedback from Staff

Briefing  time  is  the  best  opportunity  to  receive  professional  grievances  that  impact  on  the productivity of the staff. (Personal grievances are handled in privacy on a one-to-one basis and not in a public forum like a briefing). It is beneficial to productivity and morale if grievances are resolved immediately and not allowed to fester. Feedback also takes another dimension in the quest for continuous improvement. Ideas for improvement are encouraged by progressive hotels from those at the operational end as they know best how a guest experience can be enhanced.

## Training

Briefing is the time to coach staff in minor tasks. Larger tasks will need more time and attention. One of the reminders in training is the standards of performance. Standards such as the number of  rooms  to  be  completed  in  a  shift;  cleaning  standards;  etc.  are  reemphasized  daily.  The Housekeeper gives feedback of supervisor reports on standards and ascertains those that need training and those that need disciplinary action.

## Recognition and Praise

Since all housekeeping staff, on a given shift, assembles at a briefing, it is the good opportunity to praise those who have given good work. It is taught in good management to praise in public and discipline in private.

## Guest Complaints

In spite of the best intentions of the hotel, guest complaints continue to come as each guest perceives service in his own special way. Such complaints can be logged by the guest to the (a) Control Desk Supervisor, (b) Guest Relations Executive, (c) Lobby Manager, (d) Guest Comment Forms, (e) General Manager, (f) Floor Supervisor and (g) Room Attendant. Such complaints must

## 176

be looked upon as a gift by the guest to improve services. A guest who does not voice his or her complaint is dangerous because s/he would not come again and definitely speak about the bad experience to others. To protect the hotel from further recurrence of bad service, it is best to tackle the complaints immediately and encourage suggestions from the housekeeping staff to get their ownership of the complaint and rectify the same.

## Other Information

It is important to give information of a general nature. The housekeeping staff must be integrated with the rest of the hotel so that they see the larger picture of operations rather than being cocooned in their own small world. Some additional information that should be shared is:

- 1. Performance of the hotel
- 2. New projects and developments
- 3. New policies and practices
- 4. Functions in the house
- 5. New management and staff joined in other departments
- 6. Inspections by government authorities in the house
- 7. Special food promotions in restaurants
- 8. Groups and crews expected
- 9. Special requests by guests regarding amenities in the room
- 10. Assignment of baby sitting services.

## Managing Discipline

Discipline is the hallmark of a good hotelier. Discipline is required for many reasons: (a) Guests like to see a professional outfit doing their duties with clockwork precision; (b) indiscipline reflects on the image of the property, which can be ruined through the word of mouth; (c) a lack of

discipline severely affects the final quality of service. Imagine a room attendant who forgets to log a request for baby sitting services by a guest or when a room attendant forgets to leave water tumblers in the room; (d) It reflects on the hygiene and sanitation standards of the property if employees are not well-groomed and hygienically unclean. Imagine room attendants with soiled uniforms? (e) There is discipline in the way employees communicate with guests. A lack of courtesy, etiquettes and manners can spoil the entire experience for a guest; (f) Displine involves following systems and procedures to avoid chaos during busy operations. Shortcuts to service invariably affect standards; (g) Displine entails coordination with other departments and fellowmembers to get their cooperation. If the kitchen decides to slow down

<!-- image -->

its service, the restaurant brigade will be faced with the wrath of the guests as they are in the front line; (h) discipline is required the punctuality and attendance of the staff. If there are no warm bodies the restaurant cannot give the desired standards of service.

Indiscipline happens for several reasons. The table below gives the reasons for indiscipline and how they can be addresses by the Executive Housekeeper:

| Reasons for Indiscipline   | Course of action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unavoidable circumstances  | Pressing domestic situations like family sickness, parent-teacher meetings, etc cannot be avoided. This should be excused provided the employee has excused himself or herself before the operation starts. Any proof like  a  medical  certificate  authenticates  an  absence,  however,  the housekeepr is guided by the track record of the employee. |
| Adventurism                | Young employees are hot-blooded and like to beat the system. Dont kill adventurism because it can be converted to enthusiasm. Give such staff challenging tasks and additional responsibilities that will occupy their                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Lack of control systems    | time and need for adventure. Many acts may seem as indiscipline but actually they are caused by a lack of system and procedures. A housekeeper must seal loopholes in the system. A written code of conduct is also necessary to let employees know the rules. The housekeeper can seek the assistance of the Human                                       |
| Ignorance of rules         | Ignorance of rules is a crime and therefore, employees can be penalised for  this.  However,  the  Housekeeper  must  re-emphasize  rules  during briefings to keep such things on the top of the mind of an employee                                                                                                                                     |
| To attract attention       | daily. The industrial age has brought isolation and anonymity when huge work forces are employed. It is easy to be ignored and lonely. Many people deliberately cause indiscipline to attract the attention of the supervisors. A Housekeeper, in the first instance must know and dialogue with his/                                                     |
| Does not accept the system | ingredient of leadership. The housekeeper should counsel the employee and make him/her realise the importance of the system and how it fits into the larger scheme of                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Rebelliousness             | things. Rebellious people are so because of perceived injustice. The Housekeeper can sit with the rebel and understand the injustice meted out to him/ her. Well-defined grievance procedures have helped in avoiding rebellious situations. More important is that the Housekeeper must be fair and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Affiliation with           | The Housekeeper should identify these negative groups and their leader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| negative groups            | S/he should try to understand the reasons behind negative behaviour. Win over the group leader by giving him/her importance and a say in proceedings.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bad habits                 | Re-enforce good habits during training sessions and briefings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Short-cutting systems      | Penalise the employee after giving two warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Wilful motives             | People with wilful motives are dangerous. If counseling has failed, then dismiss the person from the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

While the above are some reasons for indiscipline and how to deal with them, the following are some general guidelines to maintain a disciplined team:

- 1. Ensure that there are written house rules and code of conduct. These must be distributed to each employee and re-enforced at briefings.

## 178

- 2. Motivate staff to follow rules and maintain discipline and how it can benefit them in terms of advancement, better tips and cooperation from team members.
- 3. A fault committed must be checked at once.
- 4. Always discipline in private.
- 5. Set an example by being self-disciplined. Staff must see their housekeeper or supervisor as the role model.
- 6. Check the Labour laws regarding disciplinary proceedings. Normally two warnings are given in writing before formal charges can be made.
- 7. Take the help of the Human Resources Department who are trained and qualified to handle disciplinary proceedings within the law.

## Cost Control

A measure of increasing the profits of a housekeeping operation is by reducing costs. While this is the responsibility of the entire brigade, the accountability for cost control lies with the Executive Housekeeper. Here are some tips to reduce costs:

- 1. Check that quantity standards are strictly maintained. The guest amenities in a room must number those that are prescribed. The amount of detergents used must be in the correct quantities.
- 2. Staff must be trained to handle equipment correctly. Proper usage gives equipment a longer life.
- 3. Linen is expensive and constitutes a major investment by the owner. It should not be used for wiping tables or floors. Dusters are of cheaper material and used for cleaning purposes.
- 4. Expensive stationery must not be used as rough pads for dawdling.
- 5. Employees must be trained to meet productivity standards. Labour costs consume a large portion of the budget.
- 6. Inspections are important to ensure that correct procedures are followed.
- 7. Staff scheduling must ensure that there is the best utilisation of human resources on any given day.
- 8. Send timely maintenance orders to the maintenance staff. Items fixed on time will avoid higher costs when bigger breakdowns take place.
- 9. Recycle re-usable items like flower arrangements, soaps, discarded linen, newspapers, bottles and cans.
- 10. The staff must be trained to complete their tasks correctly the first time round. Repeating a task takes valuable human resource time.
- 11. Florists must raise checks for flower arrangements ordered by the guests. Similarly babysitting services, special laundry charges must be meticulously accounted for.
- 12. The Housekeeper must be hawk-eyed for pilferage by staff.
- 13. Ensure the daily cleaning of the premises to keep assets fresh.
- 14. Ensure that the staff strength is optimum to meet business demands. Excess staff is a cost.

## Employee Scheduling

The scheduling  of  employees  of  a  housekeeping  department  is  very demanding and critical  as  it  has  a  large  workforce  and  the  greatest proportion of employee hours to cover. Moreover unlike the restaurant and  bar,  which  generate  revenues  that  cover  employee  costs, housekeeping  is  a  cost  centre.  Revenue  centres  can  afford  to  add employees as the potential for revenue increases. Housekeeping does not have this flexibility. Each employee added has to meticulously justify the cost of such addition. The housekeeping department is very visible to customers and any deficiency in standards of housekeeping is immediately noticed. The Executive Housekeeper is challenged to ensure the right

<!-- image -->

mix of employees that uphold the tasks of keeping a clean house to the highest standards.

The Housekeeping Department can have an elaborate employee structure depending on the size of hotel. The Housekeeping Department has many positions like the housekeeper and assistant housekeepers, room attendants, housemen, cleaners for employees locker rooms, cloakroom attendants, valets, uniform and linen keeper, etc. The employee hours depend on the hotel and type of customer, business people require different time schedules than people on holiday with children. The employee needs to be scheduled accordingly and in a ratio to the number of guests staying in the hotel. Fortunately, most people book ahead and the workload is known well in advance, especially during peak periods.

The scheduling of employees ensures that the demands during the business hours are met. The schedule must show a human face in taking into account each employees special requests for leave as far as possible without affecting service. Employees must be rotated equitably through shifts and holidays. Hotel business is a 7-day business and not all employees can get leave on the same day. Guests stay  in  the  hotel  even  on  weekends  and  national  holidays.  Housekeeping employees have to be on duty to give the guests their service. The off-days have to be distributed fairly on a round-robin basis as given in the schedule below. The schedule must be made at least three  or  four  days  before  it  becomes  effective  to  enable  employees  to  plan  their  personal commitments to meet their duty hours. Every schedule is authorized by the Executive Housekeeper who is responsible for the human resources and their deployment. The schedule must ensure optimal deployment to ensure that peak hours are fully serviced with competent employees. Busy hotels like downtown hotels, business hotels or airport hotels run a 24 ¥ 7 operation have morning, afternoon, and night shifts. The simplest way to schedule employees is given on next page.

One observes that each employee gets a day off in the week. A relievers position is created to substitute the employee on leave on a particular day.

## Considerations while Scheduling

However, employees scheduling may not be as simple when it comes to large busy hotels. Employee requirements will depend on the occupancy of  the  hotel.  The  numbers  change  appreciably during  peak  season  and  off  season.  The  challenge  to  a  housekeeper  is  whether  to  man housekeeping at 100% occupancy and carry the cost over low occupancy periods or man the housekeeping to the yearly average occupancy and manage peak periods with part-timers during full occupancy. While this may appear the best solution, the Executive Housekeeper is faced with

other  challenges  such  as  the  ready  availability  of  part-timers  when  needed;  the  standards  of productivity and quality provided by part-timers; the higher costs of wages in season; the time required to train them before they are made operational; whether part-timers can be relied upon or not to reveal confidential information to competitors; and whether they can readily become part of the housekeeping team.

Scheduling takes into account productivity standards . It is possible to get quite good estimates of employee numbers based on average times to do tasks, such as cleaning a room. Then we can allocate 10, or 15, or even 20 rooms to each room attendant based on how busy the hotel is. A standard practice is to allot 16 rooms to a room attendant. It is quite easy to estimate the total number of employees needed in a year by dividing the total man hours required by the productivity standard. For example, cleaning an occupied room takes 30mins, en-suite bathroom 6mins and then 4 minutes are taken for loading carts and tea breaks, all this amounts to 40 minutes for every departure room. Then in an eight hour of 480 minutes, a room attendant can complete 12 occupied rooms. A hotel with 100 rooms (all occupied) needs 8 room attendants per shift. Then we can sum this up for a year of 365 days, which comes to 2900 room attendant days per year. We can then divide this by the number of days a room attendant works per year, say 240, and arrive at a figure of 12 full time room attendants. Hence we can recruit 12 room attendants and start using them on the rooms. This hasnt taken into account the average occupancy, sickness rates, and a lot of other things which readily come to mind, because at this point, the difficult thing is to find a way of sharing the yearly workload on a day by day basis. This is the difficult part, just how to allocate the room attendants so that there are just the right number on every day.

A lot also depends on where the hotel is at the moment. Scheduling for an existing hotel is different to a new hotel. While existing hotels have past records to rely on, new hotels will have to depend on data such as average occupancy expected, mix of guests, e.g. individuals or families etc. from competing hotels or published materials.

Innovative software is  available  in  the  market  like  Visual  Rota  which  can  plan  the  entire complexities involved in a moment. However, such software does require realistic input. Software for new hotels will start with the daily hour totals to tell how many employees are needed each day. If this is fed into the software, it will calculate a schedule for a 13-14 week period by naming non-existent  employees,  as  RM1,  RM2,  etc.  It  will  allocate  shifts  according  to  the  expected occupancy anticipated. One can factor in full-time or part-time employees, working full shifts, half shifts and split shifts. It calculates the employee days off, usually in the ratio of 1 day for every 6 days. In view of the critical nature of housekeeping operations, it is advisable to use full-time employees as much as possible if they are cheaper, and fill in odd days in the calculations with parttime employees. The Executive Housekeeper can recruit the employees in accordance with her requirements and allocate shifts to the employees weeks in advance, possibly months.

At some stage the Executive Housekeeper will need to deal with holidays and  employee turnover. All employees take annual holidays but it is difficult to know in advance when this is going to be. Therefore, the Executive Housekeeper must take out an Annual Leave Plan at the beginning of the year and fill in employee requests for leave. Employees, in other words, have to plan in advance their leave in conjunction with work requirements. Employees are required to give their first and second choices of leave dates. The housekeeper normally will grant first choice of annual leave dates. However, if there is a clash of dates with others, she will opt for the second choice. Busy hotels may require a third choice as well. The advantage of advance planning is that both  the  Executive  Housekeeper  and  the  employee  are  synchronized  in  leave  dates.  The housekeeper also knows the dates when to make alternative arrangements.

As regards staff turnover ,  the  Executive Housekeeper has to depend on past records of turnover and use it as a guideline. New hotels may have a problem and one can only make a guess. Past records provided by the Human Resource Department of existing hotels will also show the pattern of absenteeism, sickness and holidays. This pattern can be fed into scheduling software which makes some predictions. It makes a lot of sense for an Executive Housekeeper to budget scheduling software into the housekeeping capital budget. The housekeepers budget can then include hiring costs and recruitment plans.

Scheduling also has to factor in training days of employees in addition to sickness, absenteeism, lateness, frequency of requests and holidays.

Scheduling can be improved by improvements in work practices . Scheduling software can help existing hotels to analyse work practices and recommend improvements.  Savings made on improvements in work practices can be routed as incentives to employees to increase motivation and reduce turnover.

Schedules must move employees around to minimize the effects of peaks and troughs in occupancy levels. The housekeeper can bring in more employees when needed and give them days off during slack periods. A good work schedule keeps track of employee hours and shifts, so that everyone gets exactly the right number of hours to work at the least cost for the hotel.

There is always a compromise between the number of employees doing a particular job and the cover they provide. If there is only one housekeeper, then the maximum cover would be 48

## 182

hours/week, whilst the employee Rota would require up to 168 hours of cover a week. The challenge is to determine the amount of cover required at different job levels and what can be sacrificed without affecting operations.

The assignment of duties must be fair and equitable. No employee must be over burdened to an extent that his or her productivity is affected. It is also important for the employees to be free from monotony. The common tasks for all employees are to serve guests. However, there are tasks that can be rotated among the housekeeping employees. These tasks are:

- 1. Polishing brassware
- 2. Exchanging linen
- 3. Collecting supplies from stores
- 4. Preparing the Housekeeping Report
- 5. Checking fire prevention systems
- 6. Providing babysitting services (after work hours)
- 7. Manning the control desk
- 8. Cleaning the floor pantry

These  tasks  must  be  distributed  equitably  among  the  employees  as  they  are  routine  and sometimes tedious. However, they provide the team with opportunities to learn additional tasks. The Executive Housekeeper must also ensure the rotation of employees on different floors and public areas. She must also ensure that each floor or public area has equal employee strength i.e. one room attendant to sixteen rooms or one houseman to 2500 square feet. Equity boosts morale.

## 3.4 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION

## Types of Communication

The Executive Housekeepers responsibilities will include a certain degree of correspondence and formal oral communication. While we have discussed interpersonal communication in Introduction, this section explains the basic principles of written and oral communication that are specific to the housekeeper, led by slides developed by the author for lectures to those entering the professional world.

## Types of Written and Oral Communication

| Written                         | Oral                     |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| l Informal notes                | l Unplanned encounters   |
| l Memorandum                    | l Meetings               |
| l Letters                       | l Job interview          |
| l Forms and Formats             | l Appraisal interview    |
| l Reports                       | l Disciplinary interview |
| l Training &amp; Procedural Manuals | l Persuasive interview   |
| l Notices                       | l Telephone calls        |
| l Documents                     | l Briefings              |

## Written Communication

The Executive Housekeeper is involved with a large degree of written communication as part of her responsibilities. She represents the department internally and externally on various occasions and therefore, must know how to use the different modes given above correctly. A professional will adopt written communication as listed above for several reasons:

- 1. It acts as a permanent record that can be filed for future reference if required. Some records like reports are needed for managerial decisions while letters and memos act as proofs that the communication has been made.
- 2. Written communication can be planned and composed to express exactly what is meant to be said without the handicaps that oral communication sometimes lapses into.
- 3. It cloaks feelings that oral communication cannot hide, unless the communicator wants to express feelings. It can be objective.
- 4. Written communication avoids time consuming meetings and can cut distances as when letters are sent.

There are disadvantages however:

- 1. It lacks the personal touch that a face-to-face meeting can provide.
- 2. The written word can be misinterpreted if the right words and language is not used.
- 3. There is a lack of immediate feedback that a face-to-face meeting gives.
- 4. A written communication sent has a permanency and cannot be retracted.

## 184

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

In spite of the disadvantages written communication is preferred in many circumstances:

- l To summarise key issues
- l Invite a response
- l Respond to other written communication.
- l Be formal
- l Keep records
- l Provide source of historical data
- l Express corporate strategy &amp; ideology
- l Lend credibility to utterances
- l Establish importance of communication
- l Access a wider audience
- l Be accurate in information
- l Share goals, visions, understanding
- l Present data independently

With this background we can examine the different formal written correspondence that takes place in a professional executive housekeepers working life.

Informal notes are useful to send immediate messages. Being informal, the note can be torn and disposed with the result that there is no record. The housekeeper leaves informal notes as she is busy and does not want to forget an instruction that she intends to give. It is a good practice for a professional to note down ideas that flash through mind or to take action when a telephone call is made. For example, a housekeeper may receive a request for baby-sitting services from a guest on phone. Before she proceeds on to her next task she will like to note the request and hand it over to the Control Desk. It is a good practice for professionals to keep a jotter pad in the pocket to note down thoughts in the course of their busy schedules.

Memorandums are very important written communications in any organisation. Memos are written for internal communication and replaces tedious letters. Memos are accepted as formal communication and have all the advantages and disadvantages of written communication. The diagram below gives the format of a typical memorandum. It simply states on the top of the memo to whom the memo is addressed; from who it is being sent; the date of the communication; and the subject of the communication. This format is used worldwide with perhaps minor variations.

## LESSON  3 Duties of an Executive Housekeeper

| Memorandum   | Memorandum   |
|--------------|--------------|
| o To:        |              |
| o From:      |              |
| o Date:      |              |
| o Subject    |              |

Letters are formal written communication normally sent to external parties. They have to follow certain norms that are universally understood. There are various types of letters in professional correspondence:

- l Confirmation Letters
- l Letters of acknowledgement
- l Letters of enquiry
- l Collection Letters
- l Letters of apology
- l Standard Letters
- l Circular Letters
- l Complaint Letters
- l Handwritten Letters

Whatever the type of letter they have to follow a standard format which reads as:

<!-- image -->

## 186

The assumption in the above format is that the housekeeper, as per the normal practice, sends the letter on the hotel letter-head which gives the name of the property on top and the address at the bottom of the paper with telephone numbers and fax numbers. Should there not be a letter head the format would alter to that given below. The addition is the senders name and address; the company telephone number and fax (e-mail may be added).

The sender mentions her name at the top while just her designation at the bottom. It is often debated what to call the receiver. It is quite simple:

- (a) If the receivers name is not known, address as:

Dear Sir/Madam

- (b) If the receiver is senior to the sender, address as:

Dear Mr. Smith

- (c) If the receiver is a lady and married, call her:

Dear Mrs. Smith

- (d) If the receiver is a lady and single, call her:

Dear Ms. Smith

- (e) If the receiver is a person who is well-known, call him:

Dear Jeremy

Forms and Formats: Forms are specific documents that drive action, while formats are layouts of these documents in a manner that is practical and understandable. The housekeeper may be involved in developing the forms and their formats. Housekeeping systems and procedures are driven by forms and formats. We will see in succeeding chapters the number of forms and formats

used. These are used to record types of information required for specific purposes. For example, Linen Exchange Control Sheet is a form to record the exact number and type of soiled linen handed over in exchange for fresh ones. Unless this information is provided the exchange cannot take place. These documents are control mechanisms and need to be filled correctly. Some forms like the Lost and Found Slip act as permanent records for use at a later date  as when guests claim the lost article after several months. To fill these forms and formats requires training into the use of them and they are an integral part of procedures. A housekeeper must insist that correct  forms  and  formats  are  used;  otherwise  information  can  be  inaccurate  and  not understandable.

## Forms &amp; Formats

| l Gets exact information required                   | l Some find it difficult to complete and will need   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| l Multiple usage                                    | training                                             |
| l Can be analysed                                   | l Design is important to get exact information       |
| l Easy information                                  | l Discomfort with some information asked for if      |
| l Used for decision-making                          | procedures are not followed                          |
| l Everyone has a common understanding of procedures |                                                      |

Reports constitute an important part of housekeeping operations. Reports are studied documents of proposals or action taken. It is amazing to know the number of reports that housekeepers have to generate:

- 1. The housekeeping report for the Front Office to confirm the occupancy status.
- 2. Inventory Reports of the status of linen and uniform inventories.
- 3. Budget reports for fund allocation prior to the budgeting year and review after the budgeting period.
- 4. Labour reports to local labour departments, especially when legislation requires quotas for different sections of society.
- 5. Occupational Hazard reports for the concerned authority in terms of methods and systems employed to prevent accidents.
- 6. Accident reports for the occupational hazard authority to analyse.
- 7. Equipment reports  following  the  life  of  different  equipment,  including  their  purchase, preventive maintenance schedules and breakdown records.
- 8. Performance appraisals of staff.

## Reports

| Advantages                | Disadvantages    |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| l Has complex information | l Time-consuming |

Training and Procedure Documents: The Executive Housekeeper is responsible to set the systems and procedures of the department and documents them in the form of manuals. She may get this done by external consultants or may do this by herself. Chain operations may adopt the training and procedural manuals from their principle. They become the standard ways by which things are done. Training manuals are adaptations of procedural manuals with the specific purpose of imparting training. They are used by trainers or coaches who are working people and have been given the responsibilities of training. Housekeeping supervisors are the principle coaches in the Housekeeping Department.

|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| l Is a point of reference | l Long and complex                                         |

| l Document of authority   | l May not be understood l Requires someone to explain them |

Notices are official communications that apply to all staff. They form an important part of a housekeepers communication to her team. We must realise that the housekeeping is a 24hour operation.  The  housekeeper  cannot  be  present  all  the  time.  She  has  to  rely  on  notices  to communicate information of common interest. Notices are displayed on notice boards accessible to  all  housekeeping  personnel.  In  housekeeping,  the  general  notice  board  is  placed  at  the Housekeeping Control Desk. The type of notices that the housekeeper displays are:

- 1. Management policies and procedures and amendments in them.
- 2. List of VIPs in the house on a daily basis.
- 3. List of groups in the house.
- 4. List of airline crews in the house.
- 5. List of rooms that are out-of-order and under maintenance.
- 6. Weekly work schedules and time-tables.
- 7. Weekly spring cleaning schedules.
- 8. Special functions and events in the house.
- 9. Appreciation letters from the management, guests and herself.
- 10. Rules and regulations and amendments to them.
- 11. National holidays and schedule amendments.
- 12. Festival greetings.

Here are some tips for preparing notices:

- 1. The notice must have a heading; e.g. National Holiday; New Linen Exchange Policy; Weekly Work Schedule; etc.
- 2. The font must be large so that everyone can read easily.
- 3. Information must be short. Lengthy information is likely to be ignored.
- 4. Must be signed. Employees like to see the authority sending the information.

- 5. Notices regarding new or amended policies and procedures must invite those who seek clarification and the person to contact.
- 6. Personal messages are not permitted on official notice boards.
- 7. Notices must be on clean paper and pinned firmly.

## Oral Communication

We have seen in the chapter vii the importance of interpersonal communication. The chapter explained the barriers in such communication. Oral communication is difficult and needs proper understanding and practice to be effective. Most human relation problems arise from improper verbal communication. Part of a housekeepers professionalism is the way she communicates. This section shall deal with the types of oral or verbal communication. Such communication occurs on a moment to moment basis in a typical working day. It may be over the telephone; while giving instructions to staff; during a meeting; while taking an interview; or making a formal presentation to the staff. It is, therefore, vital for all housekeeping staff, especially the Executive Housekeeper, to hone their oral communication skills and make themselves effective.

## Oral Communication

| Advantages                               | Disadvantages                 |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| l Ensures comprehension through feedback | l No written record           |
| l Immediacy                              | l Meetings are time consuming |
| l Courtesy &amp; interest                    | l Emotional involvement       |

## Meetings

Unplanned encounters are those sudden, unplanned meetings that occur casually in corridors and workplaces. During these encounters an employee can receive or give instructions; listen to a  grievance;  pass  information;  etc.  Such  meetings  are  best  for  short  messages,  non-critical information; and not planned. If the information like an instruction is given, it is prudent for the person to ask the receiver to repeat the instruction. Sometimes the housekeeper may receive information. It is professional practice to carry a notepad and pencil in the pocket to jot such information. She can then use those jottings to take action at the appropriate time.

## Unplanned Encounters

- l Lack of control
- l Spontaneous responses
- l Suitable for uncomplicated information

<!-- image -->

Planned Meetings are  very formal and important. A meeting is a congregation of relevant people to discuss a subject. They are held for several reasons:

- 1. To coordinate events.
- 2. To discuss a crisis.
- 3. To communicate changes.

## 190

- 4. To seek opinions on a serious matter,
- 5. To communicate plans and budgets.
- 6. To educate and inform.

Meetings are driven by agendas. Agendas are a list of issues that will be discussed. The agenda is prepared by the person who is chairing the meeting. Members of the meeting can send the issues they wish to be taken up at the meeting. Agendas must be circulated in advance so that participants can prepare for them. All meetings must have a chairperson who will monitor the proceedings and maintain time boundaries. Meetings must have a starting time and finishing time. We know that meetings consume time and unless they are properly monitored, punctuality of time may not be maintained. Therefore, it is important for the participants to be on time. Meetings must also be held at a place with least distraction. Telephone calls during a meeting are taboo. Participants chosen for a meeting are those that matter to the issues that will be discussed and are, therefore, required to contribute. A meeting is enriched with discussion and debate. Unfortunately,  meetings  are  the  place  where  people  bring  their  egos  as  they  are  put  in  the frontline. It is a place where politics can play a part. Many sensitive issues should be decided outside the meeting to arrive at a consensus so that no one is embarrassed in the meeting. An important aspect of meetings is the minutes .  The chairperson must assign someone to take minutes. Minutes record the decisions taken and the actions required. An important part when recording actions is to mention the expected date of completion of the action. Minutes must be distributed immediately to enable members to take action.

An executive housekeeper attends the following meetings in the course of her duties:

- 1. The daily morning General Managers information and coordination meetings.
- 2. Coordination meetings with the Head of maintenance and laundry.
- 3. Supervisors meeting for coordination, especially of special events.
- 4. Meetings of the Purchase Committee.
- 5. Front Office meetings, especially at critical occupancy periods.
- 6. Sales and marketing meeting in case of a special event or promotion.
- 7. Food and Beverage meeting in case of a special food promotion.
- 8. Meetings with government agencies e.g. Department of Occupational Hazard; Classification Committee; fire brigade; etc.

## Planned Meetings

- l More control of the encounter
- l Can evaluate responses
- l Allows discussion and debate
- l Can be recorded in minutes
- l Involves the people concerned
- l Permits different views
- l Allows group decision-making
- l Time consuming

Formal Presentations: Periodically the Executive Housekeeper is required to make presentations to the management and her staff. A presentation is a formal communication to a body of people who matter. The purpose of the presentation could be to inform, to obtain a decision or to request an action. For example, presentations can be made to put forward a budget proposal; a renovation plan; announcing new policies to her team; or a new landscape. Such presentations put her in the spotlight and she has to be very professional in her presentation, planning and delivery. In planning a presentation, there are four stages that one goes through:

- l Planning
- l Organising Information
- l Structuring your communication
- l Clarity

Planning the Presentation: When planning, there are four considerations to be kept in mind:

- l PURPOSE identifying the objective of the communication.
- l To inform
- l Obtaining a decision
- l Request action
- l AUDIENCE identifying those one is communicating with
- l Who they are
- l What they need to know
- l Intellectual capacity
- l Circumstances of the communication
- l What will appeal or motivate them
- l Your relationship with them
- l STRUCTURE organising the material you wish to communicate
- l Introduction
- l Body
- l Conclusion
- l STYLE identifying the appropriate vocabulary, formality &amp; tone of voice.
- l Formal or Informal, technical or ordinary
- l Match the vocabulary to the receiver
- l Superiors or subordinates
- Organising Information: This stage has three considerations:
- l Identifying what information you need
- l Gathering information
- l Organising information to receivers needs

Structuring the Communication: There are four key aspects in structuring:

- l Flow &amp; development of points
- l A  B  C  D

## 192

- l Flagging
- l Paragraphs for new thoughts

## l Headings

- l Headings
- l Sub-Headings

## l Numbering

- l 2
- l 2.1
- l 2.1.1
- l 2.1.1.1

## l Lay-out

- l Be consistent
- l Be sparing in use of change in fonts, italics
- l White space helps
- l Take care of bullets &amp; numbering

## Formal Presentations

- l Covers large bodies of people
- l Visual aids are essential
- l Time consuming
- l Needs logistics
- l Does not guarantee assimilation
- l Suitable for experts not easily available all the time

Interviews: One of the most valuable types of oral communication is the interview. While most of us relate interviews to the hiring process, there are a number of other interviews in an executive housekeepers work:

<!-- image -->

- 1. Recruitment interviews used as a selection method to shortlist candidates.
- 2. Appraisal interviews conducted to determine individual performance for the purpose of rewards and recognition.
- 3. Counselling interviews applied when an employee has a grievance or deficiency and needs superiors to correct the situation.
- 4. Disciplinary interviews to ascertain the reasons for indiscipline and determine the type of punishment required.

Interviews are one-to-one confidential meetings. All interviews require special skills to elicit information  from  another  personthe  most  important  being  listening  skills.  Lesson  3.2 Recruitment and Selection gives greater details on interviews.

## Telephone Calls

| Advantages                         | Disadvantages                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| l Speed in communications          | l Comes at awkward moments                    |
| l Good for immediate communication | l Puts you on the line                        |
| l Can get receiver at any time     | l Needs special skills                        |
| l Eliminates body language         | l Communication based on words and voice only |
| l Covers long distances            | l Unable to see each other                    |

Telephones are the most potent tools in modern work life. While the table telephone restricts calls to the office only, the mobile phone makes callers accessible to receivers at any time and anywhere. The slide above lists advantages and disadvantages of telephones. While most points are  self-explanatory,  one  point  listed  under  Disadvantages  needs  further  explanation.  This mentions that telephones need special skills. What are those skills?

- 1. The phone must be answered promptly (within three rings).
- 2. The receiver must identify his/her name and department.
- 3. The receiver must listen carefully without distraction.
- 4. The receiver must summarise the callers message to confirm that the message has been understood. The caller gets an opportunity to clarify the message.
- 5. The receiver must respond in a clear voice and speak slowly.
- 6. The receiver must keep a notepad and pencil readily available to take messages.
- 7. The receiver must tell the caller the action s/he is going to take in response to the message.
- 8. The receiver must state to the caller if it is an inconvenient time to receive the call and that she will call back. Then, call back when free.

## 3.5 TRAINING &amp; DEVELOPMENT

## Overview

Training is perhaps the most vital activity today. The world is changing very fast and the only way to keep up is through training. Today we see the use of computers in every aspect of  business  life.  New  software  makes  processing  of information  easier.  Changes  like  these  require  new knowledge and skills. Technology has made vast strides in our daily lives. It is not surprising that technology has crept into the hospitality industry, which has traditionally been a hands-on industry. We see micros in food operations, networked reporting systems, wake-up call software, Mini bars, Food dispensers in hotel floors, etc. Obsolescence is becoming a word much feared these days. Technology is

<!-- image -->

getting outdated every eighteen months. Camera and mobile telephone industries are changing technology every six months. Housekeeping students and professionals need to keep up to date in their careers, to survive. Progressive hotels must build training into their way of life.

To start with, we need to distinguish between training, development and education.

Training is the learning process in which an employee acquires the knowledge, skills and attitudes that lead to changes in behaviour to meet some performance objectives. Therefore, training is performance driven and used in work environments.

Development is the continuous improvement of the human capital. Employees with experience need to develop for higher positions as their jobs enlarge and enrich.

Education is  learning that contributes to total life growth. The time we went to school and college was indeed boring because we wondered how trigonometry, history or social science would help us in our career. Education is not performance driven, but a system to help us adjust to the environment around us and assimilate it better. The new buzzword in the work context is continuous education. Unless we update ourselves in the way life is unfolding we are soon to become outdated in our thinking. As a matter of fact, continuous education is not a luxury but a means of survival nowadays.

## Organisational Viewpoint about T raining

Organisations train for the following reasons generally:

- l Convert competencies into currencies: Specialized skills and behaviour can become the cutting edge for many hotels. For example, a professional concierge is a rarity. A multiskilled houseman is a distinct advantage to a hotel with limited payroll budgets. A room-boy at a resort can double-up as a bell boy during the day.
- l To get a competitive advantage: Training  does  give  the  hotel  and  housekeeping a distinct edge. Large organisations have invested big money in setting up training schools of note. The Oberoi Hotel School, The Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration at Manipal, are some Indian examples. These schools bring out human products that are uniquely special to the organisation. The Educational Institute of the American Hotel &amp;

<!-- image -->

Lodging Association in Michigan and Orlando was originally sponsored by large American chains to produce basic standards of knowledge and skills for their hotels worldwide.

- l Fear of obsolescence: Every organisation fears obsolescence. With so many new hotels opening, the customer is pampered and is quick to forget an old way.
- l Changes to new technologies: The change in technology as explained earlier is a good reason  to  update  oneself.  The  introduction  of  computerization  in  hotel  systems  and procedures is a huge reason for training.
- l Globalisation: This phenomenon has brought great opportunities. Not only has it opened doors to global employment but also has shrunk the divide in work styles. A room attendant in Baku, Azerbaijan would soon have the same job description as the room attendant in Dublin,  Ireland.  Large  American  chain  operations  worldwide  have  introduced  certain common practices to local professionals wherever their hotels have been located, be it Madrid, Manila or Mumbai.
- l Improve productivity: As human capital is expensive and scarce, the challenge is to make existing staff productive. This is done by technology, work design and outsourcing. This brings in a whole new dimension to traditional ways of doing things.
- l Retain customers: The hospitality industry recognizes that the cutting edge is customer service. Training in this one aspect can bring customers back again and again.
- l Avoid lawsuits: The hotel industry is subject to many laws and regulations to protect guests. There are laws concerning hygiene, sanitation, storage, etc. Lawsuits can result in high fines or even the closure of the establishments.

## When is Training Required?

Organisations opt for training when they observe the following training gaps (Fig. 3.8), categorised into knowledge, skills and attitude.

Fig 3.8 Training Gaps

| Knowledge                                                                                                                                                                        | Skills                                                                                                                                                                             | Attitude                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| l Lack of job knowledge l Cost increase l Supervisors doing lower jobs l High waste l Hygiene concerns l More supervision required l Customer loss l Lack of concern for quality | l Under-confidence l Drop in standards l Management complaints l Mistakes l Staff increase l Drop in sales l Productivity drop l Inter-departmental complaints l Delays in service | l Customer complaints l In-fighting l Absenteeism l Shirking responsibility l Falling morale |

## Focused Training Options

Organisations take the responsibility of training for specific performance objectives. Organisations earlier  had  huge  budgets  to  train  employees.  This  they  did  because  employees  planned long

<!-- image -->

careers in an organisation. Today the employee no longer gives that loyalty and is willing to change for salary because he or she recognises that his or her career is short. Hotels worldwide are opting for younger workforces to keep the organisation fresh and infused with new ideas. Hotels can also exploit the energy of the young for long hours of work. Organisations have now rationalised this approach and are now willing to invest in critical training that will directly affect performance in critical areas such as:

- l Customer Service
- l Quality
- l Teamwork
- l Technological changes in the organisation.
- l Productivity improvement

## Individual Viewpoint about Training

Individuals do recognize the importance of training to keep up to date. They also know that organisations are not willing to spend big training budgets on them for fear of losing them to competition. Individuals, therefore, have no choice but to put their precious earnings into continuous education and training. The employee also recognises that their careers could be cut short by the next  generation  who  is  coming  with  the  latest  knowledge  and  skills.  Individuals  train  for  the following reasons.

- l Job security
- l Growth
- l Improvement
- l Challenge
- l Return on investment
- l Sense of discovery
- l Improve self-worth
- l Recognition
- l Sense of achievement
- l Knowledge is power
- l Social acceptability
- l Contributions to work place
- l Fear of obsolescence
- l Status

## Issues of Adult Learning

At the workplace, adults get trained. There are serious statutory issues of hiring underage people. Training gets more challenging with a mature age group. They need special treatment and have to be addressed in different ways than teaching school or college kids. Lets look at these challenges:

## 198

- l What is in it for me? This is the first question asked by adults. Adults look at training as a measure of improving their status or earning power. They evaluate training in terms of hard currency that will come to them. They also look at survival and see training as a way to prolong their career.
- l Life, task or problem centred: Adults are motivated when they believe that the training is going to directly solve, or enhance some of their performance issues. They like to get to the point and are intolerant or bored with issues that do not directly concern them.
- l Management commitment: Adults first assess the importance given to training, by the management. If management does not support training and the generation of new ideas, then training becomes a pastime than a vehicle for change.
- l Cost of negligent training: The hotel is subject to many laws as they serve people. There are laws concerning hygiene, sanitation, storage of food, safety, etc. The law prescribes training in these areas and insists on keeping records for the government inspectors to evaluate. Apart from the statutory requirement, there is the aspect of not training. Staff can follow wrong practices that could result in asset losses, damages, litigations, fines and even closure of the premises. Imagine the implications of wrong food storage resulting in food poisoning or misuse of inflammable material that can result in fire.
- l Diversity: Modern workforces are multicultural. There are religious issues, language issues, perceptions, sexual preference, gender, socioeconomic backgrounds, literacy levels, learning styles  and  backgrounds  that  have  to  be  contended  with  in  training.  Pork  is  a  taboo  to Muslims, meat to vegetarians, hand gestures to others. A trainer has to take into account several nuances before going into training. This requires awareness and flexibility on part of the trainer.
- l Learning disabilities: Adults have visual, auditory and kinesthetic disabilities. There are those who have difficulty to understand the written word. They prefer diagrams, audiovisuals, illustrations or role plays to learn. Some have difficulty in understanding concepts and need to feel objects to learn. They learn better with demonstrations and hands-on training.
- l Ego: Managing the egos of adult learners is a challenging issue. Adults do not like to lose face. They find it difficult to accept that they do not know. A trainer has to be tactful to deal with such situations. One method is by enabling adults towards self-discovery.

## How People Learn

People learn at various stages. The ultimate objective for a learner is to attain mastery in a skill. They go through four stages of learning to achieve mastery.

The diagram below shows the stages well:

<!-- image -->

## Levels of Learning

Unconscious Incompetence: In this stage, a learner is unaware and unable to perform a task. This is applicable usually to raw recruits who are new to a skill. Apprentices fall in this category and require motivation and confidence to proceed further.

Conscious Incompetence: In this stage, the learner has been made aware of the skill. This is acquired through knowledge instruction where a concept is made clear. The learner is still unable to do the task perfectly.

Conscious Competence: This stage brings the learner to a degree of skill. This is achieved through demonstration and hands on practice. There is a studied effort to perform the task.

Unconscious Competence: This stage is when the learner performs the tasks automatically just like walking, swimming or driving. This is the stage of mastery.

## Training Methodology

The training methodology used is the key to the learning process. The wrong choice of methodology could make learning difficult. As a guideline the following graph (Fig. 3.9) indicates the effectiveness of methodology.

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

It shows how much a person retains after three days of receiving information. Any methodology that uses the auditory function only, is the weakest. The lecture method, therefore, is the poorest form of ensuring learning. Ironically, it is the one most used. By bringing in visuals like graphs, pictures, etc we enhance the retention level to about forty percent after three days. However, when we see others doing a task, the retention is greatly enhanced to sixty percent. Methodologies that employ demonstrations or movies that show the performance of tasks are greatly effective. The best level for ensuring retention is when we do tasks ourselves. Hands-on training or on-thejob training has got its popularity on this account.

The chart below (Fig. 3.10) gives the complete range of training methodologies available. They have been listed according to where they are most effective in terms of conveying knowledge, skills or attitudes.

## Methodologies to transfer KNOWLEDGE

Lectures are given when knowledge has to be imparted to a large body of people. It requires an expert on a subject who needs little time to be able to talk. The challenge is to get the attention of listeners.

Tutoring is the knowledge shared by an expert with a learner, on a oneto-one basis. This method is more effective than a lecture but will need the dedicated time of a trainer to one person. This is effective when there are few learners to be taught.

Symposium is  a  meeting  of  experts  on  a  particular  subject.  The participants are passive as they watch the experts exchange their views. It is best used to acquire advanced knowledge on a subject.

<!-- image -->

Seminars are conducted when a group of advanced students want to learn a specific subject. Experts on the subject give presentations on the subject followed by an interactive question and answer session with participants.

<!-- image -->

Programmed Instruction is one in which a learner studies a manual presented in modules (or installments) followed by quizzes to establish the proficiency in that

module. Several modules lead to a complete subject. This is a self-study done through distance education

Group discussions get together groups of learners (maximum 15) to discuss a subject. The benefit is that students are exposed to facets of the topic that they may have overlooked or not visited.

Case Study is a group discussion of a real live situation. Learners get the background of the case and work towards finding a solution

<!-- image -->

to the problems. This method remains academic and does not solve problems in the real workplace.

<!-- image -->

Projects are academic exercises that encourage learners to make a report on a subject. This method encourages research, project implementation and report writing.

Audio-visual methods  include  training  films,  slides, transparencies, etc. Students comment on the displayed visual.

Conferences are larger occasions when noted experts are called to give inputs on a subject or theme to learners studying or practicing the chosen subject. The conferences have a plenary session that includes  everybody  followed  by  smaller  groups  who discuss issues to solve specific problems.

Field Trips are used to expose learners to locations, which cannot be reproduced in a classroom. For example, learners may visit other hotels and restaurants followed by a debriefing session in the classroom.

Brainstorming is used by people, qualified on a subject, to solve specific problems.

<!-- image -->

Guided discussion is one where a facilitator leads a discussion to cover pre-arranged issues of learning.

## Methodologies to impart SKILLS

<!-- image -->

On-the-job training is placing learners in live situations to learn from an assigned coach or against specified tasks. This is the most  popular  method  used  and  most  effective.  The  only disadvantage is that trainees may pick up the wrong ways of doing things and may make mistakes, which may be costly in terms of money and the customers goodwill. They may also come in the way  of  busy  workers  who  are  concerned  with  their  actual operational performance than teaching.

Role Play is best used for behavioural training.

## 202

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

The learners become the actors who are required to act out a scene presented by the trainer. A good example of this method is in customer   service  training.

Management Games are used to simulate management situations in a study situation. Team building simulations are a good example.

Transactional Analysis is an effective method to improve interactions between people. It works on three ego states of Parent, Adult and Child. Each individual is required to respond to the appropriate ego state in given situations to make the transaction effective.

Communication exercises are designed to illustrate barriers in interpersonal communication. This could be in the form of Chinese Whispers to illustrate the distortion of communication when it passes through many people.

In-basket exercises are problem-solving exercises with current live problems of an organisation. These problems are tested in the classroom without fear of wrong decisions.

Demonstrations are actual performances of tasks by an instructor to a learner or a body of

learners who watch but do not participate in the task. The benefit of this method is that learners get to see the actual task, which improves their learning considerably. Cooking demonstrations are a good example.

Interactive  videos/CDs are  used  for  self-study.  Learners respond  to  questions  after  a  body  of  instructions  has  been presented in parts. The benefit of this method is that situations in a video/CD are dramatised to give a more effective learning.

Workshops are meetings by groups to solve actual problems.

<!-- image -->

Coaching is done by an instructor, on a one-to-one basis, either at the workplace or outside the work area. This is best used for skill development.

Incident  Method is  to  train  learners  in  problemsolving  and  decision-making  by  providing information on an incident in phases. Decisions keep changing with new additional information.

Field projects are real research studies of real work places. A trip to a brewery or a vineyard would be a field trip.

Simulation exercises are computer-aided methods to give the individual a virtual reality of a situation.

## Methodologies to Develope ATTITUDES

Sensitivity training is a method of dealing with real feelings. The instructor has to be specially trained in this methodology to deal with human sensitivity. The learner goes through three phases of unfreezing, exploration and freezing of attitudes.

Fish Bowl Exercises deal with the actual feelings of work groups towards each other. This methodology is ideal for building teams.

Meditation is a method of learning to improve concentration and managing stress, towards a total well-being. This method too requires to be administered by a trained person.

## LESSON  3 Duties of an Executive Housekeeper

Mentoring is a process of assigning an elder and experienced person in an organisation to a new recruit. His or her role would be to lead the learner through the cultural, political and performance  aspects  in  the  organisation.  The  mentor  is someone who does not evaluate the learners performance or has a say in his or her salaries, benefits and promotions. This ensures objectivity in dealing with the learner.

Performance Counseling is a method borrowed from sports training to give learners the right attitudes to excel through inspirational talks.

<!-- image -->

If we are to analyse the methodologies, we can see that the ones that ensure 80% learning after three days are on-the-job training, coaching, sensitivity training, fish bowl, transactional analysis and meditation. The most practical methodologies for skill training at normal workplaces are on-the-job training, role-play and coaching. Performance counseling is the best way to develop attitudes. Knowledge is best developed through projects, exercises, demonstrations, audio-visual methods and workshops. Knowledge must relate directly to work performance to sustain the motivation to learn.

## Training Aids

There are many training aids to assist in learning. For a long time the chalkboard was used as the only aid in teaching. Projection equipments were rare and expensive. Whiteboards, with nonpermanent marker pens, replaced chalkboards as a cleaner and more efficient method of teaching. The 80s saw the emergence of the over-head projector, which became the standard equipment in

most training classrooms. The OHP brought a new interest to see written material and diagrams clearly. The OHP uses transparencies that give better reproduction of information. Projectors were supported by Flip Chart  boards  and  chalkboards.  Today  the  laptop  computers  with Microsoft  PowerPoint  software  have  made  presentations  colourful, picturesque and innovative. Laptop presentations are projected through an LCD projector, which is presently expensive. Soon technology will make them cheaper and replace them with innovative inventions. The whiteboard for instance, has witnessed a revolution. We can take copies from these boards or transfer information to computers.

## The Training Process

Figure 3.11 below depicts the training process clearly:

Fig. 3.11 The Training Process

<!-- image -->

- l Establishing a training policy: Policies  regarding training have to emerge from the corporate or the owner to get commitment of the establishment to training. These corporate polices are translated into the operational policies that make training a continuous and committed way of life.
- l Establishing standard operating procedures: The logical flow from policies is the operational systems and procedures, which have to be standardised to ensure consistency.
- l Task Analysis: From these operational procedures flow the subtasks that make up the procedure. These are documented through a Task Analysis that addresses what has to be done, how it is to be done and the standards that have to be maintained for each sub-task. The task analysis becomes the base document for training. (See the task list in  Lesson 3.2 under Recruitment and Selection )
- l Defining training needs: This is an exercise done in response to the symptoms indicated in the earlier section When is Training required?
- l Planning training: Plans include setting training objectives, developing lesson plans and organising the venue, methodology and training aids.
- l Conducting training: The training must follow the training objectives, lesson plans and methodologies selected.
- l Evaluating training: it is important to evaluate training for their effectiveness. Trainers want to know whether training has achieved the desired level of learning; learners want to confirm their level of retention of knowledge and skills; and management want to know whether training has achieved their strategic objectives.
- l Follow-up is the step taken to correct/improve on the training effort. This exercise revisits every aspect of the training process to make it more effective.

## The Trainer

The trainer is a very special person as he or she influences the learners in a very special way. Trainers are experienced success stories in an organisation, who reflect all that is good about the organisation. S/he is a role model that everyone respects and the learner looks up to. S/he loves to teach and has the patience to see the gradual process of change of the learner. S/he has exceptional  communication skills  with  perhaps  a  sense  of  humor.  While  these  are  the  noble qualities of a trainer, there are other important qualities that are essential.

## 3.6 LEADERSHIP AND MOTIVATION

## Leadership

The much used term a born leader comes from the pre-industrial age of kings when leadership roles were hereditary. A prince was born into a leadership role whether he was intrinsically a leader or not. This led social scientists of the day to list traits that suited a king and the princes were cajoled or beaten into those traits. A leader, therefore, had to have traits like self-discipline; power command; decision-making; good communication, etc. This was the thumb rule for good rulers. As situations changed social scientists found it difficult to reach agreement on a common set of leadership traits.

This led to an approach of defining styles. The styles were based on who made decisions. From this emerged the following styles:

Autocratic style

leader asks others but makes the final decision

Dictatorial style

leader makes all decisions

Persuasive style

leader sells ideas of decisions already made

Democratic style

leader involves all and goes by the majority vote

Authoritarian style

leader defines scope of authority and monitors it

Bureaucratic style

leader makes decisions by the rule book

Charismatic style

leader makes decisions by his sheer personality

Delegative style

leader gives broad parameters within which people make their own decisions.

This approach believed that leaders could effectively control the behaviour of their subordinates. They adopted a style that they were most comfortable with based on their own personality. There has been no consensus as to which style is the best. In fact, later studies showed that styles can be the best in certain situations. For example, a dictatorial style would fit in well in a fire emergency, while communicating a change in policy will require a persuasive style. There is no leadership style that is a success in all situations. Situations, therefore, dictate the best style for the occasion.

It was well into the industrial revolution that organisations started thinking about leadership and motivation when organisations were concerned about productivity to produce as many goods in a shift. They turned their attention to social scientists for help. One of the forerunners of those times was Douglas McGregor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who discovered that managers tended to create situations at the workplace that they are most comfortable with. He detected two distinct leadership styles which he termed Theory X style and Theory Y style. His study found that the attitude of the leader was crucial to success and productivity. Theory X leaders believed that people do not like to work; that they have to be cajoled to work; that they should rather be told what to do than left to think for themselves. In other words, the leaders were dictatorial and authoritarian. This seemed to be a rather archaic style of leadership that outlived its time because workers were educated and intelligent now. The other end of the pendulum was the Theory Y leader who believed: people do not like or dislike work but develop an attitude towards work based on experiences; while authoritarian methods get things done, they have severe side effects. There are other kinds of styles to employ; people set goals for themselves if they see some possibility of a reward, either material or psychological; and finally if people are

given the right circumstances they do not shun responsibility. While Theory Y did not achieve dramatic  results  and  transformation  as  Theory  X  did,  the  people  were  more  psychologically secure and work went on even in the absence of the leader. Theory Y was a great step in thinking, perfected over the years.

Blake and Mouton made another great frog leap in leadership study. They were able to define leadership on a bi-dimensional grid that had 81 situations, as shown below:

<!-- image -->

In this grid leadership style is based on two factorstask and people.

People low, Task high (9.1): Here the leader gives task the highest importance at the cost of people considerations. Team leaders prioritise work and determine outputs desired. They are comfortable with systems and rules and can set high standards. They lead with close supervision. The people are likely to be low on commitment. They will work steadily when the leader is present but will slacken when the leader is absent. This is much the Theory X leader. At a positive level this may be appropriate to crisis situations where the best shall command and people feel secure.

People high, task low (1.9): This is more like a country club where the leader gives concern to people issues and sacrifices the task. Such leadership style is bound to fail because the tasks and objectives are not achieved. People can take advantage of the leader. At another level, a

## 210

leader may think that his people are capable to accomplish the task and therefore, leaves them alone to achieve results. He concentrates on encouraging them to better results.

People low, Task low (1.1): In a worst scenario this shows an impoverished situation where the leader abdicates his responsibility to people or the task. The leader is concerned with maintaining his leadership position and concentrates on external powers that can make this happen. The organisation is bound to decay and die. At a positive level, the leader is so confident that his team are mature and capable to achieve results on their own that he delegates the internal running of operations to them.

Medium/people, Medium/task (5.5): This is the middle of the road where people and tasks are moderately balanced but not enough to bring outstanding results. Such leaders will get average performance only. A leader may adopt this style when he is new to the organisation and needs time to understand the task requirements and people.

People High, task high (9.9): High priority is given to both people and task. The leader takes a participative approach through which he achieves high performance. The people are highly motivated  and  conflicts  are  low.  Quality  of  work  is  good  and  both  employee  and  customer satisfaction is achieved. This is claimed to be the ideal situation in which both the organisation and the people prosper.

Kieth Blanchard brought in another revolutionary study where he narrowed the 81 situations in the managerial grid to only four situations that leaders need to worry about. The situations are caused by what he called the maturity of the team or individual. Maturity was defined as the ability (or competence) and willingness (or motivation). He worked on the bi-dimensional grid and proposed four styles:

<!-- image -->

Directive Style: Is when the leader makes decisions with little input from employees who merely act on instructions. This style is used in situations where work is done by beginners like apprentices and trainees who are unable to do a job and unwilling to perform them because of their nervousness. They need close supervision and guidance.

Persuasive Style: Is when the leader makes the decisions but at the same time encourages the individual or team to support his decision instead of forcing his decision on the team. The employees have low ability at this stage but are willing to perform tasks as the leader encourages them. The leader sets higher standards and gives the individual or team the confidence to perform.

Consultative Style: Is when the individual or team is high in competence but unwilling. These are mature experienced groups who may not have the managerial qualities to reach leadership positions. They are normally old timers.

The leader would take them into confidence and consult with them on how to proceed in a situation. Their willingness to help improves because they are made part of the decisionmaking process.

Delegative Style: Is  when  the  individual  or  team  has  high  competence  and  are  also  well motivated. They can be left to perform without supervision. These employees need broad directions and are empowered with decisionmaking authority. They are also given deadlines and milestones when work is reviewed.

What do all these studies mean to the Executive Housekeeper? How can she interpret them into an effective leadership approach?

- 1. The housekeeper must examine her assumptions about people and how to lead them. She needs to identify her own leadership style through reliable psychometric tests available as also  plain  feedback  from  those  she  leads.  She  will  need  to  work  on  weak  areas  while emphasizing her strong ones.
- 2. She must balance both concern for tasks and objectives with concern for people.
- 3. She must know her team well. This she does by spending time with individuals on a one-toone basis to understand their abilities and motivation. She must know individual levels of competence and draw on their strengths, while having action plans of development to overcome their weaknesses.
- 4. She must assess situations and people that require, one of the four styles. For this she must develop these styles effectively and know the attitude and language to be followed in each style.
- 5. She must communicate the departmental objectives on a long and short term basis so the employees know the direction in which they are going. In other words, there must be a transparency of the goals of the hotel, department and their immediate workplace.
- 6. Employees require feedback on how they are doing. People like to know where they stand. She must institute a fair evaluation system that is designed to improve performance and willingness and not to destroy them. Feed back on performance is given daily in briefings as also during the annual appraisal time.
- 7. People like to see their leader as a coach and mentor. Be approachable to resolve conflicts, grievances and doubts. Be personally responsible for the growth of the team by introducing training as a way of life. This can be achieved when there is a degree of trust achieved through transparency and candor.
- 8. She must build self-confidence in her team with the objective of making them selfreliant.
- 9. She must be part of the team and be humble enough to learn from her subordinates, some of whom may be older and more experienced than her.
- 10. Celebration and rewards are equally important as work and toil. She must be free to give recognition. Recognition motivates.

## Motivation

A motive is an inner drive to achieve an objective. Motivation is, therefore, the process of releasing the inner drive to achieve an objective. From this we plainly see that motivation has to be generated

## 212

from within an individual and not without. Readers must keep this in focus when considering motivation.

## Pre-industrial Revolution

Motivation in pre-industrial revolution times was based on the fact that the general workers were illiterate and therefore, preferred to be told what to do rather than think for themselves. Education was the privilege of the nobility in those days. They motivated people by punitive methods which Fredrick Herzberg later called negative KITA (kick in the a.!). Those who performed well were given material rewards. People were promised such rewards before they performed jobs. This Herzberg called positive KITA because in either cases motivation to perform was provided from the outside. Early artisans kept their trade within the family. While they used carrot and stick methods, they provided concern and care for their kith and kin. The head of the small business was, therefore, their provider and caretaker creating great loyalty.

## Industrial Revolution

These conditions existed for centuries till the industrial revolution in 1700 A.D.

Machines changed the criterion for hire from relationship with the owner, to competence. If a relative could not operate a machine, he was of no use. The person hired had to come with knowledge  and  skills.  The  work  force  then  consisted  of  people  of  varied  socio-economic backgrounds. Mass production by conveyor belt had only one mantra productivity. The more they produced the better was the growth of the business. Motivation adopted the age old carrot and stick methods that resulted in excessive labour turnover due to work monotony and fatigue; workers sank into depression; and they lost tempers quickly and resigned impulsively.

## Hawthorne Studies

The quest for productivity resulted in organisations seeking help from academics for a formula. In 1927 A.D, Hawthorne Works of Western Electric Company in Chicago hired Elton Mayo of Harvard Business School to provide a solution to a very demoralized work force. He created an informal test group who were subjected to various conditionslight, tea-breaks, working conditions etc. In spite of different conditions ranging from good to bad, this test group displayed incredible productivity.

He made a startling discovery that workers tended to cluster together into informal groups in order to fill a void in their lives (alienation) and this void resulted from a basic need for cooperation and comradeship which modern industrial organisations had ignored. Further, these informal groups could exert a far stronger pull on the workers motivation than the combined strength of money, discipline, and even job security itself. The test group were an informal group who decided to break all records!

He told  managers  and  supervisors  to  improve  communications  so  that  all  would  have  a sympathetic insight into the minds of each other and to put supervision into the hands of men to whom a respect for their fellowmen came naturally. Alienation was a demon and people needed the touch of humanness in a mechanistic world. Managers and supervisors were to be trained in the skills of listening, understanding and eliciting cooperationquite a departure from the classical

<!-- image -->

image of an iron boss. He also found that workers liked to participate in managing their own work which informal groups provided. This re-enforces the belief that motivation must come from within and not externally. The concept of team spirit grew from here. By singling the test group out he gave these workers an elite feeling and attention, to which they were willing to give themselves whole-heartedly.

## Michigan Studies

In 1942, two social scientists Rensis Likert and Daniel Katz launched a sophisticated research better  known  as  the  Michigan  Studies.  They  wanted  to  know  the  secret  of  high  performing groups and low performing groups. They found the target groups who were clerical workers at the Prudential Insurance Company of America in Newark, New Jersey. There were distinctly two groups, high performing and low performing. They concentrated on the behaviour and attitudes of frontline supervisors. They discovered that supervisors that led high performing groups were characterized as employee centred and those leading low performing groups were production centred (or task centred). Employee Centred supervisors were task oriented too but gave more emphasis to its workers. Their supervisory tactic was to give their people a general outline of how the work was to be accomplished leaving the details up to the workers themselves. They assumed that  their  people  were  responsible  enough and capable to get things done without someone peering  over  their  shoulders.  The  employees  were  in  control.  The  task  oriented  supervisor considered his main job was to get the work done and looked at his people as pure instruments. He interfered with all decisions and provided close supervision. The study showed that the emphasis on productivity at the expense the dignity of workers was self-defeating. The employee centred supervisors were cooperative, democratic and amenable to reason; while the production centred supervisors were defensive, authoritarian and arbitrary.

## Theory of Needs

Abraham Maslow, a social scientist, brought the concept of human needs that changed the concept of motivation most dramatically by claiming that:

- 1. All humans have needs.
- 2. These needs can be collated into five broad categories.
- 3. The categories have an ascending hierarchical order.
- 4. That the needs of lower order must be satisfied to move to the needs of higher order. (Later scientists  proved that all needs can co-exist together in varying levels of importance to every individual).

Needs are essential to human well-being. These could include those that are essential to human survival such as food, water, clothing and shelter at the basic level, to those that are essential for social survival like belonging and status.

This was lucidly displayed in the famous Maslows Need Hierarchy as shown on next page.

Maslows Need Hierarchy

<!-- image -->

The needs start from the bottom and we shall examine how they impact on human beings.

Physiological Needs: These are the basic needs for survival such as food, water, clothing, shelter, air and sex (for procreation of the human species). The hotel industry recognizes this need and meets them by providing free duty meals that satisfies the need for food; uniforms for clothing needs; housing or an allowance for housing to meet the need for shelter; potable water in staff cafeterias; fresh air through climate control mechanismsfor example the kitchens and laundry which are very humid and hot especially in hot climates are provided with proper exhausts and fresh air supply; and a salary to start and propagate a family.

Security Needs: When survival is no longer an ever present danger there is a tendency to become more concerned with preserving this good fortune. The security need is both physical and emotional. The employees want to be sure that the organisation they are working in is physically safe from anything that may endanger the body. Hotels provide locks, fire warning systems, sprinklers, fire-fighting equipment, etc. to satisfy this need of physical safety. Employees want to be warned of wet floors and know the name of callers before responding to a telephone. A welltrained security staff protects the safety of guests and employees.

A workers need for emotional security comes in many ways. First is the need to be welcomed into the organisation and inducted well when they join; Then they want to know what is expected of them through job descriptions; they want to be treated with courtesy and respect; they want see that the property provides safe working conditions and safety training, especially in the use of equipment and carrying heavy loads. Grievance procedures, suggestion systems, performance evaluation are all organisational processes meant to give the employees emotional security.

Belonging: Human beings are social animals. They prosper and grow when interacting with others. This behaviour was noticed right from the early caveman who lived together to form tribes. We have seen in the Hawthorne studies that in the absence of attention and loneliness people formed informal groups to provide that sense of belonging. Membership to a group was a powerful motivator. Employees are given identity cards to identify them with the organisation. Establishments take welfare measures and provide social clubs where employees can meet for sport or social meetings.

Status and Self-Esteem: While status is the way others perceive us, self-esteem is the way we perceive ourselves. Employees within the industry are given ranks, perquisites and uniforms to distinguish them within and without the organisation. Hotels do have a hierarchy that sets a chain of command. People can aspire for higher positions in the organisation to improve their status. Self-Esteem is a bit tricky. The first step towards is to give employee respect and dignity. Selfesteem is also given by bestowing authority and empowering employees. Suggestion Schemes also permit employees to participate in the progress of the organisation by acting on their views and ideas.

Self Actualisation: This is a state where human beings reach their potential and are able to control  and  contribute  to  the  environment.  This  is  the  main  motivator  of  the  modern  age. Organisations provide the conditions for people to attain their full potential through delegation; training and development; accountability; job rotation; challenging tasks; etc. Employees want to feel  that  they  have  a  say  in  the  prosperity  of  the  organisation.  Personal  growth  by  attaining mastery over ones environment is potentially the most powerful motivator of all because unlike other motivators it can never be satiated.

## Pittsburgh Studies

One of the most sophisticated studies on work motivation came from Fredrick Herzberg and his colleagues at the Psychological Service of Pittsburgh. It is for this reason the study is called Pittsburgh Studies. They studied a more sophisticated group of 200 engineers and accountants. They were asked to recall specific incidents in their recent experience which made them feel either  good or bad. They found that good feelings were felt in the nature of work that they performed rather than background factors like money, security or working conditions. This led the researchers to classify those that they called motivators and those that they called hygiene factors. A motivator had an uplifting effect on attitudes or performance whereas hygiene factors provided no improvements but those that prevented loss of morale and efficiency.

The hygiene factors were things like pay, security, working conditions, and supervisory style. These were dissatisfiers. When they were inadequate, they had a significant negative effect on worker attitudes, but they had no important positive effect when they were properly administered. This showed that these factors, especially pay, did not motivate.

Motivators were satisfiers that left an uplifting impact such as recognition, growth, achievement, and challenge in the job. For this cadre of professionals, sustained motivation lay in assignments that pushed their capabilities to their limits.

## Competence, Affiliation and Achievement Motives

Robert W. White of Harvard University discovered in his research of work motivation that the individual is more than just a vehicle for a set of instincts; he is also an active observer and shaper of his environment. In the broadest sense, people like to be able to make things happen  to create events rather than merely await them passively. White called this desire for mastery the competence motive .  In  adults,  the  competence motive is very likely to express itself as a desire for job mastery and professional growth. A man who trusts his own ability to influence his environment will actually try to influence it more often and more boldly than someone who is inclined to let the environment influence him.

## 216

Stanley Schachter of the University of Minnesota discovered that people like other peoples company and that some like it more than others. This need for socializing was the affiliation motive . He confirmed Mayos theory that people formed informal groups in an impersonal work environment. He went further by saying that people sought the company of others for what they gave him as also for the sheer pleasure of it. Those that believe in a similar thing will seek each other out with urgency. They go through an excited process of comparing notes, speculating about the event, and seeking explanations. They get relief in exchanging notes. Misery certainly does love company. The informal group was an antidote for dull working environments and oppressive bosses. Groups provide pride, importance and security to the individual.

David C. McClelland from Harvard University led a group of psychologists on a research and discovered the achievement motive . They found that the achievement motive played a very vigorous role in the lives of people. This motive makes accomplishment an end in itself. People with this motive enjoy winning, in competing successfully with a difficult standard; this means more than money or recognition. The higher this motivation was in people, the higher was their rise in positions of greater power and responsibility. They were willing to take risks and wanted prompt,  precise  and  unmistakeable  feedback;  they  committed  themselves  emotionally  to accomplishing tasks.

## Future Approaches

The frontiers of human productivity already lie beyond decent supervisory relationships. The tightly controlled organisation is obsolete. Management will move toward greater flexibility and individual  responsibility  because  these  are  more  efficient  principles  of  organisation  than  the traditional chain of command. Organisations will believe in decentralisation, delegation and human development. Normal decision-making functions will be automated and will most probably replace middle management. People will have greater information to make better decisions so that younger generations will hold positions far greater than their forefathers at that age. Organisations will find ways to make good employees permanent stakeholders in the company by giving them a share of profits in addition to pay.

Jack Welsh ,  a  modern  guru,  the  CEO  who  turned  around  General  Motors  into  a  winning organisation recommends the following:

- l Human resource management must build leaders and careers.
- l Introduce a non-bureaucratic evaluation system.
- l Identify with unions and star performers.
- l Use the 20-70-10 principle in which 20% of the workers are stars that drive the organisation. 70% are the work horses who provide continuity to the organisation and are the heart and soul of the organisation. 10% are sliders and disrupters who are losing motivation and bring down the organisation because of their incompetence.
- l Keep the organisation as flat as possible with clear reporting relationships and responsibilities.

## Converting Studies into a Motivational Strategy

- 1. The manager must evaluate and restructure, if necessary, his own attitude towards people first. There are valuable psychometric tests, the most modern being the Circumplex, that identifies ones leadership style. The manager must perceive those working under him as

human beings with feelings and needs. They are not automatons within complex work machinery. They have a say in how work is to be conducted. (Michigan studies-Employee centred)

- 2. Know your people well and give them personal attention. The absence of a high touch will only alienate them and they will only run to informal groups which may or may not be productive. (Hawthorne Studies; Affiliation Motive)
- 3. Provide excitement in the job by job enrichment, job rotation and job enlargement. (Hygiene factor  nature of job converted to motivator  challenge in job; Achievement motive).
- 4. One of the greatest needs of todays workers is to have a feeling that he is in control of his environment and not vice versa. Delegate responsibility and give limited authority to the employee to execute his or her job. Once he is ready to assume this he can be accountable for his job. Set targets and standards and let the employee have ownership of his area. For example, there will soon be no floor supervisor but superior room attendants or teams who will own the floor or set of rooms. Very often supervisors assume all responsibility and authority for fear of losing control at the workplace. This is a misconception. Accountability gives the worker a purpose in life and the need to do his job well. It also releases the manager to do other more important things. (Competence Motive).
- 5. Chalk out common objectives with the employee and agree on norms to achieve them. This gives workers a security as to what is expected out of him and her. When he has met his objectives he certainly has a feeling of achievement. This feeling of achievement is the greatest motivator. (Employee centred supervisor/Achievement motivation).
- 6. Recognise good work done. This should not be a precondition of performance otherwise it lapses into positive KITAs. Recognize in public and institute such programmes as Best Employee of the Month. (Pittsburgh motivator of recognition)
- 7. Make training and development an important part of organisational life. Individuals must be nurtured to achieve their own potential and a mastery over their given field. (Growth as a powerful motivator-Pittsburgh studies)
- 8. Follow the 20-70-20 principle. Empower those 20% who drive the department. Delegate responsibilities and develop them into leaders. Do not take the 70% for granted but respect and recognize them for keeping the wheels of the department moving. The sliders must be encouraged to reach their peak potential with personalised action plans such as training, job enrichment and job rotation. Get rid of disrupters!

You are the new housekeeper of Hotel Winwood. Within the first week you find that you are receiving no cooperation from your employees. You discover that two long-standing and much respected housekeeping supervisors in the hotel were vying for the position. Employees are not meeting productivity standards. You check with the General Manager why they were not selected for the post. He claims that while one supervisor was capable, she lacked modern vision. The other supervisor incited employees against the management and had the power to disrupt work if confronted. The hotel has no union. What steps will you take to lead and motivate this team?

## 3.7 PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL

## Management by Objectives

The purpose of performance appraisal is to ascertain an individuals present and future value to the organisation. His present value is assessed by his past performance while his future value is determined by his present potential. A good appraisal would bring to light these two aspects. The

main fear  that  all  assessors  have  is  the  element  of subjectivity.  In  order  to  avoid  subjectivity  the  best approach would be to evaluate performance and not personality.  The  Management  by  Objectives  (MBO) has been a successful method to counter subjectivity. MBO involves setting objectives and targets mutually at the beginning of the performance period of a year and assessing whether they have been achieved at the end of the year. Setting standards of performance is implicit  in  the  objective  setting  to  ensure  quality  of performance.  The  challenge  in  this  system  is measurement.  Housekeepers  have  used  the  Trait

<!-- image -->

Method for non-management positions like the room attendant and houseman. The Trait Method evaluates certain behavioural characteristics like punctuality, attendance, teamwork, grooming, ability to follow instructions, etc. While some can be measured most others cannot and open the doors to subjectivity. The knowledge worker is soon acquiring the responsibilities of his supervisor, which means that MBO can be extended to non-management positions.

## Steps of MBO

The benefit of MBO is that deficiencies are not looked as areas for punishment but opportunities for training and development. The housekeeper is able to identify training skills needed. The system is futureoriented and gives a correct picture as to what potential an individual shows in terms of performance. It also binds the superior and subordinate to act as a team to achieve targets. The actual appraisal becomes transparent and both look upon performance as something that is mutually beneficial. The housekeeper should follow the steps below to enliven the MBO approach:

Step 1: Decide the performance year: Earlier organisations coincided the performance year with the financial year. While some organisations follow January to December as there financial year, others follow April to March. The financial year also builds in budgetary provisions for the ensuing year. The problem of aligning the performance year to the financial year is that appraisals are done much after the financial year and miss the annual budget to put in the recommendations for increments and bonuses. Organisations altered this situation by delinking the two periods. So if the budgeting year was April to May they made the performance year January to March giving ample time for recommendations and rewards to be factored into the next years budget. Earlier appraisals were used solely for the purpose of giving out increments and bonuses. Now organisations use it also as a powerful developmental tool, where weaknesses are looked upon as a training opportunity.

## 220

Step 2: Set standards of performance: Some standards are already fixed like cleaning 14 rooms in a shift or cleaning a departure room in 40 minutes. The housekeeper must always seek to measure performance. Measures dont lie and are accepted by both the assessor and assessee.

Step 3: Set objectives and targets with the subordinate at the beginning of the performance year. Objectives must be realistic and measurable and follow the SMART principle discussed in Lesson 1.3. Some objectives that can be set for a room attendant are:

- l Average rooms cleaned in a shift.
- l Lesser guest complaints
- l Repeat customers
- l Average time to prepare a room
- l Number of mistakes observed during inspections
- l New ideas introduced
- l Guest comment forms and feedback
- l Cost-control measures employed
- l Feedback of colleagues (360 degrees feedback)

Most important aspect of objective setting is that the employee must understand them and believe that they can be achieved. The housekeeper must listen to any doubts or apprehensions in achieving them. The objectives must be realistic and attainable.

Step 4: Review performance mid-year. An employee likes to know how s/he is doing. Feedback is a strong motivator and the employee has time to correct his/her performance if there are any weaknesses. Sometimes objectives will need to be altered as situations change. For example, an unplanned convention booked can introduce a set of new performance objectives.

Step 5 : Approach the system as a developmental tool. The housekeeper must be perceived as a mentor and coach. She must discuss weaknesses as opportunity for training. The employee may need inputs of knowledge, skills and attitudes which have different methodologies from the simple to the sophisticated. Such inputs become the individual development plan which dovetails into a larger departmental training and development plan.

Step 6: Conduct an appraisal interview in a relaxed atmosphere and with an open exchange of ideas. Earlier, appraisals were down behind the back of the employee. Employees did not get an opportunity to express themselves, and received surprises at the time of increments and rewards. This closed door system is obsolete. An employee must be given an opportunity to discuss his/ her performance jointly and plan a way to overcome weaknesses if any. The employee must be given enough time to prepare for an interview. The interview must be held in a quiet and relaxed place and the housekeeper must guard against any distractions. It is an important time for the employee and s/he must get the full respect that the occasion demands. Strictly concentrate on the individuals performance and not the personality, unless the personality is essential to service such as grooming and hygiene.

Give the subordinate an opportunity to explain himself or herself. Help the subordinate to identify deficiencies and chalk out action plans for improvement. Recognise and praise a job welldone. Show the subordinate the path for future growth. Encourage the employee to higher standards. Let the employee know the increment s/he will get for that performance and note

<!-- image -->

down any objections. Such objections can be discussed with the superior or the Human Resource Manager.

Step 7 : Document an individual development plan that is acceptable to the employee and receive a joint signature of agreement. Include the individual development plan in the Department Training and Development Plan that goes to the training department that will advise or organise appropriate training programmes.

Step 8: Send in writing the recommendations for rewards to the superior.

## 3.8 HOUSEKEEPING BUDGET

## Introduction

A budget is a formal financial statement of expenditure for a future period. It is a process of setting goals that are attainable and comparing them to the financial performance of a previous similar period. The key to successful budgeting is the planning process where long-term and short-term objectives are in place, supported by sound policies and procedures. A budget serves the following purposes:

- l It represents the desired rate of return required by the investors.
- l It establishes the cash flows required to achieve the targeted figures.
- l It gets people thinking of the future.
- l It sets goals against which performance can be measured.
- l It is a measure of success.
- l It sets parameters of expenditure that is acceptable to the business.
- l It enhances management control. This is achieved by comparing the actual expenses against the budgeted amounts.

A budget is a management tool and not an accounting tool. However, it uses the accounting process established for a business. An understanding of accounting reports is essential to prepare a budget. The person making the budget must know the components of a profit and loss statement and how it is presented. It differs from pure accounting only by noting predictions while accounting records actual facts. The housekeeping budget must cover a period that is controllable. Most hotels prepare an annual budget as a reasonable period for control.

The question arises why do we budget? Budgeting is a management control function and improves the process of control. A budget works on the basis that business plans go according to the schedule. Unfortunately, this is not always so. Plans are influenced by unanticipated factors internally or externally. An employee strike can affect plans just as much as a new sales tax can have an impact on plans and budgets. Plans must include remedial steps for the times when things go out of control. Budgets have to be altered accordingly. Sometimes plans have to be altered due to deficiencies thrown up in the budgeting process. For example, a plan may include room renovations for a set of rooms but the budget reveals that present cash flows cannot afford the renovation costs due to predicted business trends.

## Preparing a Budget

There are two types of budgets: the capital budget which is a statement of assets like linen, equipment, furniture, etc that will be used for a longer period; and the operating budget that lays down those anticipated expenses like guest supplies, cleaning supplies, etc. to do business on a daily basis. When preparing a budget there are certain rules to be followed:

- l The goals set by a budget must be attainable. Many investors have set unrealistic sales goals that demoralise the performing teams affected by it.
- l There should be wide participation in the budgeting process. An Executive Housekeeper who prepares the budget without involving the housekeeping team can set goals that the team is unable to attain. Participation of the team members gets their commitment to perform and achieve.

- l All  members  of  a  team  must  be  informed  of  the  approved  budget.  Many  Executive Housekeepers believe that they are the only ones privileged to see the budget and try to steer the team towards it when the team itself is in the dark as to what they are expected to achieve.
- l The budget must be completed before the performing  period.  Teams  cannot  be  held accountable for time that has elapsed.
- l We have seen that the budget is a measure of performance. Employees must know exactly what their role is in the attainment of the budget goals.
- l Employees given targets must have authority and control over their work process. They must be able to influence the amount that they are accountable for.
- l Budgets must be flexible to permit revisions for unanticipated changes.

## Revenue Forecasts

The first step in the budgeting process is determining the desired sales required. The revenue received is the yardstick on what can be spent. Revenue producing departments like food and beverage and the front office have to work hard for support departments like housekeeping and laundry to meet their budgetary requirements. The housekeeping budget reflects in the Rooms Division budget as housekeeping supports the sale of rooms. There are two possible ways of arriving at the desired sales figures.

## ROI (Return on Investment) Method

An investor normally sets a target of net profit based on the desired rate of return on an investment. So if he has invested $20 million in the hotel project he may say that he wants a 15% return on that investment each year. That figure translates into $ 3 million a year. This contribution comes from all revenue departments. The return on investment was set in year one by the investor. This figure increases year by year to factor in the present value of the investment. Sometimes the investor is reasonable and takes the product life-cycle into account. He may lower his return on investment in the introductory stage of the property but get more aggressive in the growth stages and then ease out at the mature and decline stage.

Working backwards (see fig. 3.12) the accountant will add the prevalent income tax percentage. He will then add fixed charges like depreciation, insurance and interest on loans taken. The budget would then arrive at the gross operating profit (GOP). The GOP reflects the efficiency of the operations in controlling expenditure. It represents the operating costs to run the business. Hotels consider a 30% GOP as healthy. Each department is concerned with GOP as a measure of their performance while the accountant will be concerned with figures relating to tax, insurance, interest and depreciation. After all, the costs to run the business are added on, like salaries and wages, heat, light and power, stationery costs, etc. to arrive at the gross profit. This may vary based on the unique circumstances of the hotel. If we add the cost of goods derived from a historical percentage of direct costs like guest amenities, raw food materials, etc, we arrive at the desired  sales  figure.  The  rooms  division  sees  its  contribution  to  sales  as  a  ratio  to  food  and beverage sales. In large hotels, a healthy ratio of room sales to food and beverage sales is 50:50, and then the room contribution is 50% of the total sales desired.

## 224

Putting the formula in a simple manner the budget would look like this:

Desired Net Profit (ROI)

Plus

Income tax @ 30% of income before tax

Income before Tax

Plus

Fixed Charges (depreciation, interest, insurance, rent)

Gross Operating Profit

Plus

Operating expenses @ 30%

Gross Profit

Plus

Cost of goods @ 10% of sales

Sales

Room contribution @ 50%

## Historical Method

Another way to arrive at desired sales figures is through an analysis of past performance. Normally the Front Office Manager increases the sales by a standard 10% from the previous year. This takes into account increases in operating costs and inflation. S/he knows the seasonal peaks and troughs and sets budgets month by month for the year. Obviously s/he is governed by two factors   occupancy  and  average  room  rate.  S/he  then  applies  a  simple  formula  for  each  month represented as:

Forecasted Room Revenues = Rooms available ¥ Occupancy percentage ¥ Average Room Rate

The hotel will ensure that most rooms are available for sale during season and take the advantage of the offseason for renovations and repairs. This is also influenced by the fact that the occupancies will be high in season and so the hotel will increase the average room rate to take advantage of the season. However, in the offseason the revenue targets will reduce as much as the occupancies and the average room rates. The hotel would like to exploit the seasonal business to the best.

The housekeeper will adapt her budget to the sales figures projected by the rooms division. She will look at her historical data of expenditure and perhaps use a rule of thumb of 10% to take into account the escalations in prices of supplies; increments and bonuses to staff; repair and maintenance costs; etc.

## Sources of Revenue

Rooms Division generates revenue from various sources:

- l Rooms are the biggest source of revenue. Rooms come in various types each with their own price range. The challenge is to maximize the yield from each room space.
- l Business Centre is a facility that most hotels nowadays are including in the list of facilities. Most hotels recognise the potential of revenue from the business sector and cannot overlook it. The business centre can be elementary with a secretary, office with computer and basic office  automation.  More  sophisticated  business  centres  can  have  meeting  rooms, teleconferencing  facilities,  multi-offices  and  the  latest  office  automation.  There  is  good potential for revenues from this facility.

- l Health Clubs are put under the charge of the rooms division. This facility promises good revenue with an increasing population of health conscious travellers. Health Clubs can again be simple with a swimming pool change rooms and sauna facilities. Bigger health clubs would have in addition a gymnasium, Jacuzzis, yoga rooms, meditation centres, massage parlor and perhaps a range of water sports, trekking facilities etc.
- l Miscellaneous Revenues can come from the sale of postage, safety deposit lockers, left luggage, additional services provided to the room like baby-sitting, extra beds, cribs, etc.

## Expense Forecasts

Before we venture into forecasting expenses let us understand the broad expense categories. There are four different categories of expenses:

- 1. Fixed expenses
- 2. Variable expenses
- 3. Discretionary expenses
- 4. Semi-variable expenses

Fixed expenses do not change with changes in volume. Such expenses are depreciation, interest payments and insurance.

Variable expenses change proportionately with changes in the volume of business. These are the cost of maintaining saleable rooms like cleaning supplies, guest amenities that are some of the direct expenses to a room sale. Other variable expenses are the operating expenses. To a rooms division manager operating expenses will include:

- l Salaries and wages: Salaries are those given to full-time employees while wages are given to part-timers and temporary workers. Based on the compensation package of the company, salaries are supported by perquisites like accommodation, transportation, medical insurance. Leave salary, leave tickets, pension contributions etc. All these have to be built in this expense head. The Human Resource Department that administers payroll and related expenses can assist in giving accurate figures.
- l Advertising and promotion expenses: While there are general advertising expenses for the entire hotel, there are some exclusive to the sale of rooms. Corporate advertisements are apportioned to revenue centres while room centre advertisements reflect directly in the budget. Promotions can be done from budgets for entertainment for the promotion of business with business sources or the hotel can launch a special promotion during lean months to stimulate room sales.
- l Stationery and supplies are those required for daily operations. Under this head are the printing expenses for forms and formats that drive operations. It would include computer accessories like CDs and printer ink.
- l Transportation is an important expense head. Expenses are incurred on two counts: one for operating courtesy transport for guests and the other to pick employees from their homes to be on duty. With the increasing prices of petrol, transportation becomes a rising expense.

## 226

- l Energy costs keep increasing year by year. The engineering department is able to apportion energy costs to all departments through a metering system. Energy cost would include power for running laundry equipment; heat and steam for laundry operations; central air conditioning or heat for guest rooms and offices; and lighting for all facilities.
- l Repair and maintenance costs are the usual costs for maintaining rooms. It does not include major renovation costs as they would be a separate capital investment. Maintenance would include consumables like bulbs, furniture and fixtures, office equipment etc.
- l Laundry expenses: These include the washing of linen, employee uniforms and guest clothes.
- l Duty meal expenses: though duty meals are prepared in bulk for all employees, the kitchen is able to allocate consumption to departments based on the number of employees in that department.
- l VIP amenities are those special items like bathrobes, bath slippers, vanity cases, full bar etc, that are provided to them They cost and have to be accounted for. They are reflected in the rooms division budget.
- l Guest supplies: These are consumable conveniences provided to guests in a guest room.
- l Cleaning supplies: These are all cleaning items of a consumable nature like detergents, sponges, cleaning cloths, etc.
- l Telecommunication expenses: The cost of external calls to suppliers and guests.
- l Contract charges: These charges are for hiring out-sourced suppliers of services like the laundry, carpet shampoo organizations, interior designer, etc.

Discretionary expenses are short term expenses to serve a specific purpose. Such expenses would include:

- l Major repairs
- l Complimentary meals for promotion
- l Special unplanned promotion expenses
- l Special VIP amenities

Semi-variable expenses are those that are partly fixed and partly variable. Incentive commissions to housekeeping staff are a good example. Housekeeping staff may get a fixed monthly salary as well as a bonus for meeting performance standards. For the purpose of budgeting, semi-variable expenses  are  clubbed  with  variable  expenses.  The  budget  can  be  graphically  represented  as shown on next page.

The rooms division manager will, therefore, plan his or her budget to include fixed expenses, variable expenses and sales. The front office budget will look like this:

## Budget Format

There is no rigid format for a budget. The budget must reflect the information that the management desires and can understand. It must be complete so as could be interpreted for any purposes of revenue and cost. Figure 3.12 gives a sample of a rooms division budget format.

<!-- image -->

## The Housekeeping Budget

As we have learnt, the housekeeping budget dovetails into the rooms division budget. Housekeeping is a cost centre and the housekeeper will have to tell the rooms division manager her costs to maintain the rooms. The housekeeping will typically have the following expense heads:

- 1. Salaries and Wages: This would perhaps be the largest expense of the housekeeping department. It includes the compensation to full-time employees, part-timers, daily wagers and apprentices. We all know that hotels provide benefits to employees. These benefits will reflect  under  this  head.  Benefits  include  house  rent  or  housing  costs;  uniforms  for housekeeping staff;  duty  meals;  health  insurance;  transportation;  leave  pay;  and  social welfare.
- 2. Cleaning supplies &amp; detergents: this could well be the next highest expense as the department is concerned with cleaning as its primary function. Cleaning supplies would include consumable items like buckets, mops, brushes, etc. Detergents include all the cleaning powders and solutions for various surfaces in the hotel. The laundry is the greatest consumer of detergents in view of the large volume of linen and uniforms that are laundered each day. Then there is the cost of laundering guest laundry which is factored into the price the hotel charges the guests with.
- 3. Guest amenities: This category includes all those items in guest rooms to be exclusively used by the guests. These include writing pens, soaps, vanity sets, drinking tumblers, guest hangers,  bathrobes,  bath  slippers,  and  special  supplies  to  VIPs  like  flowers  and  cakes. These costs may find its way to direct costs before gross profit.
- 4. Printing and Stationery Expenses: Stationery may be divided into what is required for housekeeping use such as forms and formats; and those used for guest use such as guest

Fig. 3.12 Rooms Division Budget Format

stationery, feedback forms, room service menus, tent cards used in rooms selling other facilities, etc.

- 5. Other  supplies: These  would  include  all  the  items  that  are  required  to  keep  the housekeeping running like seeds and manure for the gardens; flowers for floral arrangements throughout the hotel; maintenance of the nursery and green house; etc.
- 6. Energy: This is an item that is growing in cost everyday. The cost of power and steam is high.  Apart  from  the  electricity  consumed  by  the  housekeeping  direct  facilities  like  the linen/uniform room, control desk room, housekeepers office, etc. there is a huge cost of power to run the heavy laundry equipment. The laundry also needs steam to operate the steam presses.
- 7. Water: this is a large requirement for the housekeeping. They need water to service the external gardens; terrace gardens; indoor plants, floor pantries, etc. The largest consumer of water is the laundry for the cleaning of linen and uniforms.

<!-- image -->

- 8. Telecommunications: There is  an  expense for external calls to suppliers and guests. Sometimes the Information Technology department may apportion costs of web-based communications to the housekeeping department.
- 9. Advertising and Promotion: These costs may be apportioned to all revenue departments as the cost to get business. Media costs are expensive and need considerable allocations.
- 10. Repair and Maintenance costs: Housekeeping  needs  expenses  to  keep  the  rooms fresh and serviceable. These may include from cost of a bulb to the cost of renovating a room.
- 11. Contracts are the expenses incurred for hiring outsourced services like commercial laundries, interior designers, horticulture, etc.

The Executive Housekeeper is also concerned with the Capital Budget . The investor would have already provided for the large volumes of linen, uniforms, equipment, maids carts, etc. when the hotel was new. The housekeeper has to consider the replacement of these capital items on an annual basis due to normal wear and tear of operations. Items that fall in the capital budget would be:

- 1. Linen
- 2. Uniform materials
- 3. Housekeeping equipment: vacuum cleaners, floor scrubbers, carpet shampoo machines, washing machines, drycleaners, presses, sewing machines, etc.
- 4. Room renovations costs
- 5. Furniture: racks, cupboards, partitions, etc.

## 3.9 PURCHASING

## Purchase Specifications

An important role of any executive housekeeper is purchasing. She is part of a Purchase Committee consisting of the owner, the General Manager, the Financial Controller and the Purchase manager to buy capital items like linen, furniture, uniforms, carpets, and equipment. She is also responsible for entering into contracts with suppliers for daily supplies. The main considerations in purchasing are  quality,  quantity  and  price.  She  starts  with  a  market  survey  of  all  suppliers,  reference  to catalogues and research on the web, based on which she develops purchase specifications (fig. 3.13) for each item. These specifications are presented to the suppliers before orders are placed so that they can quote prices accordingly and the prices could be approved by the purchase committee.

To do otherwise would mean that the supplier is free to give any quality and price for a product. Purchasing by description is legally referred to as implied condition. Under the Sales of Goods Act, implied condition means goods will correspond with the description. However, if the specified product is sold under a patent or brand name, then there is no implied condition applicable. It is a major or essential term of the contract, a breach of which relieves the injured party from further duty to  perform if he so elects. Let us look at a typical test case of a product called vacuum cleaner and how a specification is interpreted:

Product Name: Vacuum Cleaner

Product Used for:

Vacuuming guest room carpets.

General Description:

Light and easily maneuverable.

Detailed Description: Vacuum Cleaner light weight with motor warranty; able to service 14 rooms in a shift; reclining model with durable extendable hose of 12 feet; vacuum bag detachable

The Purchase Department is responsible for all purchases for a hotel.

The goals of the purchasing department are to:

- l Buy the right product
- l Obtain the right quantity
- l Pay the right price
- l Deal with the right supplier

There are ethical concerns involved with any purchasing function because purchase managers are subject to several personal offers by suppliers to get their products accepted. The Purchase Manager should, therefore, be a man of honesty and integrity. He will invite tenders from suppliers based on Purchase Specifications supplied for all items. We must realise that an operation will be dealing with many suppliers, each a specialist in his field of product procurement e.g. linen, housekeeping equipment, laundry equipment, cleaning supplies, etc. The tenders are opened by the Purchase Committee which is faced with many important purchasing decisions concerning product, price, quality and suppliers.

## Product Considerations

- l Quality The committee ensures consistent quality by issuing Purchase Specifications that clearly defines the desired product standards. The housekeeping operations can suffer if the quality of equipment and tools are sub-standard.
- l Outsourcing This is an important decision as it involves investments of a long-term nature. For instance, the committee may decide whether to keep an in-house laundry or contract this function to a commercial city laundry. Such decisions are influenced by what is cheaper to the establishment. However, cost may not be the only criterion. The quality standards of the supplier or his ability to supply in time may also be a consideration. The

cost of having an in-house laundry is prohibitive because it means creating the space for these activities. Space has a cost as we have seen. Then an inhouse laundry also involves the investment in appropriate equipment and maintaining a brigade of laundry men and women which leads to incurring direct costs like salaries and indirect costs like uniforms, duty meals, transportation etc.

- l Capital Items These involve longterm investments. Items like equipment, linen, furniture and service ware incur a huge cost but are essential to the business. The committee ensures that such investments do not incur run away costs but bring in the best products available for the given price.
- l Daily Supplies Operational requirements like cleaning supplies are an essential part of business and important variable costs. Cleaning supplies come in many dimensions, each critical  to  operations. We have those supplies specifically for the laundry and those for guest rooms and public areas.
- l Sources of Supply A big decision is whether to buy items locally, from outstation or import them. While a local supplier is the cheapest, they may not be able to supply the quality. Many of them may not even stock some items. Some items may have to be imported at a great cost. The committee may decide whether to have those items or not in the first place. However, sometimes the committee may be forced to include them based on market research and the market segments, the establishment is catering to.
- l Warranties This may be the single most important point of negotiation. Warranties are introduced into contracts to provide for sub-standard products supplied. The replacements can either be done by the supplier himself or the establishment buys the replacement from the open market and presents the bill to the supplier. Purchase from the open market is a desperate measure when there is little time to replace items due to operational exigencies.

## Price Considerations

- l Price Negotiations This aspect is one of the main purposes of the committee to be taken up with the various suppliers. The attempt is to get the lowest price for the best quality. Most suppliers give volume discounts and the committee leverage volume as their main bargaining tool.
- l Purchasing Lower Quality Sometimes committees may deliberately take lower qualities because of price differentials between the lower quality and the next quality. A lower quality must not interfere with the quality of the end product. Such decisions are taken only when the quality is only marginally lower.
- l Necessity Many items like certain types of uniform material may be dropped from the operations  if  the  supplies  are  erratic  or  prohibitively  expensive.  The  committee  has  to balance whether the high costs of raw materials will justify sales.
- l Reduce Supplier Services Suppliers are expected to present items in special packaging to ensure longer shelf lives. The packaging is obviously built into the cost. Some establishments may do their own packaging and reduce their costs. They may ask the suppliers to present items in their exposed states. In another example, establishments may cut down the suppliers transportation cost by agreeing to pick-up items from the supplier warehouses.

## 234

- l Combine Orders Costs can be managed by clubbing several orders from a supplier so as to reduce the suppliers trips and therefore, the transportation costs.
- l Need for High Cost Items Committees may drop expensive items from the operations as a measure of containing costs.
- l Cash Payment Discounts Many establishments have enough cash flow to buy supplies outright. They can leverage this liquidity by taking advantage of trade discounts for payments in cash.
- l Speculation  of  Price  Trends In volatile  markets  in  which  demand  and  supply  is unpredictable, some establishments may stock extra items taking advantage of lower prices when there is a glut in the market. Hotels have advantage of storage space to stock quantities that  other  smaller  establishments  may  not  have.  They  then  have  items  at  lower  costs throughout the year.
- l Change Purchase Unit Size Sometimes changes in unit sizes to smaller ones can bring appreciable differences in price.
- l Innovation This is where an executive housekeeper can be of great contribution to cost control. If she can produce attractive landscapes with the local flora rather than buy expensive seeds and saplings she can effect great price savings.
- l Advantage of Supplier Promotional Discounts Sometimes suppliers offer special discounts to promote their products. A supplier could have a clearance sale to accommodate fresh stocks; or boost sales in a festive season; or sell old models at throw-away prices to accommodate new models; or close a show room; etc. The Purchase Committees must take advantage of such bargains. The Housekeeper and Purchase Manager must be alert to such events.
- l Contact Source Directly Some Purchase Committees may cut out middle-men and deal  with  the  source  suppliers  thereby  getting  wholesale  prices  rather  than  retail  ones. Housekeepers of independent hotels are known for going to the wholesale markets to get cheaper prices.  Some establishments may contact manufacturers directly for purchases to get the benefit of ex-farm prices.

## Quantity Considerations

- l Changing Prices The fluctuation in prices may alter consumption. Establishments may eliminate items that are not available.
- l Available Storage Facilities The amount of quantity procured also depends on how much storage facility is available to take certain volumes. The practice of Just-in-Time which has been so popular in the automobile industry in Japan is now coming to the service industry in which raw materials for the day are provided by the supplier directly for use eliminating storage. It will take time for the Just-in-time practice to be perfected in the hotel industry. The close collaboration between the establishment and the supplier is very essential for this pratice.
- l Storage &amp; Handling Costs The greater the volumes of supply, the greater are the costs of storage and handling. The costs of storage apply to the supplier as well as the hotel. Space, as discussed before is expensive nowadays and both the housekeeper and supplier

have to factor this into the cost of supply. The best is to determine economic order quantities for each item. An economic order quantity is a scientific formula that determines the exact quantities that gets the best price advantage for the hotel.

- l Waste &amp; Spoilage Concerns Long storage periods could result in items getting spoiled, unless properly handled. The expiry dates of packaged items could lapse in storage if large quantities are involved that cannot get closer controls. When dealing with large quantities there is invariably damage and loss in packaging, transportation, handling and storage.
- l Theft &amp; Pilferage Conditions Security of items in transit is another aspect that is a cost. Suppliers have to build in the cost of having security systems and personnel of their warehouses into the per item cost. Similarly hotels will have to build that cost into their overheads.
- l Market Conditions The market situation largely dictates the quantities that have to be purchased and stocked. Certain items are in surplus. Hotels can purchase those items on a daily  basis.  Suppliers,  too,  will  be  anxious  to  dump  excess  stocks  and  may offer heavy discounts. Others may be in short supply and need to be stocked for future use. Resorts may have their unique challenges. Some resorts may be in remote areas where the local market cannot sustain quantity purchases and variety. They may need to stock items unusually to meet business requirements.
- l Quantity Discounts As mentioned earlier under price considerations, establishments can obtain the price benefits for the large quantities they buy. Giving quantity discounts is an accepted practice among suppliers.
- l Minimum Order Requirement Imposed by Suppliers suppliers  may  impose  a minimum quantity for establishments to be eligible for discounts. Sometimes the minimum quantities  imposed  may  be  in  excess  to  the  requirements  of  the  establishment  making purchase committees to face decisions of purchasing lower quantities at higher prices or stocking large quantities that are not needed. Committees would have to do cost-benefit evaluation.
- l Transportation &amp; Delivery Costs With petrol and diesel costs increasing month by month, the cost of transportation is a critical factor. Committees will have to ascertain the ideal quantities to buy at one single time to justify the transportation cost. Sometimes the quantities bought may be in excess to the immediate needs.
- l Order Cost There are costs  of  paper  work,  telephone  use  and  wages  of  purchase personnel to bring about an order. These costs must be justified. Smaller restaurants may reduce these costs by getting the chef to do the daily marketing for his needs.

## Supplier Considerations

- l Supplier Location This factor influences the speed with which orders will be supplied and the transportation costs. Ideally, all establishments would prefer local suppliers to meet the above criteria. However, this is not always possible. Resorts in remote areas would need to depend on out-of-site suppliers. It depends on the quality of the establishment to make such a strategy. Even city establishments may depend on out-station suppliers for certain items and even imports from other countries.

## 236

- l Suppliers Facilities All food outlets would like to have reliable suppliers to meet their demands. Reliability is based on the suppliers facilities. An important part of decision making for a purchase committee is inspections of supplier facilities. The Purchase Committee would look at such factors as storage space, storage conditions, suppliers transportation facilities whether they are captive or out-sourced, evaluation of the suppliers sources of supply, etc.
- l Financial Stability The Purchase Committee would like to make sure that the supplier has adequate financial muscle to meet the demands of its clients. They can ask for suppliers bank statements and can get bank certificates of overdraft and loan facilities.
- l Technical Ability of Staff It is important to evaluate the qualifications and experience of the suppliers staff. As items get critical  like  wines,  crustaceans,  coffee  and tea blends, the  staff  must  be  knowledgeable  to  meet  the  clients requirements.

<!-- image -->

- l Honesty, Fairness &amp; Dependability The relationship with the supplier is a critical factor in any business. Suppliers can build or ruin a business. Unless raw materials are not supplied on time, production cannot take place. Institutions from the automobile industry in Japan have made suppliers as strategic partners and have even invested in them for them to support automobile manufacture. This principle can be applied here. The choice of the supplier is based on how he can become a strategic partner of the business with each one understanding the needs of the other. Issues of honesty can be dealt with by asking for references and making independent inquiry from other establishments. A dishonest supplier can ruin relationships and indeed, the business.

## Purchase Contract

The purchase contract is the legal document that finally cements the relationship between the chosen supplier and the establishment. The contract is made as clear as possible to avoid any misinterpretations and misunderstandings when the relationship is in place. Some common features of a purchase contract is given below:

- l Suppliers Name &amp; Location
- l Duration of contract
- l Delivery schedule
- l Transportation Clause
- l Product Specifications
- l Prices
- l Minimum quantity
- l Warranties &amp; Replacements clause
- l Non-delivery clause
- l Contact person &amp; numbers

The Purchase Committee will ask themselves the following questions:

- l How much of cash will be tied up in inventory?
- l Will cash flow be affected negatively?
- l Will the greater risk of theft warrant the purchase?
- l Will guests accept alternate brands?
- l How much of the taxes will be effected?

## 4.1 SUPERVISORY SKILLS

In Lesson 1.5 entitled, What is Management?, we have seen the role of the manager which reflects the role of the Executive Housekeeper. We have also seen the duties of the Executive Housekeeper in Lesson 3. The question arises whether supervisory skills are very different? The answer is, Most definitely, but somewhat related. Supervisors are the lowest rung of management but the critical link with the operational workers. Many organisations put them in an officer cadre which relies heavily on their technical skills but introduces them to human and conceptual skills. Most supervisors rise from the worker level, based on their technical achievements and potential for management. Figure 4.1 below gives an idea of the relationship of roles between managers and supervisors.

Fig. 4.1 Relationship of Roles

<!-- image -->

The diagram indicates three types of skills: conceptual, human and technical. These are common in varying degrees in all types of management and therein lies the relationship of supervision with management.

Conceptual skills: This relates to vision and ability to imagine and anticipate events and ideas. The top management has the major portion of this requirement for it is they who plan on a perspective and long term basis. They are expected to anticipate events and commit resources to meet them. Take, for example, renovation of rooms. The top management will visualise when it will happen, what funds will be required and the time by which it will be completed. Middle Management is given boundaries in which to conceive their operations and do annual planning. They can visualise till the extent of a year. The supervisors have to visualise too but on a weekly and daily basis. They should be able to anticipate events and emergencies on their daily routine and make tactical decisions to meet eventualities. Conceptualisation is not only to visualise but also comprehend. Top management are so qualified and experienced to comprehend a larger variety  of  subjects  and  issues  to  give  strategic  directions.  Middle  management  has  narrower spectrums  to  comprehend  based  on  their  experience  and  responsibilities.  Supervisors  must comprehend the instructions given to them by management.

Human Skills: This seems to be the largest chunk of skills required for both management and supervisors. To be a manager or supervisor means leading people to achieve given objectives. The supervisor is the first line of contact with the rest of the staff. S/he is the sandwich filling between the management and staff. The filling makes the sandwich meaningful! Besides this a supervisor has a number of other people to deal with on a daily basis. Figure 4.2 below gives an illustration of the people with whom a supervisor has to interact:

Fig. 4.2 The Supervisory Interface

<!-- image -->

We see in the diagram above, that the supervisor has many interfaces. The floor supervisor, for example, is subordinate to management and receives objectives and instructions. Her relationship with her boss is critical. She has to have trusting relationship where she can clarify doubts or seek

help freely. She bears the burden of the superiors expectations that all duties and responsibilities will  be  carried  to  standards.  The  supervisor  leads  and  motivates  her  team  (see  Lesson  3.6 Leadership and Motivation for more details). The team expects the supervisor to lead from the front and make tactical decisions at the operational level. The team also expects the leader to understand their individual competencies and skills and to put them together towards contributing to the team. They also want him or her to understand their limitations and problems and be a problem solver to help them through their handicaps. The supervisor deals with guests in handling complaints and needs and translating them into action. This requires guest handling skills (see the part, Understanding Guest Service in  Introduction for more details). Finally the supervisor deals with other departments and brings to the team their cooperation and coordination for the success of the operation. We know by now that housekeeping coordinates with maintenance, laundry, stores, and the front office on a daily basis. Periodically, they coordinate with other departments as well.

Technical Skills: Supervisors are expected to have the technical skills better than the team members. Workers like the comfort of going to the supervisor to resolve technical problems. Team members expect the supervisor to train and coach them on the job on various aspects of the job, as well as translate management policies, procedures and standards at the work place.

## Supervisory Competencies

While the generic skills of a supervisor are given above, it is important to identify those specific skills and competencies that make him succeed:

Communicators: The supervisors are expected to communicate well both orally and in writing. This  is  because  they  are  constantly  interacting  with  management,  workers,  guests  and  other departments. They have to be persuasive yet empathetic and be good listeners. Supervisors are required to generate several reports at the operational level for management to make decisions. They are also required to give verbal feedback to the management. At the same time, they are required to communicate management policies, plans, and standards in a manner that is easily understood at the worker level.

Problem Solvers and Decision makers: Supervisors are expected to solve problems at the operational level. They are hired to do exactly that and not let the operational issues bog the management down. This requires them to make tactical decisions within their boundaries of authority. This also requires them to achieve objectives with given resources which are always in short supply.

Leaders: Supervisors are expected to lead. This means taking full responsibility of actions taken at the ground level. They are expected to be enthusiastic and encourage the team to achieve results in spite of heavy odds. They must see their team members as individuals with their talents and handicaps. They must improve on talents and help overcome handicaps. Team building is an important aspect of the supervisor who is expected to gel the varied talents and personalities as a cohesive whole. Workers expect the supervisor to be their friend, philosopher and guide and reliable to keep their confidences.

SelfDisciplined: Workers look to the supervisor as a role model. This is a big expectation, which can only be fulfilled by being self-disciplined. Discipline for a  supervisor translates as being on time for duty; well-groomed; respecting seniors; following instructions; meeting deadlines; not

<!-- image -->

shirking responsibilities; being polite and courteous; putting management before self; following rules and regulations; following standards; and leading from the front.

Continuous improvement: Supervisors sometimes fall into the trap that they know it all. A good supervisor will continuously upgrade herself through self learning and see ways to bring the new knowledge into the workplace. They will encourage their team also to give feedback on how things can be done better. Management value suggestions for improvement from the grass root levels as well.

## 4.2 THE FLOOR LINEN ROOM

## The Floor Pantry

The floor linen room (also called the floor pantry) is a store that stocks linen and supplies for a given floor. It is normally situated away from the guest view such as the elevator landing or the end of a floor. The room should be a cool and dry place away from steam pipes and dust.

## Furniture &amp; Fixtures

The floor linen room has the following furniture and fixtures:

- 1. Cupboard for guest and cleaning supplies, blankets, pillows and mattress protectors.
- 2. Shelves for linen. These can be wooden shelves or mobile ones as shown alongside.
- 3. Shelves  for  used  newspapers  and  magazines,  used  bottles  and vacuum cleaners.
- 4. Janitors closet for cleaning equipment with long handles such as mops and also waste baskets, buckets etc.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 5. Wooden or canvas lined hampers for soiled linen received from various maid carts on the floor, before the linen is sent to the laundry. The hampers can be fixed or mobile (as shown in the picture) for easy transportation to the laundry.
- 6. Space for maid carts, baby cots and roll-away beds.
- 7. Sinks for flower arrangements and disinfecting tumblers.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Storage Tips

- 1. Brushes must not rest on bristles.
- 2. Cleaning sprays must be away from hot areas.
- 3. Dusters must be dried before storing.
- 4. Buckets must be emptied of all water and dried before storing.
- 5. Polishes must be properly sealed to prevent drying.
- 6. At the end of the shift, all used magazines, newspapers and empty bottles are sent to the garbage disposal area where independent bins for each are allocated. These items are recycled by agencies.
- 7. Used candles and soaps are deposited at the Control Desk for reuse in offices, staff locker rooms, etc.
- 8. Garbage is examined by the Floor Supervisor for any lost and found articles before sending it to the garbage disposal areas.

## Basic Principles

The floor linen room should be kept locked at all times as expensive assets like linen, guest supplies,  etc.  are  stored  here.  The  Floor  Supervisor  is  the  only  one  with  the  key  and  is  the custodian of all the assets in the room. The room should be clean at all times especially when the staff is off duty.

## Procedure for Requisitioning Fresh Linen

- 1. Soiled linen is sorted at the pantry according to types, counted and recorded in the Room Linen Control Sheet (Fig. 4.3) by the Floor Supervisor.

## Procedure for Requisitioning Guest and Cleaning Supplies

Basic principles:

- (a) Each floor pantry is given a par stock for each item of supplies.
- (b) The moment the supplies at the floor pantry falls below the par stock the Floor Supervisor prepares a Weekly Stores List (Fig. 4.4). The columns marked consumed and required

are a control measure to ensure that what is requisitioned is not more than what is consumed. The column received gives quantities actually issued by the stores. This is particularly useful when what is issued is less due to shortage of stock so that future claims can take this into account.

- (c) Requisitioning must be done strictly against consumption.
- (d) Requisitioning is done on a weekly basis.
- (e) Weekly Stores List must be prepared and presented on that day every week which is allotted to the floor for the issue of supplies.

## Procedure

- (a) Once the floor supervisor completes the Weekly Stores List, she forwards it to the Executive Housekeeper for approval.
- (b) The Executive Housekeeper thoroughly scrutinizes the Weekly Stores List to see that no item is over ordered. This is where she can exercise cost control as each item requisitioned costs and will be charged to the Housekeeping Department. She signs the Weekly Stores List in approval.
- (c) She hands the List to the Desk Control Attendant who fills a Stores Requisition Form (Fig. 4.5) in duplicate. The original is meant for the store while the copy remains in the Requisition Forms Book for record.

| Units Required Bin Card No. | Units Required Bin Card No. | Units Required Bin Card No. | Units Required Bin Card No. | Units Required Bin Card No. |

- (d) The Executive Housekeeper signs all the Store Requisition Forms.
- (e) The Floor Supervisor designates someone from her floor on requisitioning duties. It can be a room attendant or houseman.
- (f) The items are requisitioned from the General Store on a given day and time in the week for such requisitions.
- (g) The floor representative and storekeeper confirm that the items tally with the Requisition form and both sign in acknowledgement. Sometimes the General Store may not have some items in stock and will mention it in the store for claiming when those items are available.

## 246

- (h) The supplies are brought to the floor pantry and the floor supervisor checks the items against the Weekly stores List.
- (i) Weekly Stores Lists are presented at the end of each month to the Executive Housekeeper for control and future planning.

## Records kept in a Floor Linen Room

- 1. Spring Cleaning Register for preventive cleaning cycles of rooms in a month.
- 2. Floor Log Book which records:
- (a) The duty roster for the floor
- (b) List of outstanding maintenances to be followed up in the next shift.
- (c) Record of rooms cleared at night and departure rooms.
- (d) Important messages for the next shift supervisor.
- 3. Guest Supplies Control Register (Fig. 4.6)to keep control of guest supplies used in rooms. The consumption pattern helps the housekeeper with future budgeting.
- 4. Linen Control Book records the movement of linen on a daily basis to and from floors.
- 5. Weekly Stores List File for record of consumption and requisitioning of cleaning/ guest supplies from stores.

## 4.3 PREPARING A ROOM REPORT

## Introduction

The Housekeeping Room Report (Fig. 4.7) is a document that confirms the occupancy of rooms in a given shift. Since the Floor Supervisor has access to guest rooms on her allotted floor, she is the best person to confirm physically the occupancy status of rooms. She performs this task to enable the front office to tally her findings with their room rack, which lists the name of guests by room number. Should their be a discrepancy between her findings and the front office room rack, the front office agent sends a bell boy to make another physical verification to confirm the room status. The front office requires this information to ensure that they are accurately billing the guests and that there is no loss of revenue. This procedure is followed in each shift.

## Room Report

The Floor Supervisor prepares the Housekeeping Room Report in triplicate. The original is meant for the front office, the duplicate for the auditor who calculates expected revenues, and the triplicate for the housekeeping record. The Floor Supervisor may delegate this task to a room attendant. She then sends the report to the Housekeeping Control Desk Supervisor who prepares a consolidated list of all the floors. She sends it to the front office receptionist who tallies the consolidated report with the room rack. This procedure is followed as a check on unauthorised room occupancies or inadvertent mistakes in recording room occupancies.

The Housekeeping Room Report is basically a list of room numbers against which the Floor Supervisor indicates the occupancy status by prescribed occupancy codes (fig. 4.8). The codes may vary from hotel to hotel but the basic information and intention is the same. The Floor Supervisor physically enters each room on the floor with her master key following the entry procedure of knocking the door and announcing Housekeeping. This she does again after an interval of thirty seconds to give time to the occupant to open the door. Once in the room she ascertains the number of guests by three methods: 1) by noticing the number of beds used; 2) by seeing the number of bath towels used; and 3) by observing the types of guest clothes hung in the wardrobe. The first check normally confirms the occupancy. She will obviously not enter rooms with a Do-not-Disturb sign.

An explanation of the codes will be useful here:

Occupied: This is a status that shows that a guest has checked into the room and is staying in the hotel. The signs of occupancy are beds that have been used, baggage on the baggage rack, clothes in the wardrobe, room service trays not cleared, bath towels that have been used and personal effects lying in the room and bathroom.

Vacant: This is evident when a room is ready for sale and has no guest belongings.

DND: This is a sign displayed either by a door knob card or a lit DND light beside the door. Obviously the guest cannot be disturbed.

Luggage in Room but not Used: This code may seem odd. There are guests who may lease a room but stay with friends and relatives in the city. The luggage is not opened. The danger of such a status is that the guest may have skipped without paying the room bill but leaving the baggage behind as a decoy.

Under Repair: This code indicates that the room been declared unsuitable for occupancy till the maintenance has corrected the fault in the room. This is a temporary situation where the room can be released in a short time.

Occupied, but no Luggage: These rooms show that the beds and bath linen have been used in spite of no guest luggage; there are several possibilities in such rooms: (1) it is a departure

room; (2) the night manager may have used the room to rest; (3) staff may have used the room without permission; 4) a guest with light luggage may have checked out with or without paying the bill.

Scanty Baggage: This is a status of a room with light luggage. This can be a potential skipper or a person who may depart without paying the bill.

Out-of-Order: This  is  a  status  that  places  a  room  for  a  longer  period  of  maintenance  and therefore, cannot be expected to be on sale.

Double Lock: A hotel provides a double locking facility to guests as a security measure. The Floor Supervisors master key may not be able to open a door with a double lock. Sometimes the guest may have put the security chain from the inside which certainly indicates occupancy but not the number of people within.

Not Cleared: This is a code to indicate a departure room declared as such by the control desk.

## 4.4 OTHER DUTIES

## Introduction

In addition to routine functions as explained earlier, the floor supervisor has other periodic duties to accomplish. This may be done once a week, monthly or biannually. Such duties are:

## Weekly Cleaning Procedure

The Floor Supervisor rotates room attendants and housemen to accomplish certain cleaning chores that are time-consuming and labor intensive to be done by the same person on a daily basis. The Supervisor may assign a room attendant and a houseman for tasks beyond the physical capacity of one person. Such activities are:

- 1. Polishing brassware in rooms.
- 2. Scrubbing bathroom tiles that have stubborn stains.

<!-- image -->

- 3. Pest control.
- 4. Unhooking translucent day curtains that may gather dust over time and sending them for laundering. The curtains brought down will require a replacement to be hooked on.
- 5. Scrubbing shower curtains that have stubborn stains.
- 6. Cleaning window panes. A special crew will clean window panes from outside on a bi-annual or annual basis.
- 7. Scrubbing balconies and terraces.
- 8. Vacuuming carpets under heavy furniture.
- 9. Changing paper under liners in guest closets and drawers.
- 10. Cycling potted plants with those in the nursery.
- 11. Grouting bathroom tiles.

## Under-Repair Rooms

The Executive Housekeeper may stipulate a preventive maintenance cycle for all rooms or the Maintenance Department may take a room or set of rooms for a major maintenance work such as painting, masonry work, etc. In such cases, the Floor Supervisor follows certain procedures as follows:

- 1. Inform the Housekeeping Control Desk to advice front office not to sell rooms taken under major repair.
- 2. Call the tailor from the linen room to dismantle the curtains and send them for storage in the linen room.
- 3. Send lamp shades, bed covers, skirting, linen, guest supplies, etc. to the floor linen room for storage.
- 4. Cover the telephone instrument/s with polythene and disconnect it.
- 5. Close inlet valves of taps and water closets.
- 6. Call  the  audio-visual  technician  to  disconnect  the  televisions/radios/ music systems and store them in the music room.

## LESSON  4 Duties of a Floor Supervisor

- 7. Send upholstered furniture to the upholstery yard for mending or cleaning with shampoo.
- 8. Call the horticulturist to collect indoor plants for storage in the nursery.
- 9. Remove all dresser and wardrobe drawers and store them in the floor linen room.
- 10. Roll up carpets and send them to the upholstery yard for shampooing.
- 11. Cover remaining furniture and fixtures with polythene sheets or condemned bed sheets.

Note: All  items  must  be  labelled  with  the  room  number  for  identification  when  it  is  time  to replace them.

## Guest Loan Items

The Floor Supervisor will periodically loan items to guests on request, as the extra service provided by the hotel. Some hotels may charge for these items. Such items are:

- l Hand Iron
- l Hair dryer
- l Ironing board
- l Cribs
- l Sewing kits
- l Rollaway beds
- l Voltage adaptors
- l Hot water bottles
- l Extra pillows
- l Orthopedic mattress
- l Extra blankets
- l Vanity sets

These items need to be controlled carefully as they cost and the supervisor will be held accountable for them. Each floor supervisor is issued a number of these items which are stored in the floor linen room. The amounts are based on historical demand for these items which then becomes the par stock of each item. The hazards associated with loaning these items are:

- l Theft
- l Damage
- l Misplaced
- l Misuse

The floor supervisor will maintain a Guest Loan Register (Fig. 4.9) given below:

Fig. 4.9 Guest Loan Register

| Date   | Room No.   | Name of Guest   | Call time   | Delivery time   | Recovery time   | Person receiving request   | Person     | Comments   |
|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|------------|------------|
|        |            |                 |             |                 |                 |                            | recovering |            |

<!-- image -->

The supervisor shall control the movement of these items and ensure that they are recovered before she ends her shift. Should the guest wish to retain the item beyond the shift, the supervisor must mention this in the log book for the next shift supervisor to follow-up. It is quite possible that the person receiving the request and the one recovering the item are two different people. The control features are the date, name of the guest and room number. The call and delivery times are there  to  ascertain  how  promptly  the  guest  request  was  serviced.  The  persons  receiving  and recovering the items are held responsible for the safe return of the item to the floor linen room. The last column Comments gives the status of the item. If damaged, the floor supervisor can advise the control desk who may charge the damage to the guest folio. For hotels who charge for this service, the delivery time and recovery time can inform the front office cashier how much to charge to the guest folio. Some hotels charge by the hour and some have a fixed charge. When charging for this service, it is important to maintain a close coordination with the Control Desk who will advise the Front Office Cashier of such charges.

## Inventory of Guest Supplies

Another important concern for a floor supervisor is the control of guest supplies. Every guest room has a standard number of items and therefore, it is easy to calculate the demand for such items on a daily basis. The list below gives the standard guest supplies in a luxury hotel:

## Room

- l 12 letterheads and 6 envelopes
- l 2 postcards usually of the hotel or the city landmarks
- l Folders for stationery
- l Sewing kit
- l Notepad and ball pen at the telephone
- l Bible/Koran/Gita (provided free by religious associations)
- l Telephone directories (provided free by the telephone department)
- l 2 ashtrays (in smoking-rooms) one on the coffee table and the other in the bathroom.
- l Bathrobe
- l Bath slippers
- l Shoe-shine place mat
- l Room Service Menu
- l Candle stand with candles and matches
- l Guest comment card
- l Do-not-Disturb Cards
- l TV listings (provided free by television companies)
- l Breakfast door knob card
- l 6 Hangers per person

## Bathroom

- l Shoe mits
- l 2 cakes of soap (one for bath and the other for hand wash)
- l Hair-dryer

## LESSON  4 Duties of a Floor Supervisor

- l Razor dispenser
- l 2 sanitary bags
- l Vanity set (shampoo, bath foam, hand lotion, moisturizer, toothpaste, disposable tooth brush, disposable razor, shaving cream and a hair brush). These are take-away items that need replacement for each departure room)
- l Shower cap
- l 2 glass tumblers per guest

If these are the standard supplies in a guest room, the variable element is occupancy and the change over of rooms to new arrivals. The Supervisor will need to establish a par stock of each

item based on historical data of consumption. The par stock may vary by season. Peak seasons will need a higher par stocks while low seasons will need less. The Supervisor may realise that some items like ashtrays, room service menus, do-not-disturb signs, directories, etc have a longer room life than other consumables. She must maintain appropriate par stocks in the floor linen room and a par on each maid cart. She would know exactly the consumption of each cart on a daily basis. She maintains these records in a Guest Supplies Consumption Register (Fig. 4.10).

The Floor Supervisor will make the necessary requisitions from the general stores after the necessary approval of the Executive Housekeeper.

## Duties of a Room Attendant

## 5.1 LAYOUT OF A GUEST ROOM AND GUEST AMENITIES

## Introduction

A room attendant must be thoroughly familiar with a guest room. The reason why she is employed is because she has to clean guest rooms in her shift. This is her sole purpose and it is natural that

she should know the product. Guest rooms represent the major revenue  generating  source  for  the  hotel.  It  contributes  a minimum 50% to total hotel revenues and in some cases, becomes the only revenue source if they have none or limited food and beverage operations. A hotels purpose, since the early  inns,  is  to  provide  accommodation  to  travellers,  as  a home away from home. Investors put in a great deal of money into creating rooms. The common belief is that the more  rooms  they  provide,  the  better  it  is  for  business economics. It is for this reason that we find hotels that have

<!-- image -->

reached over 5000 rooms. The future only indicates mega hotels with thousands of rooms.

## Types of Rooms

We have seen in Lesson 1.4 entitled Types of Rooms, the different types of rooms created in hotels and available to the traveller. The most sensible type of rooms are the twin rooms (having

<!-- image -->

two single beds), because they can be used as single, double or triple rooms. Other hotels have preferred to provide a queensized double bed (as shown in the picture above) that can be used as single beds as well as double. It, however, does not give the flexibility to be used for two unrelated travellers. When groups travel, luxury hotels at times provide two queen-sized beds to make each persons stay comfortable (as shown in the picture alongside). We find hotels in Las Vegas in this category.

## 256

Then we have the suites which is a composite of two rooms, one acting as a livingcumdining room while the other the bedroom. Residential suites will also provide kitchenettes (as shown below).

<!-- image -->

The Room Attendant will possibly have a few suites in her charge to clean along with twin or double room. This brings with it the complexities of cleaning and productivity.

While referring to the schematic diagram in the next page (not drawn to scale but representative only), a typical room will have a bed or beds that have 1 to 4 mattresses depending on the type of luxury the hotel wishes to provide. The mattresses are separate from the cot which is mounted on wheels. This gives the room attendant flexibility to move the bed around (as shown below), especially when preparing it and cleaning beneath it. It is prudent to fix the headboard to the wall

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

enabling the room attendant to reach the head side of the bed as well as the headboard for cleaning purposes. The owner of the hotel can change the headboard during major renovations without having to change the bed.

<!-- image -->

The next feature is the bedside table . It has a table lamp for reading; a bedside telephone; a shelf which has a copy of Bible, Koran or Gita and the telephone directories; and other features like alarms and clocks. The bedside table becomes a console when electrical connections of the room come to it to control all the lights in the room and the power of the television set. However, modern technology has provided electronic remote controls doing away with electrical connection to the console, leaving this piece of furniture as bedside tables only.

<!-- image -->

It is important at this stage to be familiar with the lighting system in a typical room. The room will have an entrance light in the passage as one enters the room; two table lamps on either side of the bed, they can be wall or headboard mounted behind the bed; one standing lamp at the corner of the room; mirror light for the dresser; wall mounted lights especially in large rooms and suites; and floor night lamps for those who do not like to sleep in the dark.

The standard bulb power for bedside tables is 60 watts while for the standard lamp and dresser light, has 100 watts. Bathrooms have a neon mirror light and a ceiling spot light with a normal bulb.

<!-- image -->

The next piece of furniture is the luggage rack. The luggage rack comes in two types. The fixed wooden feature that have brass strips (see picture) so as not to damage the wood and the other is the foldable one that can be stored in the wardrobe when not in use. The wooden rack is sturdier  and  preferred  by  hotels  that  have  international  travellers  with  heavy  baggage.  The housekeeping can keep a few foldable ones in the floor linen room if a guest requires them for additional storage.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The wardrobe is furniture usually found at the entrance passageway (see schematic layout). The wardrobe is the prime storage space in the room for guest belongings and additional blankets and pillows. It would have a section to hang long clothes like dresses and gowns; shelves for extra pillows and blankets and drawers for clothing accessories. Most hotels that provide room safety boxes have them installed in the wardrobe for additional security. The wardrobe normally has a full length mirror for guests to use just as they leave the room. The guest will find the following amenities inside the wardrobe: laundry lists; bath slippers; shoeshine tag; hangers; bathrobe; extra pillows and blankets. Some wardrobes have internal lighting to see clearly the articles in the cupboard.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The dresser is a multi-purpose piece of furniture. It has a base that acts as a dresser as well as the writing desk. Above it is mounted a mirror. The dresser has drawers where the guest will find guest stationery and sewing kits. On the top, the dresser will display menu cards, guest comment forms and other internal advertisement material.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The room gets complete with a coffee table and two chairs . This is where magazines are displayed and where the guest can eat his meals ordered from the room service. It is the place where the guest can seat his/her visitors.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

We cannot overlook the fact that many hotels have balconies, terrace gardens and patios. They may provide garden furniture for these areas that can resist external temperatures. A room attendant will have to maintain them as well. Chalet type of structures may provide verandas that will have seating appropriate for outdoor purposes. With this feature, guests may want to eat their room service meals outdoors and enjoy the views and ambience that is provided.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Bathroom

The room attendant has to be familiar with the bathroom as it is an intimate part of a guest room. The bathroom will normally be found off the entrance passageway. A typical bathroom of a luxury hotel will have a bath tub with a shower curtain; counter where the sink is mounted that serves the place to display vanity sets, guest toiletries, merchandising material and perhaps, a flower arrangement; a water closet; and rods for bath towels, face towels and hand towels.  Deluxe hotels may provide shower trays as well while economy hotels will do away with bath tubs due to space  restrictions  and  provide  shower  trays  instead.  Some  budget  hotels  may  just  provide  a

shower with a shower curtain. At this point, it is important for the room attendant to know the difference in terms for bathing: a bath is when a bath tub is provided; a shower tray facility is when an enclosed cubicle is provided for showers; and a shower is an alcove where a person bathes with shower from a shower fountain.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

This completes the guest room. It is a composite of a bedroom and bathroom with perhaps a balcony, patio, terrace or veranda based on the design of the property. All this, then becomes the responsibility of the room attendant multiplied several times over, in a shift.

## 5.2 RULES ON A GUEST FLOOR

## Rules for the Floor Attendant

Prior to commencing work on the floor, all housekeeping staff, especially room attendants, must follow some floor rules that lend an air of efficiency and least inconvenience to guests. The floor and rooms are most private and personal to the guests who are concerned about the people who frequent them. They place a large trust in the management of the hotel through the room attendants who are privy to their rooms and belongings. The room attendant is issued the master keys by the Desk Control Supervisor. She signs for this facility and therefore, becomes responsible for its safekeeping. It also signifies that trust has been placed in her by both the management and guest to access guest floors and rooms. To uphold this trust, the following rules must be strictly observed on the floor:

- 1. Always be in uniform and properly groomed when entering the floor. The moment a room attendant enters the floor, she reflects the image of the property. It is punishable for room attendants to be out of uniform when on duty.
- 2. Always reach the floor  by  the  service  elevator  and  enter  the  floor  through  the  service entrance. The guest elevators are meant for the guests only.
- 3. Conversations among the floor staff must be restricted to a minimum. In case communication is necessary, this must be done in low tones even when guests are not in sight.
- 4. Unnecessary  movements  like  running  or jumping must be avoided. Such movements can disturb guests in the room.
- 5. The passageway must be kept free of equipment, trays or trolleys.
- 6. Room attendants may enter only those rooms that  are  allotted  to  them.  They  are  not permitted to enter other rooms as a precaution towards security and accountability.
- 7. Guest room doors must be kept wide open when the  room  is  being  attended  to.  This notifies the supervisor as to which room is being cleaned and where to reach the room attendant. It is also a protection to the room attendant from undesirable guests.

<!-- image -->

- 8. When speaking to a guest in the room for any reason, do so while standing at the doorway and not inside the room which becomes an infringement of the guests privacy.
- 9. The floor telephone must be attended to promptly. Continuous ringing of a phone can be irksome to guests in neighboring rooms.
- 10. Room attendants must greet all guests with a smile, according to the time of the day. It is a professional courtesy and creates a friendly environment on the floor.
- 11. Staff  must  be  helpful  and  should  readily  give  information,  about  hotel  services,  when requested. Misleading a guest through misinformation can lead to guest dissatisfaction.

| 12.     | Alertness to guest movements is necessary so as to report anybody suspicious to the floor supervisor and ultimately, the security.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 13. 14. | Remember that the guest is always right. Arguing with a guest is prohibited. If a guest is being unreasonable, refer him/her to the floor supervisor. It is prohibited to enter rooms with a Do-not-Disturb sign. The DND feature is provided                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If a DND sign is on for a long time, this may be reported to the Floor Supervisor who will                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15.     | take further decisions and actions. Long DND signs especially those that span over two shifts are unusual. A guest could be sick and in need of medical help. There have been cases of death in the past in such a situation.                                                                                          |
| 17.     | In  spite  of  following  the  room  entry  procedure,  if  the  guest  is  found  asleep  or  awake, apologize and quickly withdraw and shut the door softly. Sometimes the room attendant may hear the sound of the shower in the bathroom indicating the reason for the guest not                                   |
| 18.     | attending to the door knock. Always follow the procedure of entering a room even if the room is declared vacant. The procedure includes knocking the door and announcing Housekeeping to be repeated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 19.     | Always accompany the room service staff, when they are clearing trays and maintenance staff for repairs, when they enter the room. We have understood that the room attendant is the custodian of the rooms allotted to her and that she will be held accountable for any missing guest or hotel property in the room. |
| 20.     | Do not open the room to any unauthorised personnel. Resident guests are expected to have their own keys. Other guests should not enter at any cost.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21.     | It is important to report any suspicious articles like arms and drugs to the Floor Supervisor who may call the security for further inspection.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 22.     | Housekeeping personnel cannot make external calls from guest rooms. External calls are only permitted from floor telephones as an exception only after receiving the permission from the Floor Supervisor.                                                                                                             |

| 25.     | a control measure. While this may not always be possible, it is a good practice. Dump garbage and soiled linen in the designated hampers of the maid cart. Such items must be away from guest view.                                                                                                                    |
| 26.     | Caution guests of wet floors in the corridors (if uncarpeted) or in the room. The correct practice is to put Wet Floor signs as a precaution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

- 27. Guest belongings found in departure rooms should immediately be reported to the Floor Supervisor. She will check if the guests have checked out or are still paying their bills with the Front Office Cashier. If the guests have checked out then the Floor Supervisor will follow the lost and found procedure.
- 28. The room attendant must return the master key to the Desk Control Supervisor at the end of the shift.

It  must be understood that the room attendant is the custodian of the floor and rooms are allotted to her. She is accountable for any missing items or incidents in that area. She becomes the doorkeeper of that floor section and must be passionate about her area of responsibility.

## 5.3 THE MAID CART

## Introduction

The maid cart is a trolley meant to stock a given number of linen, supplies and equipment to service an allotted number of rooms. Each maid, after receiving her room assignment, should check her supplies against a standard checklist to avoid needless trips. The maid is responsible for the condition, cleanliness and appearance of her cart.

<!-- image -->

## Arrangement of Articles

The lower shelf of the cart is used to carry heavier items like mattress protectors, bed sheets and night spreads. The middle and top shelf stock pillow slips and bath linen. Linen will include:

| Linen Items   | Stocking standard   | Standard Dimensions   |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Night spreads | 1 per bed           | 24  ¥  108                       |

These supplies are procured by the room attendant from the floor linen room. After stocking the cart, the room attendant proceeds to the section of rooms on the floor that are assigned to her. Maid carts are placed along the corridor wall on the side of the room being serviced. The cart should be so positioned as to service a minimum of two rooms without much movement of the room attendant to minimize trips to the cart and thereby reduce the fatigue factor.

## Consideration for Selection of a Maid Cart

When selecting maid carts, consideration is given to it being lightweight to ensure easy mobility by the maid. Heavy carts also crumple corridor carpets. The wheels of the cart must be of sturdy

construction and should be oiled well periodically to ensure smooth movement. The diagram below, gives some of the considerations shown by designers to make the room attendants job easier.

## 5.4 CLEANING A ROOM

## Room Cleaning Procedures

Prior to reporting on a floor, the room attendant already knows the status of the rooms assigned to her on the floor. This is given to her at the time of briefing by the Floor Supervisor. The room attendant can prioritise the rooms according to occupancy. She would attend to departure rooms first to prepare them for sale. She would next attend to those rooms with the tag Clean my Room left by resident guests when they leave the room for the day. She would attend to occupied rooms in the last. She would avoid rooms with a Do-not-Disturb sign displayed. Given below is a step-by-step procedure for cleaning a room:

## Entering the Room

- 1. Knock the door announcing Housekeeping.
- 2. If  there is no answer, after fifteen seconds knock the door the second time announcing Housekeeping.
- 3. If there still no answer use the master key to open the door announcing Housekeeping and knocking the door when ajar. When relatively sure that there is no occupant, open the door wide.
- 4. Switch off the room airconditioner or heating. Draw all curtains and open all windows to air the room.

## Guest belonging Check

<!-- image -->

- 1. Check departure rooms for lost and found items and report it immediately to the control desk.
- 2. Pick guest clothes and hang them in the wardrobe in occupied rooms.
- 3. Empty all ash trays into a waste paper basket in the room. Collect other loose trash on tables and floors and throw them in the waste paper basket checking for guest belongings.
- 4. Check waste paper baskets for guests belongings before emptying them into the trash bag of the maids cart.
- 5. Collect all loose papers and magazines and stack them neatly on the desk.

## Maintenance Check

Check the room for maintenance requirements. and report the same to the control desk. She will enter such maintenance requirements in the room checklist. The checks include the following:

## Electrical Work

Faulty airconditioning or heating; fused bulbs; non-working lights and lamps; defective plugs and plug points, short-circuiting of any kind; faulty geysers, mini-bars, microwave ovens, kettles and hairdryers.

Bed making may appear simple by domestic standards, but requires technical expertise in a hotel because of the sheer volume of beds to be made in a given shift. If a room attendant has to prepare 16 rooms as per prevalent standards in a shift, she has potentially 32 beds to make in a shift. This is in addition to cleaning the rooms and bathrooms. It is here that her productivity is determined. Given below are the detailed steps for making a bed:

- 1. Pull the bed away from the headboard by tugging the bed from the foot of the bed. All beds in hotels are mounted on wheels for easy maneuverability.

<!-- image -->

- 2. Remove all soiled linen from the bed. Shake them out for any guest articles that may be misplaced in the folds.
- 3. Deposit the soiled linen in the linen hamper of the maid cart.

- 4. Invert mattresses over-side and end-to-end to ensure even use, every alternate day. Adjust the skirting so that they fall evenly to the floor.

<!-- image -->

- 5. Shake out the mattress protector and relay it on the mattress. Change the protector if soiled or smelling.

<!-- image -->

## 274

- 6. Clean the headboard with a feather duster or cloth duster.

<!-- image -->

- 7. Open out a fresh lower sheet and tuck it securely at the head, sides and at the foot of the bed.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 8. Miter the corners following the sequence shown in the pictures below:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 276

- 9. Open out the fresh top sheet and distribute it evenly on the lower sheet. Ensure that the laundry crease is in the same line as the inner sheet for even distribution. The sheet hem must be evenly pulled up to the headboard. Tuck this sheet at the footboard.

<!-- image -->

- 10. Open out the blanket and distribute it evenly on the top sheet using the crease as described earlier for even distribution. Ensure that the blanket labels are at the foot of the bed. Pull the blanket eight inches from the headboard to position the pillows and create a fold for the guest to slide in.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 11. Fold the top sheet at the head of the bed, over the blanket and fold the blanket and top sheet once again.

<!-- image -->

- 12. Ensure that the blanket and top sheet are tucked uniformly under the mattress on both sides and the corners at the foot of the bed are mitered.

<!-- image -->

- 13. Fold the corner of the blanket and top sheet as shown in the picture for the guest to easily slide into the bed. (Some hotels will do this only during evening turn-down service)

<!-- image -->

## 278

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

- 14. Cover pillows with fresh pillow covers. Fluff the pillow and even out pillow covers to look full, neat and tidy. Since pillow slips are usually larger than the pillow the excess slip should be neatly folded downward. The side of the pillow which has the fold should be away from the guest view. In turn-down service a breakfast knob is placed on the pillow.

<!-- image -->

- 15. Cover the completed bed with a bed spread ensuring it is right side up and falling evenly all around the bed to look appealing. The bed spread corners must fall to the floor in an aesthetic manner.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 16. Tuck the bed spread under the pillows to complete the bed.

17. Push the bed back towards the headboard ensuring that it is aligned.

## 280

- 18. Put spare blankets (upon guest request) in plastic covers and store in the top shelf or lower shelf of the guest wardrobe. The blankets are folded in a manner where the hotel logo is at the top.

## Room Cleaning

- 1. Place  room service  trays  and  trolleys  outside  along  the  corridor wall and call room service from the room telephone to clear them.
- 2. Commence the dusting of all surfaces in a clockwise direction in the room. Clean all surfaces in a circular motion with a dry duster. Use a hand dustpan to collect any unwanted matter on the surfaces without lifting dust in the air. Ensure that all surfaces are spotlessly clean. Pay special attention to nooks and corners especially those points that may not be visible to the guest eye.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- 3. Use  a  stiff  bristled  brush  or  vacuum  cleaner  with  the  appropriate attachment to clean upholstered furniture.
- 4. Replace stationery as per standard numbers prescribed by management. The normal standard is six letter heads and six envelopes. Some hotels also provide postcards in the stationery kit.
- 5. Dust and replace each item on dressers, bureaus and desks. Special attention must  be  given  to  the  display  of  publicity  materials  as  prescribed  by  the management.
- 6. Clean lamp shades with a feather duster. Lift lamps and clean under the base. Replace lamps and adjust the lamp shade.
- 7. Disinfect the telephone mouthpiece with Dettol. Wipe the balance of the telephone with a damp cloth. Check phone for the dial tone.
- 8. Clean the mirror with a dry cloth first and then with a damp newspaper to make it sparkling.

<!-- image -->

- 9. Dust the wardrobe, shelves, hangers and rods. Brush the wardrobe floor. Supply new laundry bags and replace missing hangers and under-liners.

## The Dirty Dozen

Certain areas in a room or bathroom elude the maids attention and tend to accumulate dust. Such areas are normally hidden from a guests eye. However, its cleanliness reflects the standard of cleaning of the hotel. Experience shows that the following areas are overlooked and appropriately called the The Dirty Dozen.

- 1. The top of door edges and the ceiling
- 2. Airconditioning ducts and diffuser grills.
- 3. Under bathroom counters and grab bar.
- 4. Beneath the dresser table.

## Evening Service

Most of the room cleaning would have been done in the morning and afternoon shift. The exception would be rooms with a Do-not-Disturb sign. Such rooms are normally occupied by late  night/early  morning  arrivals,  especially  crews.  All  occupied  rooms,  however,  require  an evening turn-down service to prepare the room for the night. The room attendant will follow the procedure given below:

- 1. Knock and enter the room as per procedure given before.
- 2. Put all light switches on, to check that they are working.
- 3. Draw heavy curtains to give privacy to guests at night.
- 4. Hang loose guest clothes in the wardrobe.

## Housekeeping Control Desk

## ROLE OF THE CONTROL DESK

The housekeeping control desk is the nerve centre of the  entire  department.  Its  efficiency  determines  the effectiveness of the housekeeping function. It is a focal point  for  the  dissemination  of  information  and communication to various points in the housekeeping department  as  well  as  other  departments  for coordination.  The  location  of  the  control  desk  is normally  adjacent  to  the  Executive  Housekeepers office.  This  desk  is  manned  24hours otherwise the lifeline  of  housekeeping  communication  would  stop. We know that housekeeping is a 24x7 function.

<!-- image -->

The role of the Housekeeping Control Desk is to

facilitate communication to various parts of the hotel. This role is exercised in many forms:

- l The communication role commences with a large display board for housekeeping staff. The housekeeping desk displays the following information:
- 1. Room numbers of groups in the house.
- 2. Room numbers of crews in the house.
- 3. Night cleaning schedule.
- 4. VIPs in the house.
- 5. Weekly cleaning schedules.
- 6. Daily roster of supervisors and staff.
- 7. Any other significant information.
- l It is the control desk attendant who receives departure room numbers from the front office and transmits them to the appropriate floor supervisor. Likewise, the floor supervisor informs the  desk  attendant  once  rooms  are  cleaned  and  ready  for  sale.  The  desk  attendant, accordingly, informs the front office receptionists.

## 286

- l The desk attendant advises the housekeeping floor staff about VIPs in the house. The front office alerts the control desk of such arrivals. With this information, the housekeeping can take extra care in cleaning the VIP rooms by equipping the rooms with additional amenities as per the policy of the management. Additional amenities could include bathrobes, bath slippers, extra soaps, hangers, and glass tumblers. The VIP can get a superior vanity set as also flower arrangements.
- l The front office also alerts the desk attendant over the phone about the groups expected and those in the house. Groups arrive and depart together which means that the rooms are cleaned at the same time and within strict time parameters. Sometimes a group in a busy hotel could have arrived and be waiting in the lobby for the allocation of rooms. Since check-in and check-out times are the same (i.e. Noon), housekeeping are under pressure to prepare departure rooms which have been just vocated, speedily to allocate volume rooms to a group.
- l Reception also alerts the desk attendant about expected and existing crews in the house. Normally airline crews are allotted a given set of rooms on given floors. Like groups, airline crews arrive and depart at the same time. Very often the arrival of a crew and the departure of another may overlap. In such circumstances, it is important for the allotted rooms to be cleared within a short period of time. Also because of odd international timings, it is the crew rooms that display the Do-not-Disturb sign at times when other guests are out.
- l The control desk attendant is the main point of contact with the resident guests of the hotel. Hotel room directories provide the control desk extension number to the guests which they can use if they require housekeeping services. The control desk attendant receives all the messages of the guests such as a request for extra blankets, baby-sitting services, etc. which she transmits to the concerned floor supervisor for further action.

## COORDINATION WITH THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT

Another vital area of coordination for the desk control attendant is with the engineering department. All room attendants register maintenance requests with the control desk attendant. The control desk attendant records this information in a maintenance register (fig. 6.1) mentioning the room number, nature of complaint and the name of the supervisor or room attendant who lodged the complaint. The desk attendant prepares a Maintenance Slip (fig. 6.2) in duplicate. She retains the second  copy  in  her  book  and  forwards  the  first  copy  to  the  Engineering  Department.  The Engineering Department then prepares a Work Order slip (fig. 6.3) and sends the concerned technician directly to the floor. When the work is completed satisfactorily, the room attendant or the Floor Supervisor signs the Work Order to acknowledge the successful completion of the task. The technician hands over the signed Work Order to the desk attendant who enters the same in the maintenance register against the appropriate complaint earlier registered.

## Fig. 6.3 Work Order Slip

The Maintenance Department of modern hotels assigns an all-purpose engineer to handle routine maintenance. He is known as the Ken-Fixit man. He moves on guest floors with a maintenance trolley equipped with essential tools to manage all the routine maintenance failures. This system has ensured a speedy attention to maintenance requirements.

The Maintenance Department also employs a preventive maintenance schedule during the year. Preventive maintenance is a programme of equipment upkeep so that breakdowns do not occur. The maintenance will coordinate with housekeeping to withdraw equipment in service to check them and prolong their serviceability. Housekeeping must honor the preventive maintenance schedule for their good. The Maintenance Department maintains a preventive maintenance record of each equipment in the hotel.

## TYPES OF REGISTERS AND FILES MAINTAINED

- 1. Register for guest messages: The guest message register (fig. 6.4) keeps all the special messages/requests of the guests. Messages could be requests for second service, additional blankets, fresh towels, cribs, maintenance requirements, and orthopedic mattresses.

- 3. Room Checklists file: A  Floor  Supervisor  checks  each  room  prepared  by  the  room attendant, before the room is handed to the front office for sale. She uses the room checklist (fig. 6.6) to guide her to examine as per the standards set by the management, during her inspection. She ticks the items found okay and makes comments on things which are not upto  the  standards.  The  deficiencies  will  have  to  be  rectified  by  the  room  attendant immediately. The checklist reflects the performance of the room attendant as well as the supervisor. It is handy to refer to it in the event of a guest complaint. All room checklists are

290

deposited by the floor supervisors at the control desk and filed for a month. Should a complaint about the cleaning in a room be received, the housekeeper would know exactly which attendant was responsible and whether she checked the particular aspect under compliant.

## ROOM CHECKLIST

| Wardrobe hangers Laundry Lists Laundry bags |           | Comments |

- 4. Carpet Shampoo Register: The register has the schedule of carpet shampooing and the data to show whether the schedule is being followed or not.
- 5. Room Occupancy Reports file: All  room  occupancy  reports  are  filed.  The  room occupancy reports are important to the Executive Housekeeper to determine the level of workload anticipated so as to provide the necessary staff to meet exigencies each day.
- 6. Duty Roster file: The duty roster is filed for information, if required by any one in the department.
- 7. Log Book: It is the single most important register as here instructions to staff of the next shift are written. This log-book is referred to by the supervisors at the beginning of any shift for instructions by the previous shift. The log book will also record room numbers of difficult guests, room numbers where roll-away beds are provided, distribution of extra supplies, etc. The log book is a free ruled register to write any information necessary.
- 8. Memo-book: This book has reminder slips to the Maintenance Department for outstanding maintenances  due.  This  information  is  made  in  copies  so  as  to  alert  the  concerned housekeeping supervisor that work is incomplete. It is important to ensure that the guest is not inconvenienced due to a lapse in maintenance or rooms are not cleared for sale because of some fault in it.

## LOST AND FOUND

Lost and Found is a term used in hotel terms for those articles left by guests or misplaced by guests in a hotel. Such articles can range from jewellery, costly electronic goods, travel documents, to simple garments. The hotel is obliged to protect such items and return them to the guests. The procedure for lost and found items is:

## Procedure

- 1. When the article is found the housekeeping staff, usually room attendants and public area housemen, must immediately report this to the immediate supervisor.
- 2. The supervisor (the Floor Supervisor or the Public Area Supervisor) immediately informs the control desk attendant.
- 3. The control desk attendant will verify with the front office cashier whether a resident guest is still in the process of paying his or her bill or whether s/he has checked out. If the guest is still available, s/he is contacted for the handover of the article/s to him.
- 4. The Lobby Manager is informed in case those guests who may be visitors to the hotel and not residing in it, are to be contacted to lodge a complaint.
- 5. If the guest is not available, the control desk attendant fills the Lost and Found Slip (fig. 6.7) in duplicate giving the date, time, room number, location, the guests name if found in a room, and the name of the finder.

Fig. 6.7 Lost and Found Slip

- 7. The Executive Housekeeper obtains the forwarding address of the guest from the front office who would have the information in the registration card. If the guests name is not known then housekeeping would have to wait for the guest to claim it.
- 8. The Executive Housekeeper will call or write to the guest to either claim it or give further instructions. It is preferable to write to have a record. If there is no immediate response from the guest, the housekeeper will send a written reminder.
- 9. If the guest returns to claim it, s/he would have to furnish details of the article before it is handed to him or her. The guests signature is taken in on the Lost and Found Slip in acknowledgement of having received the same.
- 10. If the article has to be mailed to the forwarding address, as instructed by the guest, the article should be sent under registered post or courier with the charges made known to the guest and claimed from him/her as cash on delivery.
- 11. If the guest does not claim the article in spite of reminders, the article is kept for a specific period as prescribed by the management (usually six months) and either gifted to the finder or auctioned to housekeeping staff. In such circumstances, the housekeeper will issue a gate pass (fig. 6.9) to the employee for the security, so that she can take the article out of the hotel.

## COORDINATION WITH THE FRONT OFFICE

This coordination is perhaps the most critical because the sale of rooms depends on it. We are aware that room space is perishable. This means that every minute a room is vacant, the hotel incurs a loss of revenue. The front office agents challenge is to lease room space back-to-back to realise the full potential of the rooms space. This is possible only if the room is available to the front office agent to sell. Departure rooms are required to be cleaned for sale at the soonest possible time. The productivity standard ranges from 20 minutes to 40 minutes based on the size of rooms. It is the responsibility of the front desk to inform the housekeeping control desk the moment the room is released by the guest. The desk attendant must immediately inform the Floor Supervisor about such departures. Likewise, the Floor Supervisor must immediately inform the housekeeping control desk once the room is cleared for sale. There is immediacy about this crucial  communication  on  which  room  revenues  are  based.  The  front  desk  also  advises  the housekeeping control desk about group arrivals and crew arrivals. We have already read about the importance of such volume arrivals. The front desk also depends on the housekeeping for the Housekeeping Room Report in each shift. This confirms the occupancy status of each room so that the front desk can cross tally their room racks with this information.

## HOUSEKEEPING SUPPLY ROOM

The Housekeeping Supply Room is a support store to all floors and public area supervisors. It is under the direct supervision of the Executive Housekeeper and therefore, is located in the control desk precincts. It stores expensive power driven equipment like floor scrubbing machines, carpet shampooing machines, floor polishing machines, vacuum cleaners and their accessories. The room also has emergency supplies such as guest and cleaning supplies in the event of a need before the allotted issue day given by the general stores. It, therefore, stores one weeks supply of cleaning supplies such as soaps, detergents, polishes etc; guest supplies such as stationery, soaps, matches, toilet paper, tissues etc; hand cleaning tools such as mops, brooms, brushes etc. The store is replenished on a weekly basis from the general stores using the requisition procedure.

## HOUSEKEEPING FURNITURE STORE

Each hotel possesses relatively large quantities of furniture which are not always in service. This furniture is most often associated with the food and beverage department and is required for banquets and special functions. Upholstered chairs and sofas, dressers, desks, cribs, etc. usually complete the supply. Because of the large amount of money represented by this furniture and because its use is usually required on short notice, they are kept in safekeeping by the housekeeping. Housekeeping must observe few simple rules with regard to such storage:

- 1. The store should be protected from weather, though well-ventilated.
- 2. Furniture requiring repair should not be stored here but in the furniture yard.
- 3. Furniture must be thoroughly cleaned before being stored.
- 4. Furniture must be wrapped in cloth before they are stored.
- 5. If space limitations require stacking, this should be done with care and with provision of adequate padding or other surface guards to prevent damage to furniture items.

## 294

- 6. Furniture that requires repair or renovation should have a Work Order, completed prior to sending it to the furniture yard.
- 7. No furniture should be stored in stairwells or service landings.
- 8. Decisions must be made promptly, whether damaged furniture is repairable or beyond repair. If obsolete they should be disposed as soon as possible for two reasons: a) they occupy valuable space; and b) they will further depreciate in storage.

## STORES REQUISITION

We have read earlier, that the Floor Supervisor prepares the Stores Requisition Form (Fig. 4.5 in Lesson 4), in triplicate to supplement supplies in her floor linen room. Similarly, the Public Area Supervisor prepares stores requisitions for her needs. The desk control attendant also prepares a requisition in triplicate for the housekeeping store to keep a record of emergency stocks. One copy of the requisition form is retained in the requisition book of each supervisor; the second is meant for the storekeeper; while the third is returned to the supervisor showing any balances of supplies  not  issued.  These  are  consolidated  by  the  desk  control  attendant  who  forwards  the second and third copies of all requisitions to the Executive Housekeeper for approval. She will examine the requisitions and approve them or call the concerned supervisor for explanations if she is in doubt. We know by now that the Executive Housekeeper has to be careful when approving supplies as they cost and impact on her budget. Once approved the concerned supervisor is ready to withdraw the supplies from the general store. The General Store stocks items of daily consumption for the whole hotel. The store is manned by a qualified storekeeper and assisted by a helper to draw items from various shelves. Due to the heavy demand on the store, they allot days to each department for their respective withdrawals. On the allotted day, the housekeeping control  desk  attendant  will  inform  the  concerned  supervisor  to  come  personally  or  send  a representative from her department to withdraw their supplies from the store. The storekeeper verifies the approval of the Executive Housekeeper on each requisition before issuing the items. He will mention items that are out of stock on the requisition form for delivery on the next issue day. The storekeeper retains the second copy of the requisition form after receiving the signature of the person withdrawing items and returns the third copy with his signature to the withdrawer.

The Linen Room usually serves as the base of operations for most housekeeping departments. It is usually under the control of a supervisor who has the responsibilities to issue fresh linen and receive soiled linen. A linen room could have a dedicated linen store which keeps a stock of new linen  to  replenish  those  in  circulation  when  they  are  lost  or  damaged.  The  amount  of  linen maintained is based on the size of the property. Linen is very expensive and when one considers the amount of linen used for a hotel the investment is enormous. The amount of linen is based on the total number of linen required to equip all rooms and restaurants at one time. This is considered as linen in circulation. This par is multiplied keeping in mind the time to wash soiled linen. An inhouse laundry should take 24 hours to launder a set of linen while outsourced laundries may take 48 hours. Keeping this in mind progressive hotels will maintain a turnaround par stock of five:

- 1 round in use
- 1 round in the floor linen room
- 1 round in the laundry
- 1 round in the linen room
- 1 round in the linen store (optional)

It is quite normal to have a round of four. Anything less may pose a challenge to the housekeeper. Every hotel will have a policy regarding the change of bed linen. Deluxe properties may want to change used bed linen everyday. Economy properties may change linen every alternate day or every three days. In any case, a room cleared for sale to a new guest will always have fresh linen. The Floor Supervisor will ensure that the hotel policy is met. The challenge for the Linen Supervisor increases if the property uses different coloured linen for each restaurant outlet. Each colour will need its own par stocks. While it is prudent for all hotels to have white, interior design concepts may insist on coloured linen.

Linen rooms are of two types: 1) centralised ones where all linen is controlled at a central point.  Such  linen  rooms  are  found  at  resorts  which  may  have  a  few  rooms  only  to  justify centralisation. 2) The other type of linen room operation is one which is decentralised where the main linen room feeds floor pantries which maintain linen par stocks to service a given number of

rooms on the floor or a set of floors. This system is ideal for large buildings, especially high rise ones, which have several floors and covers a considerable distance from the linen room to justify decentralisation  to  encourage  productivity.  It  is  useful  for  expanded  resorts  that  have  chalets spread over large acreage that requires feeder linen rooms to reach the remote locales. The floor pantries are controlled by floor supervisors.

## STORAGE CONDITIONS

As the linen and uniform stores carry valuable capital investment of the owner, the stores must follow strict conditions of storage to prolong the life of these assets. The storage conditions are:

- 1. The rooms must be so constructed as to eliminate the possibility of damage by insects. The floors must be cemented with special grouting along walls and corners to prevent insects and rodents from creeping in.
- 2. The room must be well-ventilated, cool and dry. Damp conditions cause mildew, a bacterial growth that damages cloth.
- 3. Hot water or steam pipes should not run through the linen and uniform rooms. The rooms should also be protected against dampness, sunlight and chemical fumes.
- 4. Properly designed racks should be used so that rust and white ants do not get to the material. Wood or aluminum racks are sturdy and non-corrosive. The last shelf of the rack should be at least six inches above the floor to prevent dust, water or insects to reach the material.
- 5. The room must have only one entry or exit point for security reasons.
- 6. The room should be accessible to linen/uniform room personnel only.
- 7. The room should be so located as to be easily accessible to all employees as well as the laundry.
- 8. The room should have a counter for the exchange of linen/uniforms.
- 9. The rooms must be subject to periodic schedules of pest control.

## Storage Tips for Linen

- 1. Restaurant and floor linen should be arranged by size and neatly stacked in shelves.
- 2. Heavier linen must be stacked in lower shelves while lighter ones on higher shelves.
- 3. Cotton items like sheets, pillow cases, table cloth, etc. should not be stored for a long time unless they are washed to remove starch. Starch or finishing chemicals attract insects which may have a tendency to make fabric dry and brittle
- 4. For long-term storage wrap items in plastic foils or pack in paper-lined cartons after washing. Dark paper is preferred to preserve colour. Wrap loosely to permit air to circulate.

## Storage Tips for Uniforms

- 1. Uniforms of better quality materials should be preferably hung.
- 2. Uniforms made of cheaper materials (used by back house personnel) should be separated size-wise and stacked in racks.
- 3. Small items like gloves, caps, ties, bows, etc. should be kept in closed cupboards.
- 4. Soiled uniforms must be dumped into hampers.
- 5. Coloured or embroidered materials or those with indelible ink should be laundered before storing to prevent discolourization.

## EXCHANGE OF LINEN

The exchange process is very critical to the Linen Supervisor as it is here that linen counts can go wrong. Even one piece of linen a day lost or misplaced adds to quite a number in the month. It is for this reason that she must maintain a strict exchange process. She coordinates closely with the Laundry Manager or Supervisor. She keeps a track of movement of linen loads from floors and from the linen room. She must ensure that the exchange norm of one fresh item with the soiled one is meticulously followed. Given below are the processes used to fulfil an efficient exchange process:

## Room Linen

- 1. Room linen is either directly received by the laundry or via the linen room.
- 2. In either case, The Floor Supervisor physically counts each soiled item on the floor and enters the figures into the Room Linen Control Sheet (Fig. 7.2) in triplicate. One copy is retained by the Floor Supervisor.
- 3. The second and third copies of the Room Linen Control Sheet are sent with the floor houseman with the hamper of soiled linen to the laundry or linen room. Alternatively, she will send the linen through the linen chute which lands at the laundry floor. The Laundry would give specific times for each floor to send their linen so that there is no mix-up with linen from other floors. In such a case, the Floor Supervisor will send her representative to the laundry floor first before she dispatches the linen from the chute.

- 4. The Laundry Supervisor or Linen Supervisor, where applicable, re-counts the soiled linen in the presence of the floor representative, usually a houseman, and verifies the quantities in the Room Linen Control Sheet. The concerned supervisor then stamps Received after the tally and returns the second copy while the third copy is retained by him/her. If the laundry supervisor is directly receiving the laundry s/he sends the second copy to the linen supervisor while retaining one copy.
- 5. The linen supervisor issues fresh linen on a one-to-one basis. In case the linen room is short of fresh linen at that point of time then s/he enters the balance due on the Room Linen Control Sheet and issues the shortfall in the next exchange.

## Discarded Linen

An important part of linen keeping is the use of discarded linen. Discarded linen are those that cannot  be  issued  for  use  in  operations.  Discards  occur  due  to  irretrievable  stains,  tears, discolouration, etc. Discarded linen has to be shown to the accountant who has to declare the item to be of no use and take it out of his inventory register. He has to stamp the items as discards and immediately account for such discards in the register. The linen keeper also maintains a discard register which gives the date and numbers of such discards. The figures indicate to the housekeeper new purchases that may be required or requisitioned from the housekeeping store. The Linen Supervisor has many uses for discards:

- l Used as cleaning cloths for the cleaning crew.
- l Used for covering furniture stored in the furniture yard.
- l Used to wrap carpets kept in storage.
- l Used to cover carpets in rooms when other maintenance is in progress.
- l Torn into rags for polishing purposes.
- l Used to wrap long stored linen and uniforms.

## THE UNIFORM ROOM

Large properties  may  have  an  independent  uniform  room  because  of  the  sheer  numbers  of personnel  involved.  An  investor  may  believe  that  the  investment  in  space  for  this  activity  is unavoidable. Medium to small hotels will combine the linen and uniform room to be space efficient. The conditions for storage of uniform rooms are similar to those as linen rooms as stated earlier Fig 7.5 gives a typical uniform room layout.

Fig. 7.5 Layout of a Uniform Room

<!-- image -->

We will note that the uniform room also has exchange counters for employees and the laundry. The uniform room must be located where all employees have access. The corridor in front of the room must be wide for several employees who may form a queue during morning rush hours. The corridor must not be congested so as not to permit other traffic to continue.

## UNIFORM EXCHANGE PROCEDURE

New employees are issued uniforms upon the authorization of the Personnel Department. They would be measured for sizes and either given standard uniforms like dungarees, stewarding trousers etc.  of  general  use  or  tailor  made  for  specific  front  house  positions  like  the  lobby  manager, concierge, receptionist, etc. Once issued, the employee keeps his/her uniform in a locker provided in a locker room. The hotel provides locker rooms separately for men and women with showers and toilets. Employees of various departments are given specific times to exchange their uniforms. When the employee returns for exchange of a new set the Uniform Room Supervisor will:

- 1. Ensure that the staff has arrived at the stipulated time.
- 2. Check uniforms for damages.
- 3. Issue fresh uniforms strictly on a one-to-one basis ensuring that the uniform is of correct size. Tailor-made uniforms will have name tags sewn inside the collar or trouser flap in indelible ink. The supervisor will make sure that the uniform with correct name tag is issued to the right person.

Note: If the soiled uniform is damaged and can be mended, the supervisor will warn the employee. If the uniform cannot be mended, she should report the matter to her superior who will inform the Human Resources Department to deduct the uniform cost from the employees salary if s/he is a chronic offender.

## EXCHANGE PROCEDURE WITH THE LAUNDRY

## Handing over Linen and Uniforms to the Laundry

Uniform/linen is sorted as per size, department, quality and type. They are physically counted in the presence of the laundry supervisor before handing them over to him. Uniforms for dry cleaning are submitted against a Daily Delivery of Uniforms Form while room linen is submitted against the Room Linen Control Sheet (Fig. 7.2). The Restaurant linen is submitted against the Food and Beverage  Exchange  Form.  In  all  cases  the  laundry  Supervisors  signature  is  taken  in acknowledgement.

## Receiving Fresh Linen

- 1. Room linen is received from the laundry on the basis of figures shown in the copy of the Room Linen Control Sheet received and stamped by the Laundry Supervisor.
- 2. Restaurant linen is received on the basis of figures in the Linen Exchange Register filled in earlier when exchanging soiled linen with the restaurant staff.
- 3. Uniforms for dry cleaning are received with the help of figures shown in the Daily Delivery of Uniforms Forms filled in earlier when submitting uniforms to the laundry for dry cleaning.
- 4. Linen is received from the laundry in lots as and when it is ready. Each type of linen is totaled and filled in the Inventory of Room Linen Form. The difference in items due from the laundry is established by comparing the totals of the above from the totals in the second copy of the Linen Control Sheet (for room linen). These two figures (i.e. Soiled delivered to the laundry and the fresh received from the laundry) are noted down in a register for every item everyday. On the closing of the month the total shortage from the laundry is worked out. The linen and uniforms are segregated and stored in the respective places.

## PAR STOCKS

## Definition

Par stock is the minimum level of supplies required to meet daily demands to ensure smooth operations.

## Importance of Par Stocks

- 1. To make correct and efficient investment of capital. The investor does not want to put in more money than is necessary for smooth operations. We will learn in the next section that a wellequipped hotel maintains a linen turn-around of four to five times the requirement. Such investment incur costs and so the investment must justify the ends. Uniforms too have a turn-around of four times.
- 2. To  prevent  over-stocking. Thereby  to  avoid  chances  of  spoilage  during  storage. Oversupply is not only a cost to the owner but also idle utilization of linen and uniforms, that could get damaged in storage. A lack of control on excess linen and uniforms can lead to misuse, theft and loss.
- 3. To make optimum use of space. When one considers the volume of linen and uniforms in circulation on a given day, it is obvious that any excess linen would have to be stored when not in use. Storage space costs. The owner could well use that space for revenue generating activities. The housekeeper must have the right amounts of linen and uniforms to save space.
- 4. To ensure proper supply at all times. Rooms cannot be sold unless the rooms are ready for sale. Rooms can only be ready if there is adequate supply of fresh linen to replace soiled ones. Luxury hotels change linen everyday and the room cannot wait to be ready for want of linen. Similarly, employees cannot report on duty if they do not have uniforms. The challenge for linen keepers and laundry supervisors is to keep the fresh linen and uniform supply always available throughout the day.

## 310

- 5. To help in effective budgeting. The Executive Housekeeper knows exactly the amount of capital investment in linen and uniforms required every year, based on standards called par stocks. She will be able to easily calculate the deficiencies in par stock due to damage or loss.
- 6. To simplify inventory taking. Audits are conducted periodically to safeguard the owners investment in this capital item. It becomes easy for auditors to tally the par stock because the numbers are known.
- 7. To bring about control. Par stocks enable the linen keeper maintain control on the numbers issued each day. She can calculate the deficiencies in supply to feed the operations and will chase the laundry for additional washing cycles.

## How to Establish Par Stock

The sections below give a simple way to establish par stock figures.

Linen

Determine the requirement of each guest room and restaurant per  shift. This is multiplied four times as per the following cycle:

One change in circulation

One change in the floor linen rooms

One change in the laundry

One change in the linen room

One change in the housekeeping store (optional)

Uniforms

The par stock of uniforms is determined on the basis of a) cloth material and b) job positions and the nature of jobs. Four changes are kept for uniforms changed daily such as waiter coats, utility worker uniforms, etc. More specialised uniforms may have a turnover of two to three times only, in view of cost. The cycle of par stock is as follows:

One change in the laundry

One change in the Uniform room

One change in the housekeeping store

One change in use

## INVENTORY CONTROL

Since uniforms and linen are heavy investments, it is necessary to keep a close control on this very important asset. Effective control is possible through the following practices:

- (a) Control on misuse, shortages and mix-ups
- (b) Proper storage
- (c) Regular stock-taking
- (d) Spot checks
- (e) Proper supervision
- To prevent damage to linen and uniforms the following tips need to be kept in mind.
- 1. Check for faulty  linen  chutes,  carts,  baskets,  washers,  etc.  which  might  tear  linen  and uniforms.

Figure 7.6 gives the Room Linen Inventory Form in which stock figures are taken.

<!-- image -->

- 2. The loss of small items of linen can be avoided by keeping mesh bags at strategic points for passing employees.
- 3. Put restrictions on the misuse of linen by employees by inspecting employee locker rooms or fining them for misuse.
- 4. Laundry should be careful not to put excessive amount of bleach powder. The usual amount is  1%  bleach  per  100  lbs  of  linen.  Also  bleach  powder  could  be  damaging  at  washing temperatures higher than 150 degrees F.
- 5. Linen should be exchanged strictly on a one-to-one basis.
- 6. Damp white linen or uniforms should not lie on concrete or iron. Concrete stains are almost impossible to remove while iron rust cause holes after washing.
- 7. Employees must not wipe spilt food, medicines or chemicals with linen. They should use dusters especially provided for the purpose.
- 8. Laundry should load washing machines properly. Under loading could beat up the linen.
- 9. Hydro-extractors on high speed operations could tear fabrics.
- 10. Laundry tumblers should be checked regularly for pins, paper clips, etc. that could prick holes into the fabric.
- 11. Proper pressure and heat must be kept on all irons as it could cause burn stains.

## STOCK-TAKING

## Definition

Stock-taking is the physical verification by counting of stocks of all items in the cycle at periodic intervals or at the time of the closing of books for valuation purposes or for the accuracy of recording entries in books, so that overages or shortages can be found out by a variance in physical balances and the accounts inventory ledger balance.

## Methods and Principles involved

- 1. Physical counting is done after every three months and is also known as quarterly inventory.
- 2. All items are segregated and grouped (including discards).

3.

Counting of items in circulation and in store is separately done and added together.

- 4. Discards are stamped Condemned and kept aside.
- 5. Counted total should tally with the last inventory figures plus issues received after that.
- 6. Inventory must be conducted in the presence of the housekeeper, Accounts clerk and the auditor.
- 7. Stock-taking is conducted on three separate days, each for:
- (a) Uniforms
- (b) Room linen
- (c) Restaurant Linen

## Public Area Management and Service

## 8.1 INTRODUCTION TO PUBLIC AREAS

## Introduction

Public areas of a hotel expand according to the financial outlay of the investors and their vision of the number of facilities they wish to provide to both resident guests and the public. We must understand that a hotel is open to  resident    guests  and  the  local  public  that  visits  it. Hotels have always been the centre of social activity for the local populace and the number of people that they can attract, adds to the stature of the property, as well as  the  revenue  that  they  generate.  To  the  investors, each space accessible to the public is a potential revenue area  and  therefore,  they  like  to  exploit  it  to  the

<!-- image -->

maximum. Investors have dug below the ground to create space as well as used rooftops to make them money spinners. The larger the hotel, in terms of the number of rooms, the larger is the public area required. Larger number of arrivals and departures will require greater lobbies; larger swimming pool; more elevators; larger food and beverage facilities; etc.

## Extent of Public Areas

The boundaries of public areas do not stop indoors. It extends to external areas too. There is the challenge of parking. If the hotel is frequented by local populace they will need large car parks. This can pose a problem in downtown locations where space is dear. Investors are forced to go underground to create multi-layered parking areas. The local building authorities also insist on a minimum ratio of empty space outside in relation to building space. This space translates into driveways; landscaped gardens; and utility areas. Then there is the huge responsibility of staff facilities. Hotel personnel need their own parking areas as well as entry and exit points. Purchase and Receiving departments need their own aprons for supplier trucks. There could well be a

steady stream of these trucks throughout the day when one considers the number of items required by the hotel.

In remote places such as resorts that do not have welldeveloped local towns to house their employees, hotels will be forced to have captive staff accommodation, especially when qualified personnel are imported. For example, it is mandatory for hotels in the Gulf States to provide staff accommodation since all the staff is hired from other parts of the world. Hotels in these countries have massive staff complexes that not only provide accommodation but also dining halls, recreation centres, staff laundries, drug stores, etc.

The complexity of hotel public areas increases if the hotel has its own private beach or independent chalets spread over large acreages. All surfaces have their own unique properties that need technical understanding to maintainthe roads  and car parks are made of tar; beaches of sand; pathways of stones; landscapes, golf courses,  tennis  courts  have  lawns;  swimming  pools, waterfalls,  rockeries  and  fountains  have  their  own cleaning challenges due to the presence of water; and hotel facades that are becoming more difficult to clean and  manage  as  the  architecture  is  getting  more complex.

## Scope of Activity

The diagram below gives the scope of activity involved for the public area crew in a typical large downtown hotel.

<!-- image -->

## 320

Basement: The basement consists of car parks, support offices as  human  resources,  housekeeping,  purchasing  and  training rooms in addition to staff cafeterias, linen and uniform rooms, stores and the staff cafeteria. Because of the heavy equipment involved,  the  basement  could  also  house  the  laundries  and engineering  plants  (engineering  and  heating,  fire-fighting, generators, etc).

<!-- image -->

Ground level: The ground level provides easy access to the public and therefore, it is ideal for certain revenue areas. The hotel could have a lower lobby that accesses the revenue areas like the

<!-- image -->

health club, upper car parks and restaurants. Discotheques and speciality restaurants could be positioned here. This is also the ideal spot for indoor recreation like squash courts, gymnasiums and swimming pools. Externally, a hotel would have the main landscapes with walkways leading to beaches and water sports. It is ideal for a lower level of shopping arcade.

Lobby Level: The entrance to the hotel is a floor up. It is here that the main reception and lobby is located. Many restaurants could lead the residents and local public to different places off the lobby. Of the restaurants, the coffee shop and the dining room are a must. Most groups would eat here, so the design permits easy access to these places through the lobby and not through the floors. The back office of the front office will be in the lobby as also the left  luggage  rooms,  security  deposit  rooms  and  telecommunications.  The shopping arcade extends off the lobby. The size of the lobby will respond to the  size  of  the  shopping  arcade.  Shopping

<!-- image -->

arcades will also have the travel agency; beauty salons; barber shops; money exchange; bank; post office; drug store; etc. This level could also have the accesses to the banquet halls and meeting rooms. These places assume importance because of the volume traffic that arrives during a short period. Meeting and function rooms are busy throughout the day for corporate functions while the night is busy for social functions.

<!-- image -->

Mezzanine Floor: This is where the executive offices of the General Manager, sales and marketing, accounts, food and beverage manager, etc are located. This could be the floor for the business centre.

<!-- image -->

Guest Floors: The  guest  floors  rise  above  the  mezzanine and relates to the number of rooms the hotel has. Public areas are not found on floors except perhaps for the business lounge which is exclusively for the resident guests who stay in the executive floors.

Roof top: This obviously affords a panoramic view. The investor would like to have the exclusive night club located here. Cocktail lounges can also be located on the roof top. Hotels with limited external space may locate the swimming pool at the rooftop. This is the difficult choice that the investor has to make.

## LESSON  8 Public Area Management and Service

Public areas of small hotels like resorts, motels and hostels may be limited to an all-purpose dining room and at the most, a bar. These properties may, however, have large external areas.

In the introduction to this book entitled Letter from the Author , it has been stated that the future of hotels is to be a part of a purposebuilt community.  The  complex  will  have  shopping  malls,  Cineplexes, Entertainment Centres, Commercial blocks, residential blocks, etc. If this be so then the responsibilities of the public area crews will be mind-boggling!

<!-- image -->

By now the reader must have realised the enormity of the responsibility of public area crews. The public  area  will  naturally  require  considerable  technical  expertise  in  cleaning  and  man management to complete the challenges ahead of them.

## 8.2 ROLE OF A PUBLIC AREA SUPERVISOR

## Introduction

The Public Area Supervisor is a crucial member of the housekeeping team. She supervises the cleanliness, maintenance and the aesthetic upkeep of all the public areas. We have seen in the first part of this chapter that her area of responsibility extends from the external gate of the hotel to the basements and rooftops. Naturally, she has to be a person who is physically fit and with boundless energy. This is a competency that is very essential to hold this role. She must be able to lead and motivate a large brigade who has to sometimes work under difficult circumstances. It takes a lot of skill and energy to supervise large areas, especially under pressure, in a busy hotel. The chart below shows the team that she works with:

<!-- image -->

## Cleaning Schedules

Though the structure  may  appear  simple,  the  numbers  involved  are  quite  large.  Public  area cleaners would each have a responsibility of 2500 sq. ft. at a minimum. If the hotel has large spaces, the count increases with each 2500 sq. ft. The challenge the Public Area Supervisor has is that the cleaning schedules have to be followed with least disturbance to guests. This means she has to cover the cleaning during the day and night. The night schedule assumes greater importance as that is when most services shut down. They are mostly the internal locations of the hotel. Let us see the areas that come in the night cleaning schedule:

## Night Cleaning Schedules

Restaurants and bars while most close by 12 midnight, night clubs can stay open till 3.00 am. The coffee shop, though open at night as well, is less occupied after the dinner service which completes at 12 midnight.

Executive Offices they close after 6.00 pm. Some like the General Managers office, reception back-office, accounts, etc. may stay open till late at night for work exigencies.

Business Centre normally closes at 6.00 pm.

Shopping arcade may stay open till eight at night. Some states keep their shopping facilities open till 11.00 pm.

Meeting Rooms meetings normally observe business hours and usually close at 6.00 pm.

Banquet Halls they can keep open till late hours. Award nights may extend till 12 midnight while wedding receptions till past midnight. The banquet halls are left in a mess with such a large traffic of people. If the hall is not required the next morning, the crew can have a respite at night.

Lobbies: All lobbies have to be cleaned at night after 12 midnight. Though there may be a few guests, cleaning has to proceed for the lobbies to be ready for early morning peak traffic.

Elevators: These can be shut down one by one for cleaning at night, as guest use them less at night.

Basements: These include the car park area, basement corridors, training rooms, staff locker rooms and support offices like purchasing, housekeeping, laundry, time-office and human resources. The linen/uniform rooms and stores are not accessible to the public area staff at night for security reasons.

Public Cloak rooms: They are relatively free after the restaurants close.

Naturally one wonders what is left for the day to be cleaned. They are mostly the external areas with some internal locations.

## Day Cleaning Schedules

Driveways, walkways, porch, external car parks, swimming pool areas, beach fronts, gardens (though the gardeners take that responsibility also) patios and terraces, roof top areas, night club, discotheque and cocktail lounges (because they open at night only), banquet halls (that are free in the morning), linen rooms and stores when they are under the supervision of the respective keepers.

## Supervisory Tasks

The Public Area Supervisor attends the departmental briefing by the Executive Housekeeper at the start of the day. She is particularly interested to know the special events in the hotel which will need attention. These events will indicate to her the work load expected in banquet halls, gardens, lobbies, restaurants, etc. She then proceeds to check the log book for any special messages left by the Night Supervisor before she proceeds to brief her staff.

## Briefing

While the principles of briefing as discussed earlier remain the same she will particularly do the following:

- 1. Take the attendance of her crew and ascertain the resources available to her.
- 2. She will check their turnout and confirm that they are according to the standards of the hotel.

## 324

- 3. Allot cleaning areas and instruct as to what has to be accomplished to each member of her crew.
- 4. Inform the crew about special events in the hotel that will need additional attention.

## Allocation of Equipment

The Public Area Supervisor will equip the crew with the tools required to do their tasks. She opens the housekeeping equipment store to distribute the tools. The equipment (please see Lesson 9. 1, Cleaning Equipment for details), available to the public area crew are the following:

<!-- image -->

Yard Brooms are used for sweeping external surfaces like the driveways, walkways, porch, car parks, employee entrance, roof tops and all other tarred and cemented floor areas. Public area cleaners would be removing dead foliage, mud and cigarette butts from these areas.

Sweeping Brooms are  used  for  cleaning  internal  floors  prior  to subjecting them to water cleaning. The typical surfaces would be found in uncarpeted corridors like the basements or public corridors found in shopping arcades and lobbies. The brooms remove the grime and mud from the surfaces that are swept into dustpans and deposited to common garbage areas.

<!-- image -->

Mops are  meant to be moistened in pails of water before being applied on the floors. Public floors with tiles, marble, granite,  terrazzo  and  linoleum  are  best  cleaned  with  this method.

Floor Dusters are used to wipe out dust only. It may not remove difficult stains and spots.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Squeegees are used when floors are washed down with water and not mopped. Public cloak rooms, service landings and stairwells are subject to this treatment. Squeegees have rubber endings that collect water with the sweep and diverted to drains.

Cotton mops are used when adequate drainage is not provided. These mops absorb the water and are then squeezed out into pails.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Floor Scrubbers are used for wiping difficult stains and spots on floors.

## LESSON  8 Public Area Management and Service

Feather Dusters are useful tools for cleaning public area tables, lamp shades, sofas and artefacts that are at floor level or on the walls. Feather dusters are light and do not scratch surfaces of delicate materials.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Hand Brush and Dustpan is the common tool that all public area cleaners will like to have to remove dirt from table tops, carpets or hard floors.

Buckets or pails are essential to any wet cleaning of surfaces.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Sponges are handy for all surfaces to clean and scrub difficult stains and spots. They work well with special detergent spray bottles.

<!-- image -->

Floor Polishers are expensive equipment used to polish floors especially those with stone finishes (granite, marble, terrazzo, etc.) Polishing is done on a weekly basis and sometimes monthly basis depending upon the frequency of use of the floor.

Heavy Duty Vacuum Cleaners are used for extensive carpet areas as those found in banquet halls, carpeted corridors, lobbies, executive offices, etc.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Carpet Shampoo Machines are used to shampoo carpets on a weekly or monthly basis depending on use. The machine has a simultaneous process to feed  and  suck  water  on  the  carpet  surface.  The  supervisor  has  a  special schedule for carpet shampooing to maintain them in pristine condition.

Drapery Cleaners are automated to clean extensive upholstery and curtains found in banquets, lobbies and restaurants.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Portable Steamers are used to wrinkle out draperies and upholstery found in public areas.

## 326

Trash Cans are essential to public area cleaning because it is here that all garbage is  deposited  to  be  later  emptied  into  large  garbage  dumps  cleared  by  the municipality garbage removal crews. Trash cans are kept at strategic points in exteriors to serve given areas.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Litter Bins of chrome are placed at all internal places in the hotel,  for  guests  to  stub  there  cigarettes.  The  are  placed especially outside elevators; lobbies and foyers; shopping arcade corridors; public bathrooms; and any other place where people are likely to congregate. They come in all shapes and sizes based on the density of traffic and purpose of use.

Bulb extractors are handy tools to remove and replace fused bulbs. Though this may be strictly a function of the maintenance department, it has been handed over to the public area cleaners and room attendants because it is a simple task that saves the time of long procedures if the maintenance department would be involved.

## Responsibilities of the Public Area Supervisor

## Taking Rounds

One of the prime responsibilities is to take rounds of the entire hotel. She will ensure that the standards  of  cleanliness  are  followed  and  the  methods  used  for  cleaning  are  the  right  ones. During her rounds, she will note all maintenance requirements which she will report to the control desk  attendant  to  make  the  appropriate  maintenance  orders.  She  will  follow-up  on  these maintenance requests till they are complete. She will coordinate with the horticulturist and the florist for flower arrangements, internal gardens and potted plants. Her main concern, however, is to see that function rooms are cleaned for the next event. Often banquet halls need cleaning during an event. She will ensure that this is done as discretely as possible.

The night supervisor is challenged because all the food outlets are active and other areas are closed. Therefore, most essential cleaning of public areas is done at night. Both the day and night shift supervisor will need to schedule their teams to ensure that all requirements are met.

During the rounds is the opportunity to meet with her team members individually and resolve their grievances, if any. It is at this time that she encourages them to give their best productivity. She will also give individual attention to coach team members who require special training.

## Appraisals and Training

One of the duties of the public area supervisor is to appraise her team members. She will set productivity  standards  and  objectives  against  which  she  will  evaluate  them.  She  will  give  her recommendations to the Executive Housekeeper for recognition and rewards for good performers. Alongside the appraisals, she will identify training needs. She will decide if those needs are fulfilled through coaching by her or will need the involvement of the Training Department. Some of the training inputs she will seek from the external sources are:

- 1. Use of fire-fighting equipment by the fire brigade

<!-- image -->

- 2. Use of cleaning equipment by suppliers
- 3. First-aid and CPR by St Johns Ambulance or similar experts
- 4. Team-building by the Training Department
- 5. Customer service skills by the Training Department

## 8.3 PUBLIC AREA CLEANING WORKFLOW

## Floor T erraces and Balconies

Housekeeping  room  attendants  do  not  ordinarily  have  the responsibility for floor terraces and balconies. Garden terraces are the responsibility of the gardener and/or a houseman especially assigned  for  this  purpose.  Where  the  responsibility  is  divided between the gardener and the houseman, it is the duty of the gardener to look after the condition of the plants, removing dead leaves  and  blossoms  whenever  neccessary.  The  houseman  is responsible for the removal of any debris. Cleaning is then to be carried out by the houseman who must ensure that terrace floors, under planters, tables or garden umbrellas are thoroughly cleaned

<!-- image -->

and dried. The designated houseman is also responsible for requisitions made to the maintenance department.

## Elevators

The housekeeping department is responsible for the cleanliness of the interior of the elevator cars. A thorough cleaning of walls, ceilings and floors should be carried out at least once daily. The volume of traffic may require more frequent cleaning of elevator floors. In cleaning elevator car interiors, the car should be taken to the topmost floor for the cleaning procedure to be carried out. Cleaning and polishing must be done in the early hours of the morning when guest traffic is at its lowest. Particular attention must be paid to recessed lighting troughs, ventilation louvers, door sills and grooves and the area around the operators control panel.

## Elevator Lobbies

The cleaning of elevator lobbies may be assigned to the houseman responsible for the corridor or alternately  to  an  individual  responsible  for  elevator  lobbies  only.  Mirrors,  lights,  promotional signs, upholstered furniture, door frames and sills, and sand urns must receive particular attention to ensure that they are clean and dust free. Vacuum cleaning of carpets should be done in this area in every shift due to heavy traffic.

## Corridors-Guest Floors

A houseman is assigned to do tasks and is responsible for the cleanliness of ceilings, walls and floors. Carpeted floors should be vacuum cleaned daily, tiled floors to be brushed, swept clean and then wet mopped. They should also remove stains. Floor tile edges, corners, baseboards and the immediate wall area above are to be inspected to ensure that there are no water marks. All corridor lighting fixtures are to be cleaned as often as required. It is also the responsibility of a houseman to clean fire extinguishers and fire extinguisher recesses including glass doors.

## Corridors-back-house

Corridors must be swept and mopped. This is an area of heavy staff traffic. The area will also have traffic of wheeled trolleys and equipment. Back-house corridors will be of concrete to take

heavy traffic. Some corridors leading to offices and lounges may be fitted with linoleum or carpet. Linoleum surfaces may be mopped while carpets vacuum cleaned.

## Floor Pantries

One maid/houseman is assigned on a rotational basis to be responsible for each floor pantry. This procedure is carried out to ensure that the pantry is kept clean and neat at all times. This assignment includes floor cleaning, dusting and the arrangement of shelving. The maid/houseman also have to see that the pantries are free from dishes, silverware, bottles and other trash of all kinds.

## Mop and Janitor Closet

The floor  houseman is  assigned  the  responsibility  for  the  maintenance  of  mop  closets.  This responsibility includes the total cleanliness of these areaswall, ceiling, floors, sinks and light fixtures. No accumulation of bottles or other trash is to be permitted at any time. No mops should be permitted to remain in these areas unless they have been thoroughly washed, rinsed and dried.

## Service Lobbies and Service Stairways

The floor houseman is assigned the task of cleaning these areas on a daily or more frequent schedule depending upon traffic requirements.

## Service Elevators

Most hotels give responsibility of cleaning service elevators to the kitchen stewarding department. However, some hotels may give this responsibility to the housekeeping in which case the same cleaning procedure as that established for guest elevators will apply to service elevators with the additional stipulation that floor cleaning must be carried out after every meal service.

## Function Rooms

Complete  cleaning  schedule  for  daily  cleaning  of  all function rooms should be prepared and assigned to the appropriate  personnel.  These  cleaning  schedules  will include the procedure for daily inspection and cleaning, if required,  of  walls  and  ceilings,  windows  and  window frames, floors and carpeting, lighting fixtures, draperies, pictures, lamps and furniture, particular attention should be paid to the legs of all chairs and tables and to the bases of floor lamps.

<!-- image -->

## Lobby

Lobby cleaning schedules should be prepared with due regard to the character of the lobby, particular facilities provided, and the activity and volume of traffic. These schedules must include walls, ceilings and floors, all metal work, lighting fixtures and lamps, air-handling outlets, planters, windows and draperies, showcases,  display  boxes,  cigar  stands,  bell  captains  desk, concierge desk, checkrooms and public toilets. The cleaning

<!-- image -->

## 330

standard for all marble work and terrazzo floors and stairways are to be separately set forth to ensure that the procedures followed will ensure meticulous cleanliness without damage to these surfaces, Aluminum, bronze, stainless steel and cast iron metal work are to be kept well-polished. Cleaning procedures and materials are found in Lesson 9.

## Shopping Arcade

The responsibility of cleaning the shops varies in different hotels and is usually dependent upon the type of rental agreement in existence between the hotel and the lessees. The housekeeper should check with the management to determine the area of responsibility and the housekeeping procedure necessary for the proper maintenance of these areas. In instances where the responsibility rests with the shopkeeper, the hotel management has the right and obligation to insist that the cleanliness and order of these shops are at least equal to the standard prescribed for other others of the hotel. The types of concessions include casinos, barber shops, beauty parlor, gift shop, travel bureau, offices and Show rooms.

## Cabanas

The cleaning  responsibility  of  cabanas  may  be  under  the  housekeeping  or  the  maintenance department based on who is given the responsibility.  In  either  case,  the  cleaning  procedure should be carried out with the same attention to detail as that used for guest rooms and guest rooms terraces.

## Bars, Soda Fountains and Snack Bars

The cleaning of these facilities is generally the responsibility of employees assigned by the Food and  Beverage  Department.  These  people  should  be  instructed,  however,  in  proper  cleaning methods by the housekeeping department in order to ensure clean sanitary maintenance of these facilities, particularly floors beneath and behind equipment.

## Restaurants

The basic cleaning of restaurants rests with the Housekeeping Department and follows the same cleaning standards as those prescribed for function rooms and lobbies. It is imperative that the housekeeping personnel assigned to these areas must work in  close  cooperation  with  the  employees  of  the  Food  and Beverage Department to ensure that the areas are clean and serviceable, well in advance of the time at which the restaurant actually requires them.

<!-- image -->

Legs of chairs and tables and bases must be thoroughly wiped daily. Soiled dish trolleys, pastry carts and other wheeled equipment should receive thorough daily cleaning with particular attention to castors to ensure that they are free from grease, food or mop strands.

Bandstands and stages should be cleaned by housekeeping personnel assigned for the purpose. Cleaning procedures vary with the individual area but standards should be the same as those prescribed for other public areas of the hotel. Cleaning of stage lighting fixtures, light troughs, skylights and indirect lighting is the responsibility of the personnel of the maintenance department, who are familiar with the care of such equipment and the inherent danger involved while working with water around electrical equipment.

## Offices

The housekeeping department is  responsible  to  clean  office receptions, offices and meeting rooms. Such cleaning procedures should include desks, chairs and other furniture such as cadenzas and  filing  cabinets.  In  order  to  facilitate  proper  cleaning,  the office personnel are required to remove loose papers, file folders, reports, etc. from the top of desks and filing cabinets at the close of each working day and store them in drawers, cupboards and

<!-- image -->

filing cabinets. Accounting books, records, purchase orders, invoices, payroll materials, etc. must not be kept loose. Receipts and invoices which will be audited must be bundled and labelled. The Accounting Department may like to supervise the cleaning of their areas as confidential records are maintained in the department. The cleaning schedule will include the business centre (top picture) and the business lounge (lower picture). The dustbins have to be cleared and carpets hovered.

<!-- image -->

## Linen and Uniform Rooms

These areas are the direct responsibility of the personnel employed by them. Uniform racks should be kept clean and in order. Shelving is to be kept free of uniform parts and pieces unless such material is wrapped and clearly labelled.

## Tailor Room

The housekeeping department assigns personnel to keep these rooms clean. Cleaning is to be accomplished at the end of each working day. Sewing machines should be covered when not in service. Particular attention must be paid to the floor to prevent the accumulation of scraps, lint and thread.

## Upholstery Shops

The upholsterer is responsible for the maintenance, cleanliness and safety in the shop. The entire shop should be cleaned and brought in order at the end of each working day. Upholstery fabrics must be kept in closed cartons. Loose filling materials are not permitted in the upholstery shop at any time. Scraps, waste and discarded materials should be kept in covered metal containers and removed from the shop at the close of each working day.

## Store Rooms

All store rooms should be constantly maintained in a clear and orderly manner. Shelf cleaning and the condition of stored merchandise is the responsibility of the storekeeper. Floor cleaning and wall cleaning should be performed by housekeeping employees requisitioned for this purpose on a regular basis. This provision is general for all stores except for refrigerated stores which are the complete responsibility of the food and beverage department.

## 332

## Swimming Pools

The bottom and sides of a swimming pool must be cleaned daily by pool personnel using vacuum cleaning equipment (many hotels give this responsibility to the Maintenance Department). In hotels which do not have filtration and water treatment equipment, pools should be emptied not less frequently than once a week and the walls and floors should be handscrubbed using wire brushes. Pool edge tiles and overflow gutters should be hand scrubbed on a continuing schedule so that the total circumference of the pool is completed once every four days. All outside terraces including those surrounding swimming pools are to be swept and wet mopped at least once daily depending upon the type of surface. Serrated tiles which have a tendency to accumulate oily films from bathers feet should be deckscrubbed using strong detergent solution on a schedule which will maintain the area with its original colours intact. Cleaners responsible for terrace areas will be responsible for keeping fungus from growing between tiles. Growth of this nature can be successfully arrested by periodic applications of rock salt. Employees responsible for the cleanliness of swimming pool areas will inspect diving boards, diving platforms and pool stairs daily to ensure that they are clean and safe. Pool personnel are responsible for all pool side furniture including chairs, lounge tables, sun mats and garden umbrellas.

## Basements

Basements may be used for car-parking or the installation  of  heavy  engineering  equipment. These areas need to be broomed daily and periodically washed clean. Engineering staff may prefer to keep their areas clean and will know how to deal with oil spills, tar stains, etc. If not then such care has to be provided by housekeeping cleaners.

## External Areas

External areas start from the gate apron; roads leading to the porch; the porch itself; car-parks; gardens; walkways; fountains; to beaches etc. Yard brooms are handy equipment for cleaning of these areas. The dirt and dust accumulated must be gathered in mobile trash cans and deposited at the municipal dump located in the precincts. Beaches are kept clean with sand rakes. Gardens are normally maintained by the gardeners themselves but take help of housekeeping at times.

## 9.1 CLEANING EQUIPMENT

## Equipment Selection

Cleaning  equipment  are  essential  tools  for  housekeeping  professionals.  They  help  improve productivity and efficiency. As equipment is expensive, their selection is of utmost importance. The correct choice and quality of equipment could save the costs of breakdowns, labour and time. During the purchase of equipment the following points should be kept in mind:

- 1. Quality  of  equipment  by  ascertaining  the  history  of  their  use  in  other  organisations.  It should be tested for its performance.
- 2. Reliability of the supplier to meet time deadlines.
- 3. Transportation on time to replenish stocks.
- 4. Weight of equipmentit should be light, well-balanced and easy to manipulate.
- 5. Availability of parts and accessories.
- 6. Sturdiness in terms of usage.
- 7. Cost factors.
- 8. Easy maintenance
- 9. Warranties
- 10. Productivity in terms of square feet it cleans in one hour.
- 11. Washing efficiency of extractors and wet vacuum cleaners in terms of the pressure with which they inject fluid. They come with pressures from 11 PSI to 1000 PSI. Similarly the solution recovery is equally important in terms of time taken to lift solutions as well as its completeness of task.
- 12. Appearance is important as the equipment will be in the view of guest.
- 13. Ease of handling of the equipments is an important factor as they should not physically overload the operators.

## Rules for the Storage of Equipment

To give equipment a longer life, they have to be handled with care. One criterion for proper care is their storage. Given below are some storage tips:

## 334

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

- 1. The store should be dry and wellventilated as dampness causes rust and mildew leading to degeneration of equipment.
- 2. The store should provide enough space for easy access to shelves and to facilitate proper cleaning.
- 3. The store should be properly locked to prevent pilferage.
- 4. The store should be accessible to all cleaning personnel without hindering other operations.
- 5. Buckets and pails must be cleaned dry before storing them.
- 6. Brushes should not rest on their bristles.
- 7. All detergents and polishes must be properly sealed before storage to prevent evaporation and drying.
- 8. Mops must be wrung and dried before storage.
- 9. There should be adequate racks and cupboards, properly labelled for easy identification.
- 10. Equipment must be cleaned thoroughly prior to storing them.
- 11. Equipment accessories must be labelled and kept preferably in cupboards.
- 12. Stock records should be maintained showing the following:
- (a) Date of purchase
- (b) Kind of stock and quality
- (c) Name of supplier
- (d) Cost per unit
- (e) Date of issue into service
- (f) Remarks on suitability and durability.
- 13. For the proper control of equipment their issues from the store must follow certain rules:
- (a) Equipment must be issued at definite times.
- (b) New issues must be made strictly against the worn out equipment.
- (c) Equipment must be labelled to show the information about the person to whom it has been issued e.g. his floor, public area etc.
- 14. The store must be subject to regular inspection and audit.
- 15. Expensive equipment must be covered in polythene to protect them from dust during storage.

## Cleaning Equipment

Cleaning equipment can be put into six broad categories:

## 1. Mechanical Equipment

Vacuum cleaners are the greatest friends of housekeeping cleaning staff. They come with nozzles and attachments for all types of surfaces. They are handy equipment for daily maintenance and find their way onto maid carts. Vacuum cleaners are recommended where there is a large amount of carpeted area in the hotel. There are many types of vacuum cleaners. The upright models work on a combined suction and beating process; and the floor modelscylindrical or spherical operate solely on suction. There are many kinds of upright vacuum

<!-- image -->

cleaners. The beater-bars vacuums agitate carpet piles and loosen dirt; brush vacuums agitate carpets glued to the floor; pile lifter vacuums have a strong suction capacity and a separate brush motor that restores crushed carpet piles. There are canister models with tanks that are mounted on castors and some that are held on the operators back. Canister models are preferred to reach difficult corners and edges. The value of the vacuum cleaner comes from the fact that it is quicker, requies less labour and raises no dust thus preventing dust from being deposited elsewhere in the room. When using the vacuum cleaner it must be checked for its functionality. When using it over carpets it should be done crossways over the carpet to ensure that suction has time to draw out the dust and the grit. A regular movement is most effective and can be judged by feeling the pull against the carpet. The wire connecting the power socket should be straight as the coiling of wire could lead to unmanageable knots which may even fall under the suction. Small objects such as pins and needles that are sharp should be picked by hand otherwise the nozzle or suction tube could get damaged and the effectiveness of the suction could reduce. The dust bags of the vacuum cleaner must be cleaned daily or more depending upon the frequency of its usage. A vacuum cleaner with an empty bag provides greater suction than the one whose bag is full of dust. The bag may be emptied out into a newspaper or paper sack and kept with the rubbish. All brush attachments should be kept free from dust, bits of cotton and hair that are picked up in the course of cleaning.

A dustette is a small, light vacuum cleaner used for cleaning curtains, upholstery and mattresses. It cleans by brush and suction and is very easy to handle.

Wet Vacuums: This is a kind of vacuum that can suck water from floors or can have both suction and water sprayer to rinse the soiled area. Squeegee attachments on wet vacuums can make floor clean-up, stripping and scrubbing more efficient. Conventional vacuum cleaners must never be used to clean wet floors.  Wet vacuums come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some canister models can be dragged on castors while others can be strapped on the back of the cleaner. These vacuums have collection tanks that store the water that has

been sucked up from the floors. This equipment can be used on wet carpets as well. Some wet vacuums may be pushed like a cart and are heavier for large water suction needs off floors.

<!-- image -->

Wet Extractors: While  wet  vacuum  cleaners  have  a  suction  feature,  wet extractors  have  suction  and  water  injection  features.  With  this  they simultaneously rinse and suck water from the surface. They are best for both carpets and floors. The basic principle of operation is that the extractor sprays water and detergent onto the surface and then uses suction to extract the water into tanks built into the wet extractor. Some machines have agitators to loosen the dirt from the carpet before spraying. They have other attachments for draperies and upholstery as well. Wet extractors come in various shapes and sizes. They come in lighter portable tank versions, as well as the heavy

duty push-cart variety. They can be used for both floors and carpets. Some extractors can also have a feature for dry pick-up like normal vacuum cleaners.

Rotary Floor Machines: Rotary machines have several applications: to shampoo, polish and scrub. They can be used for both carpets and floors just by the change of an attachment. For example, the machine can be used for carpets by changing the bonnet block to bonnet brush.

## 336

Rotary machines can be fitted with pads for rotary spin pad cleaning, mist pad cleaning, bonnet pad shampoos, buffing, burnishing, scrubbing, stripping and refinish of a variety of floor finishes; or brushes to perform dry foam cleaning, or brush shampoos. Manufacturers provide a variety of pads for specific purposes. There are separate pads for stripping, scrubbing, polishing, burnishing and spray cleaning. Mechanical scrubbers are used on large uncarpeted floors after they have been washed with water and detergent. Scrubbers are used to clean any sticky grit on the floors. Mechanical polishers are used on large polished wood or vinyl floor surfaces. The floor must be swept clear of dust and mud marks. Polish is lightly rubbed onto the floor surface for the best results.

The machine has a feed-in tray for detergent solutions and tanks for water supply and water extraction. Rotary machines come at different speeds ranging from less than 175 rpm for carpets to 1500 rpm for burnishing and buffing of other surfaces.

## Use and Maintenance

All  machines especially rotary machines must be handled by trained and experienced people only. Improper use of the machines can cause such damage to carpets as seam separation, delamination of backing material, buckling, shrinking, premature face fibre wear. Such equipment comes with accessories and attachments like hoses and electrical cords. Hoses must be checked for perforation and leaks. They must be rinsed properly after use. Electrical cords must be checked for frayed insulation and naked wire. The plugs used must fit in the sockets well. Never put bare wire ends of cords into sockets as they involve hazards of electrocution and short circuits. Small objects like pins and needles must be removed with a brush and dustpan first before vacuum cleaning the carpet as these items tend to puncture the dust bag of the vacuum cleaner.

Any large object should also removed from the floor as it could damage the suction process. Suction nozzles should be facing downwards when vacuuming as other articles like jewellery, fine garments can be sucked in.

## 2. Containers

Containers are vital to cleaning. Following types of containers are primarily used in hotel industry

- l Buckets or pails for carrying water primarily. They come in plastic or galvanized metal.
- l Basins and bowls that are used for removing spots and stains. They usually come in plastic.
- l Dust pans for collecting dust by hand brushes. They come in plastic or galvanized metals.
- l Housemaid box which is a plastic carry case for various cleaning solutions, brushes and dusters.
- l Public refuse bins that come in chrome for internal use and galvanized metal for external use.
- l Waste bins that are used in guest rooms and bathrooms, offices and restaurants. They come in plastic. They must be lined with garbage bags of appropriate size for easy disposal of trash.
- l Mixing buckets for carrying detergent solutions.
- l Mop buckets on castors with a ringer attached.
- l Tanks for wet extractors and wet vacuum cleaners that collect water sucked up from floors by the machines.
- l Vacuum cleaner bags that collect the dust from floors and carpets.

## Use and Maintenance

Most containers are made of plastic these days for aesthetic appeal, lightness and easy maintenance. Containers must be cleaned everyday by gently rinsing them inside out. They must be dried before stacking. Buckets may be piled upside down. Tanks are of galvanized metal and must be cleaned thoroughly before and after use. Vacuum cleaner bags must be allowed to fill only to 2/ 3 rd of  its  capacity  should  be  cleaned out at this point. Vacuum bags must be emptied before storage. These equipments are wheel mounted. The wheels (or castors) must be welloiled for easy carriage. The wheels must be free of dust, tangled strings and hair, etc. Broken wheels must be replaced immediately to give the equipment maneuverability.

## 3. Brushes

Brushes are manufactured to fulfil a number of objectives. Brushes with soft fibre or nylon bristles are designed to brush carpets, cane, etc. without damaging the surfaces. Scrub brushes have short coarse bristles designed for use on surfaces which have become ingrained with dirt and stains. Following types of brusted are used for cleaning in hotel industry:

- (a) Toilet brush for cleaning WC and bidet bowls.
- (b) Sink brush that comes in wire for unclogging sink outlets.
- (c) Scrub brush for cleaning hard grime from floors.
- (d) Carpet hand brush fro cleaning carpets as an alternative to vacuum cleaners.
- (e) Tapestry brush for cleaning delicate draperies.
- (f) Cane chair brush which is a soft nylon brush that prevents damage to cane surfaces.
- (g) Soft hand brush to gather dust from various surfaces. It goes with a dustpan.
- (h) Wall brush has long handles to reach the upper corners and sides of walls. They are soft so as not to damage wall finishes,
- (i) Feather brush that is soft as a feather to clean delicate surfaces like lampshades, televisions, etc.

- (j) Nylon nap brush used to restore carpet pile after cleaning.
- (k) Hand shampoo brush used on stairs and edges.

## Use and Maintenance

Brushes must be free of fluff, hair and dust each day. Periodic washing is also recommended. Natural bristles tend to lose some of their stiffness if washed frequently but by giving the brushes a final rinse in salted cold water, the bristles regain their natural stiffness. Nylon brushes can be washed more easily and they dry quickly. In general, brushes must be washed with soap lather by working the bristles up and down in warm water and rinsed clean with cold water and dried in sun. Brushes that are worn by must be replaced 1/8 of an inch. They must be dry when stored and not placed on their bristles.

## 4. Mops and Brooms

Following types of different mops and brooms are required in hotels for cleaning floors.

- (a) Yard brooms with coarse bristles to clean rough floors and garden areas. They come with long handles to reduce fatigue over large areas and are hand held shorter ones for small areas.
- (b) Mops are used for dusting floors as well as cleaning the floors with water. They come in various sizes for different purposes.
- (c) Soft sweeping broom for internal areas to remove dust from floors and carpets.
- (d) Squeegee is a tool with a rubber blade, like a windshield wiper used for gathering and channelizing water. Squeegees are small hand held ones for window glazes and large ones for floors.

## Use and maintenance

In principle, soft bristled brooms are used on smooth floors while coarse-bristled ones are used on coarse surfaces, especially outside. Brooms are maintained in the same manner as brushes. Mops must be washed in hot soapy water or detergent (never both together). The use of soapless detergent will prevent the formation of scum. The mop should be tightly squeezed out by hand, shaken well in the open air and left to dry. Coarse cotton mops are used for large stone or cement floors.  It  takes  less  time  to  clean  than  hand  washing,  but  cannot  ensure  a  good  standard  of cleanliness. New mops must be soaked in clean water for 30 minutes to allow for shrinkage.

## 5. Cleaning Cloths

Following types of cleaning clothes are a neccessity in hotels:

- (a) Cloth dusters
- (b) Rags for applying polish
- (c) Flannelette cloth for polishing
- (d) Chamois leather
- (e) Glass cloth
- (f) Floor dusters
- (g) Faucet Duster

## 9.2 CLEANING METHODS

## Introduction

One of the main functions of housekeeping is to clean various surfaces in a hotel. We will see in the charts below, the types of surfaces that are used in hotel interiors. We will be surprised by its number. Over the years various methods have been tried and tested by housekeepers. The methods given below  are  the  traditional  ones.  With  the  advancement  of  science  and technology we now have ready mix solutions for cleaning available in the local supermarket. A housekeeper will have to visit the market and assess the brands available in their own locales. One must take care that these brands are always available. The traditional methods, given below, use items

<!-- image -->

that are commonly available. This gives housekeepers greater freedom when certain modern brands are not available. The choice of cleaning method depends on various factors as listed as follows:

- 1. The nature of soil.
- 2. The nature of the surface that is soiled
- 3. The properties of cleaning agents suitable for the surface.
- 4. The best way to clean without dispersing dust to other areas
- 5. Cost effectiveness in terms of materials and labour time
- 6. The method should restore the surface to its original sheen and colour.

While the methods used have to be viewed individually, depending upon the surface, there are some general principles that can be applied to all cleaning:

- 1. All loose dust and litter should be removed before the start of cleaning procedures, for stubborn stains and grime.
- 2. Use lighter cleaning methods first before attempting stronger methods
- 3. Duster cloths and linen used must be clean and dry before using them.
- 4. When in doubt, choose the simplest methods.
- 5. Use abrasives as a last resort as they can damage the surface.
- 6. Use an agent that is the least offensive in smell if alternatives are available.
- 7. Be cautious  not  to  spoil  the  surrounding  areas  when  cleaning  a  surface,  e.g.  leaving fingerprints on walls, grazing other articles.
- 8. Use methods that pose least inconvenience to guests. Guests can be disturbed by noise, smell or cleaning materials lying loosely in public areas.
- 9. Be sure that during the process of cleaning, areas do not become accident prone, e.g. wet floors, greasy surfaces, obstacles in the way, etc.
- 10. Cleaning should be carefully planned so as to ensure the least time.
- 11. Cleaning should be periodic to ensure a sparkling house.
- 12. All the staff must be properly trained in cleaning methods and the use of cleaning agents e.g. use of gloves, masks, etc.

One of the crucial items in any cleaning is water. The role of water is:

- 1. To hold the dirt and remove it away as in rinsing.
- 2. To react with the dirt and grease, break it down and hold it in suspension. This is done with the aid of detergents.

## 344

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

- 3. To emulsify and hold grease in suspension together with the dirt so that it can be removed. The use of alkalis helps in the process.

With these principles in mind we are ready to tackle the cleaning of various surfaces given below.

## Floors

Floors in this section refer to those other than carpets, which will be discussed in detail in a later section. Floors have their advantages and disadvantages. They are more durable, sanitary and do not create static electricity. They are ideal where one can expect heavy traffic of people, equipment and vehicles. They are less vulnerable to moisture and do not breed micro organisms like carpets do. They are, therefore, preferred in

<!-- image -->

moisture prone areas like bathrooms, kitchens and laundries. However, their disadvantages are many. They are nosier and cannot be used where one expects sound absorption like guest rooms or meeting rooms. Wet surfaces can be slippery and therefore, a hazard to guests and personnel. It may appear that they are easier to maintain than carpets. This is not so. They require constant mopping, sweeping and occasionally buffing and waxing.

Basically, there are three types of floors:

Hard Floors

Wood Floors

Resilient Floors

Hard Floors are made from stone or clay. They include concrete, marble, granite, terrazzo, ceramic tiles and natural stone. They are the most durable of all floors. Hotels will use concrete in drive ways, porches, car parks, stewarding, laundry, etc where heavy traffic is expected. Marble,

<!-- image -->

terrazzo and granite come in many colours and give a grand finish to surfaces. They are, therefore, preferred for counter tops, decorative walls, and select lobby floors. They come in glossy finish or mat finish to suit the décor style. They do not care to retain their gloss. They are, however, expensive as they  have  to  be  quarried  and  finished  in  size  and  face,  for commercial use. Terrazzo is made from small chips of marble

and bound together to give an attractive look. Ceramic tile is made from a combination of marble, clay, slate, glass or flint. It is very durable and easy to maintain. Slate comprises the natural stone and comes in slices. It is used for roofing and heavy flooring.

Wood floors are differentiated between hard woods and soft woods. Teak, ebony, and maple are hard woods that are very expensive. They are used for furniture mostly and for exclusive floors. Oak wood is cheaper and therefore, chosen for wooden flooring. Soft woods such as pine and cork are used where a springy tread is preferred; but they create dents and scratches. Other variants of wood flooring are parquets floors that are wood tiles of maple and oak usually. Wood

blocks resemble butcher cutting blocks but come in tiles. They are used where heavy wear and tear is expected. Wooden planks come in varying sizes and can be used for flooring. The chopping of wood has been controlled in many states because of fears of deforestation and therefore, it is difficult to get wood for large scale use. Care must be taken to purchase them from legitimate sources. Wood flooring is, therefore, used only for decorative purposes as in bars and lounges.

<!-- image -->

Resilient floors are  springy  and  therefore,  used  extensively.  They  include vinyl, asphalt, rubber and linoleum. Vinyl surfaces can be protected with wax for heavy use and therefore, used extensively. Since they are non-porous and sound absorbent, they are the preferred flooring. Vinayl floors come in many

<!-- image -->

colours.  Asphalt  flooring  is  resistant  to  decay  and mildew and is fire resistant. They are used on driveways and  rooftops.  Rubber  flooring  is  used  in  areas  that require sound absorption. They act as good underlay to conference halls and restaurants. Rubber is, however,

<!-- image -->

expensive  and  since  they  are  susceptible  to  fire  they  are  least  used. Linoleum flooring is the most popular in this category. Linoleum floors are cheap in cost and come in many colours. Linoleum is made from linseed oil, ground cork or wood, mineral fillers and resins. They may have a felt backing for extra spring. While linoleum is easy to maintain, it  cannot  take  heavy  traffic  and  wears  easily.  It  is  not  used  in  luxury settings.

The chart below gives the cleaning methods employed for each type of surface:

## White Metals

White metals are alloys of different types of metals. Hard metals like iron and steel are used as building materials to give construction strength. White metals are more decorative and malleable to be able to give it the shapes required for hotel use; For example, stainless steel requires the combination of steel, nickel and chromium. Kitchens use stainless steel a lot for table tops and utensils. Their cleaning is under kitchen stewarding and not under the housekeeping however. Housekeepers find metals in the form of brassware for lamps and flower pots, chrome for interiors of elevators, cast iron for banister railings, etc. Given below are the different types of metals, commonly used in hotel interiors, that is cleaned by housekeeping departments:

| Type of Metal                                                                                               | Items Required                                                                                      | Stain Remover                                            | Method of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Rubbing-up                                                                         | Remarks                                                                |

## Furniture

<!-- image -->

Furniture  consists  of  beds,  tables,  chairs,  cabinets,  etc.  It  is necessary for living  comforts  and  convenience. Furniture is a means of beautifying rooms and is an integral part of themes of restaurants, lobbies and rooms. Furniture is expensive because they are mostly made of wood. There are alternatives nowadays

in glass, metal, plastic and other materials shown in the chart below. Most hotels opt for wooden furniture that last longer than any other type. When one considers the investment in furniture to fill guest rooms, lobbies, restaurants and bars, etc. consideration should be given to their longevity and upkeep when purchasing them. The choice of furniture is made by the interior designer at the inception of the hotel.  Furniture can range from the classical Louis XIV furniture to the practical Scandinavian  assembled  types.  Once  bought,  they  have  to  be maintained so as to prolong the use of this asset. The chart below

<!-- image -->

gives the type of wood and how they are maintained. While Lesson 5.1, Layout of a Guest Room and Amenities gives in detail the furniture found in a room, public areas also have an array of furniture for understanding:

<!-- image -->

Lobbies &amp; Foyers: Have lounge sofas and chairs with centre tables; corner tables for flower decorations and artifacts; lobby manager and GREs desks and  chairs;  bell  and  concierge  desks;  and reception counters.

Restaurants: Have  tables  and  chairs; sideboards;  buffet  tables;  mobile  bars;  and display counters.

Bars &amp; Cocktail Lounges: Have  lounge  chairs  with  centre

tables; bottle display cabinets and units; and the main bar counter.

Function Rooms: Have chairs and folding tables; corner tables for displays; bandstand; dais; lecterns; and reception counters.

<!-- image -->

Offices: Have desks and chairs, cabinets; cadenzas; and tables for office equipment.

Patios, balconies and Terraces: Have outdoor chairs and tables.

Swimming Pool: Poolside loungers; pool tables and chairs; and wooden hampers for wet towels.

## Ceilings &amp; Walls

Nowadays, there is a variety of ceiling and wall surface finishes. They include wood, carpet, wall paper, fabric, stone, marble, granite, ceramic tiles and the most commonpaint. Wood comes

<!-- image -->

in the form of plyboard for partitions and wood panels. This is used for offices, function rooms and wood specific log chalets. Wood gives a cosy and exclusive ambience. Their upkeep is done by polishing the wood; applying varnish when stains arise; or just by plain dusting with a cloth or feather duster. Luxury hotels have gone extensively into stone, granite and marble wall finishes especially for exterior surfaces and lobbies. They are more durable and give a rich look to a  property.  They  can  be  washed,  mopped  and  scrubbed  to  maintain  the

freshness. Ceramic tiles are extensively used in bathrooms, kitchens, receiving areas, laundries and pool sides. They are most effective where surfaces are exposed to water. Tiles can be washed with soap solutions and mopped dry.

as the cheapest and most durable surface finish. Painted surfaces can be touched up or re-painted

We will find wall paper in smaller traditional properties especially the bed and breakfast variety. They come in many designs and colours. Wall paper can be dusted daily with a feather duster. They have the danger of staining or guests leaving dirty imprints. Wall paper in rooms in busy hotels will require constant changing. The challenge is whether the particular design is available all the time or not. Paint by far is the most popular surface finish. With the advance of technology, there are paints to suit every kind of environment and budget. There is the plastic emulsion paint that can be washed easily and is resistant to wind, air and dust. Most guest rooms and public areas are painted whenever the need arises.

Vinyl manufacturers have introduced revolutionary ceiling and wall finishes. They come in attractive colours and designs. They are a viable alternative to paint. The product is made by laminating vinyl to  a  cotton  or  polycotton  backing.  Polycotton  backing  is  less flammable  and  more  durable  than  cotton;  it  is,  therefore,  most preferred. Vinyl comes in rolls and pasted onto the wall with a special adhesive.  It  is  mounted  on  ceilings  and  walls  by  specialists.  The challenge to housekeepers is the growth of mildew in wet climates. Mildew loosens the vinyl from the adhesive creating ripples in the vinyl. Vinyl can be scrubbed with brushes and soap solutions and even stronger detergents. The manufacturers are the best to suggest

<!-- image -->

the appropriate cleaning agent for the particular vinyl chosen. Fabric surfaces naturally are the most luxurious looking but they are difficult to install, hard to maintain and easily damaged. They are also very expensive. Fabric surface finishes come in cotton, wool and silks. Sometimes two or more materials are combined to give it a unique appearance. Fabric wall coverings may be paper or acrylic backed. Acrylic backed fabric backing is preferred as it wrinkles less and easier to install. Fabric surfaces are vacuumed regularly and stains and spots removed by conventional methods used on fabrics.

Basic principles of cleaning ceilings and walls are:

- 1. Check with the manufacturer for the best cleaning solution for the surface.
- 2. Check cleaning solutions that are multipurpose for a wide variety of surfaces.
- 3. Choose nontoxic, biodegradable and odourless chemicals that are safe for guests.
- 4. Choose safe equipment like ladders and scaffolds. It is preferable that they do not have to use them by having mops and sprays with long handles to reach vents and corners.
- 5. Furniture, carpets and fixtures must be covered with discarded linen before cleaning ceilings and walls.
- 6. It is preferable to use suction equipment than scrubbing ones to prevent any damage and scrapes to the surfaces.

## Windows

<!-- image -->

Windows are essential features of hotel construction. They come in all shapes and sizes from the small windows of bathrooms to bay-windows in guest rooms. Today there are reliable glass cleaning detergents  found  in  the  supermarket  that  can  be  sprayed  and cleaned  with  hand  held  squeegees.  Exterior  cleaning  of  glaze windows is a specialist job often given to contractors. It involves suspending carriages from the roof by cables for cleaners to access the windows from the outside. It is a hazardous job and the specialists know the precautions required for a safe operation.

Windows are incomplete without the shades to give privacy and protect interiors from sunlight. Window shades come in different materials including vinyl blinds to fabric curtains. Window coverings attract dust and pollutants like cigarette smoke. Vinyl blinds must be dusted daily with a feather duster. They can also be washed with soap solutions. Vinyl blinds are used in offices and low cost guest rooms. Drapes are preferred in hotels because they are sound absorbent and give a luxurious look. Drapes can be cleaned with special drape vacuum cleaners. All curtains in the hotel must be listed for period dry-cleaning and washing. This poses a challenge for the housekeeper as she has to make that area unavailable for use. If the area is revenue

<!-- image -->

generating, like guest rooms, food outlets and function rooms, the task gets more critical. The housekeeper will either have a spare set to hang or choose those lean times in a week or year to

<!-- image -->

close  down those areas for spring cleaning. The housekeeper must make sure at the time of purchase that the window fabrics can be maintained easily and inexpensively. Some fabrics do not respond well to washing, spotting or vacuuming.  These  need  to  be  tested  before  they  are  subjected  to  such treatment. Drapes can fade, lose colour, or shrink. The best fabrics chosen for hotels are those that can be washed. Nowadays windows are lined with cotton fabric to save them from exposure to sunlight resulting in the fabric becoming brittle or losing colour. Linings must be pre-shrunk before they are sewn onto curtains. It is prudent to dry clean such curtains to prevent further shrinkage.

The manner in which windows are hung or opened poses a problem to housekeepers. They are either hung on curtain rings along curtain rods or by curtain hooks that move along channels. Daily cleaners need to check that these are secure and send a maintenance request for defective ones. A window shade that cannot open prevents daily guest room cleaning that requires the room attendant to open it for airing the room.

Upmarket hotels  also  provide  sheer  curtains  as  a  back-up  to  heavy curtains. These curtains are meant to let the sunlight in during the day, while heavy drapery is drawn for the night, mainly to give privacy to the room occupants.

## Carpets

Carpets are expensive assets to hotels. They feature in capital budgets as owners treat them as investments that will serve the hotel for long periods. Care is taken in the selection and the laying

<!-- image -->

of carpets in guest rooms and public areas. The decision to purchase carpets is made by a senior committee which includes the General Manager, Investor, Interior  Decorator  and  the  Executive  Housekeeper.  Decisions  on  carpets have a longstanding impact; Hence it is important that such decisions are correct ones. The main considerations are durability, appearance and ease of  maintenance.  Since  floor  coverings,  cleaning  agents  and  maintenance equipment keep improving each year, those responsible for their purchase, primarily the Executive Housekeeper, has to survey the market frequently. For example, they may select equipment that has dual use on carpets and floors. Being valuable assets their care and maintenance have to be regular and follow the correct procedure.

## Types of Carpets

Carpets serve many purposes: (a) They give the area a plush look; (b) they are sound absorbent and so ideal for guest rooms, meeting rooms and offices; (c) they keep rooms warm and are valuable in cold climates; and (d) They prevent slipping and therefore, are preferred in corridors and stairs apart from rooms.

Primarily carpets have three considerations: the pile, the material it is mounted on and the base that supports the woven structure.

The pile is the main finish of the carpet which gives the carpet its distinction and also determines the type of carpet. It is the surface which is visible and what we walk on. The carpets pile is judged by its density (how close the fibres are knitted); height of the pile (how thick the pile is); twist (the strength of each pile fibre) and weave of the pile (how it is knitted together). This determines its durability, look and maintenance standards.

Height of the pile indicates the luxury of the carpet. The greater the height of the pile, the more plush it will look.

The density of the carpet gives its durability. Carpets with good density are less likely to be crushed under foot pressure. A good density of the carpets prevents soil and stains from lodging deep inside the pile by retaining them on the surface. The density is determined by seeing the back of the carpet and ascertaining the tightness with which the fibres are knitted together. The more closer the knitting, the denser is the pile. Another way to check density is to determine the weight of pile per square yard of carpet. The greater the weight, the more durable is the carpet.

The twist of fibres determines the quality of the carpet. The tighter the twist, the more resilient the carpet will be.

The weave is determined by how the fibres are mounted on the primary surface. This surface can be jute or synthetic material such as polypropylene. Jute backings are durable but catch mildew under damp conditions. Polypropylene has the same properties as jute but is mildew resistant. The primary backing is laced below with a bonding material such as rubber, latex or plastic that prevents the knots of the fibres from getting loose in transportation and installation.

Basically there are four categories of carpets:

- 1. Woollen carpets have the largest piles. Their colours hold faster and they have a luxurious feeling. Understandably they are the most expensive. They are water responsive and therefore, suitable for wet cleaning. However, they breed microorganisms such as moulds, mildew, bacteria and other growths that can spoil the carpet and can cause odours. They are not highly inflammable and absorb sound well. They are ideal for guest rooms and luxury hotels in general. In

<!-- image -->

terms of cleaning, they are picky, therefore, strong detergents like ammonia, salts, alkaline soaps and chlorine bleach must be avoided.

<!-- image -->

- 2. Cotton carpets are not as resistant as woollen carpets. Their colour fades faster. They are inexpensive and therefore, do not have that luxurious look. They do not absorb sound well. This type is not recommended for superior hotels but economical for student hostels and budget hotels.
- 3. Synthetic carpets are widely used nowadays in hotels. They, however, are highly inflammable and a hazard in a crisis. They are durable and flexible in design and construction. They hold their shape and retain colour

well. They can be dyed well into other colours. They absorb sound. In terms of cleaning, they are resistant to stains and soil than wool. They resist micro organisms and therefore, can be treated for moulds, mildew, bacteria, etc. Synthetic category of carpets include nylon, which cleans easily and is less expensive; acrylic, which may look like wool but is less easy to clean and less resilient; polypropylene, which is more

<!-- image -->

sturdy and resistant to strong cleaning solutions, however wears easily; polyesters that look like wool and are durable, clean easily and come in endless rolls and therefore, have the advantage of being fitted to any room size, however, they wear easily; Acetate, which is a cost-effective silky fibre that fast in colour and resistant  to mildew, but wears easily and can get damaged with strong detergents; and Rayon, which has poor resistance to soil and abrasion but has colour retention and resistance to mildew.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Silk carpets are very expensive and delicate and therefore, they are used only in special rooms. They do not last long but are luxurious looking. It is better to use them as throw rugs in suites and deluxe rooms. The best of them are Persian rugs and Cashmere rugs. They have fast colours and absorb sound well. They have less resistance as the piles are smaller than those of woolen carpets. They can be shampooed well and are resistant to bacteria.

## Laying of a Carpet

This activity is a specialised job and trusted to carpet specialists. When laying the carpet, it is important to scrub, wash and dry the floor to be carpeted.  Spray  the  floor,  particularly  skirting  and  corners  with pesticide. Mop up the excess pesticide on the floor and ensure that it is completely dry. Roll out the underlay which is of rubberized choir and cut and fit corners and skirting. The underlay should be half inch thick in rooms and quarter inch thick in corridors. The underlay is chosen with as much care as the carpet itself. The underlay prolongs the life of the carpet. It also provides sound absorption, insulation,

<!-- image -->

prevents carpet slippage and gives that extra cushionlike feeling. In areas where there is heavy equipment traffic, it is recommended to have thinner underlay. Carpets should be pre-measured and cut to size, rolled out with carpet grippers to avoid puckering and fitted well into the desired area.  Raw  edges  are  blanket  stitched  to  give  a  neat  appearance  as  well  as  to  avoid  fraying. Modern carpeting does away with the underlay and can be directly glued onto the floor.

## Carpet Cleaning

The main objective of carpet cleaning is to give carpets a long life. Since this one item is so expensive, it is treated as an asset that deserves a special care. Housekeepers are advised to have an annual carpet maintenance programme. Such a programme will have the following elements:

- 1. Daily inspection and cleaning: All carpets are vacuumed or brushed daily especially where there is heavy traffic. Daily inspection also locates spots and stains that have occurred

in the last 24 hours. The spots and stains must be attended to immediately so that they do not become permanent.

- 2. Weekly cleaning scheduling: These schedules go beyond just vacuuming. It could include carpet shampooing; spot cleaning and stain removal.
- 3. Preventive maintenance: The  best  way  to  give  carpets  a  longer  life  is  to  execute  a preventive maintenance programme. It is better to forestall damage than respond to it. Carpets should be shampooed periodically; aired to be kept dry to avoid mildew; furniture moved so that they do not create permanent indents on the carpets; underlay should be provided to protect carpets from surface water seepage and pests; pest control programmes runner and mats should be used in heavy traffic areas; and regular vacuuming of carpets should be done.

Carpet cleaning is done by several methods:

Dry Vacuuming Method: The vacuum cleaner is the main machine in this category. It has the advantage of sucking dust from between piles. It also lifts piles, levels them in one movement, and removes dust completely. Some modern vacuum cleaners have a combination floor nozzle that give the advantage of cleaning floors as well as carpets at the drop of a switch. Whenever one uses the nozzle for carpets, he has to move against the pile first and then along the pile  to  remove  hidden soil  lodged  inside  the  carpet  piles.  Use  smooth  brisk movements with downward pressure for smoothening and positioning the piles. Care must be taken to empty out the vacuum cleaner dust bag every time the cleaning  of  a  few  rooms  is  completed  to  avoid  dust  congestion  in  the  bag. Congestion stops the suction.

<!-- image -->

Hot Water Extraction: Hot water extraction is sometimes referred to as steam cleaning. Actually this is a misnomer as real steam on carpets is too dry and hot to clean the carpet properly. In this method, hot cleaning solution is sprayed under pressure onto the carpet and is immediately extracted with a vacuum source. The dirty solution is collected in a recovery tank and is flushed into the waste water system of the hotel. The advantage of this method is that it has the ability to flush large amounts of contaminants out of the carpet. It is the most preferred method and has the deepest cleaning action most suited to carpets with thick piles.

Shampooing: This method involves wetting the carpet and shampooing it. The equipment used is a motorized circular brush that injects cleaning solution at pressure into carpets that loosens and seeks the dirt out. The resultant dirt solution may be sucked from the surface. This method relies on vacuuming after the shampoo dries. This method is quick but does not clean all the dirt lodged deep inside piles. It is, therefore, not recommended for thick piled carpets. This method provides very good agitation and is best suited for low commercial carpets or low cut pile carpets that are highly soiled.

## Carpet Shampooing Procedure

- 1. Remove carpet from the room and spread it upside down on an open concrete surface.
- 2. Beat out dust in slow motion with a carpet beater so as to cover all areas of the carpet at least three times.
- 3. Roll the carpet and remove loose dust from the surface underneath with a soft broom.

## 358

- 4. Roll out carpet with the correct side up.
- 5. Apply shampoo with the shampoo machine using slow circular motions. A carpet specialist will prescribe the correct brands suited for the carpet. Readymade shampoos are available in the market.
- 6. Extra shampoo foam is removed with the carpet brush.
- 7. The carpet is left in the sun to dry.

Bonnet Method (Dry Cleaning): This method is another wet cleaning method with a difference. It injects the cleaning solution mist into the carpet in the form of a spray and allows the carpet to soak the solution for a short while. It is then buffed with a rotary machine with absorbent pad that agitates the surface of the pile. Pads are made of synthetic or natural fibres and can be laundered and reused. The method has the advantage of drying very quickly because of the small amount of moisture used. It generally does a good job of cleaning of the top one third of the carpet visible to the naked eye. But it does very little to the grit and sand lodged deep in the pile that damage the carpet over time. Because there is no flushing action or extraction, there is very little deep cleaning involved. This method may be considered as an interim cleaning between more effective cleanings.

Dry  Foam  Method: This  method  is  very  similar  to  shampooing  in  that  it  relies  on  the aggressiveness of the brushing action, which is done by counter rotating cylindrical brushes. The method uses a high foam shampoo detergent with less liquid. It is applied by a rotary machine with a brush that suspends soils and emulsifies oils. The resultant liquid on the carpet is sucked out by a wet vacuum cleaner. Like shampooing it is not a suitable method for thick pile carpets.

Manual Method: This is a method using the carpet brush and dust pan. It is recommended to brush against the piles to make stand. This gives a springy feeling when one treads on the carpet. Use brisk movements between piles to scoop out dust. Collect the dust in dustpans and empty it in garbage bags after cleaning the carpets in every room. Carpet brushing is preferred to noisy vacuum

<!-- image -->

cleaners to avoid disturbance to sleeping guests especially in the night and early mornings.

Dry Powder Cleaning Method: In this method dry powder or crystals are sprinkled on the carpet and worked into the pile with a hand brush. The powder absorbs soils and is later removed by vacuuming the carpet surface. This method is ideal for high traffic areas that cannot be obstructed for long periods of time.

## Special Points for Carpet Cleaning

Carpets can be a housekeepers nightmare. Firstly, they are such expensive assets that owners expect them to last from 7 to 10 years. Secondly, they are highly visible and therefore, have to be as fresh and clean as possible over the years. Thirdly, carpet cleaning requires shutting down those areas for business leading to a loss of revenue. The task of keeping them clean becomes challenging by the amount of traffic on them and the stains, drips and spills that occur daily due to the traffic. Then, in wet weathers carpets, especially those with natural fibres, are breeding grounds for microorganisms like germs, bacteria, moulds, spores, mildew and dust mites. This challenge can be met by following some simple tips:

- 1. When cleaning carpets pay attention to corners and under edges of carpets as dust normally collects there.

## LESSON  9 Cleaning -Knowledge and Practice

- 2. Install mats at entrances so that guests can rub away their dirt from outside before entering the carpeted areas.
- 3. Vacuum daily using the special features of various vacuum machines to serve their range of purposes.
- 4. Prepare  a  weekly  and  monthly  preventive  maintenance programme for the upkeep of carpets.

## Storage of Carpets

It is recommended that carpets should not be stored. However, due to unavoidable reasons such as room renovations; closing of a resort facility during off season, etc., the housekeeper is faced with the problem of storing carpets. Following procedure may be followed:

- 1. The room must be properly pest controlled every third day. It should be a dry place.

## 360

- 2. Carpets being stored for long durations must be opened out on a flat concrete surface as pests cannot cut through it.
- 3. However, if due to shortage of space carpets have to be rolled, they should be opened every second day to air them as well as permit the piles to retain their natural flow.
- 4. Rolled up carpets must be wrapped with discarded linen or polythene sheets.

## Carpet Problems

A  professional  housekeeper  has  to  know  the  problems  she  will  face  while maintaining the several square yards of carpets in the hotel. These problems may be classified as follows:

<!-- image -->

## Pile Problems

Piles which are the visible face of the fibres on the surface can get twisted, pilled, crushed, flared or matted. This is caused in areas of heavy footfall or equipment traffic. Piles can be distorted when aggressive cleaning methods are used. To avoid this it is recommended to use runners (strips of heavy duty cloth) along the carpet to prevent crushing. Regular vacuuming or using pile lifters and carpet rakes can resolve the situation to some extent. These aid the pile to remain erect.

## Shading

This occurs when carpet piles are brushed in two different directions giving the carpet separate colours. It is a normal feature and some housekeepers may keep reversing the pile brush to give the carpet different colours. The only way to maintain a common colour is to vacuum or brush the carpet in one direction only.

## Fading

Fading of colour is caused by natural aging of the carpet; exposure to sunlight on a regular basis; or by improper cleaning. To protect the carpet from this phenomenon the housekeeper must ensure regular cleaning and keep carpets away from direct sunlight. Carpets in heavy traffic areas are bound to have their degree of wear and can only be given longer life through regular cleaning. Another reason for fading is  the  use  of  strong  solutions  for  removing  spots  and  stains.  It  is recommended that the carpet should be pre-tested for its reaction to cleaning solutions before their use on it. This can be done by applying the solution to one small corner of the carpet or on cut samples retained just for this purpose. However, if fading does take place there are professional dyers who can bring to the carpet some degree of freshness.

## Browning

Browning (or wicking) happens when the colour of the backing of a wet carpet is absorbed by the fibre and as a result brown patches appear on the surface. This phenomenon happens mostly with jute backed carpets. Browning can be resolved by adding vinegar or synthetic citric acid to cleaning solutions. It is prudent to check with the manufacturer or carpet experts about the use of these or any new chemicals. Carpets must be pre-tested before the general application of solutions.

## Mildew

Mildew is a microorganism that grows especially in natural fibres that are exposed to wet and humid conditions. Mildew causes staining, odour and rotting. Carpets must always be kept dry especially after a wet treatment like shampooing.

## Pilling

Pilling is caused when pieces of face fibre are trapped in the carpet at the time of manufacturing. These pieces come to the surface when the carpet is trod upon. It seems that the carpet is shedding its fibres when in fact it is only the residual fibres caught in the pile which are coming to the surface. This gives the carpet an unkempt look. Frequent initial vacuuming sucks these pieces out of the pile and also collect loose fibres on the surface. Another painstaking method is to pick and cut these loose fibres with scissors.

## 9.3 CLEANING AGENTS

## Introduction

Cleaning agents are perhaps the most critical aids of housekeeping staff in their job to keep a sparkling house. Basically the cleaning process is carried out to remove dust and dirt. While normal dusting with a cloth or vacuum cleaner removes loose dust, cleaning agents would be required when dust becomes grit and is stubborn to remove.

Some of the common agents used are:

## Water

Water is probably the most common and widely used agent as it is freely available. It is useful in rinsing and finishing of cleaning processes. Precaution must be taken to change dirty water with fresh water because it could leave a film of dirt instead of removing it. Warm water dissolves soap more readily than cold water; hence it must be used to remove dirty soap lather.  Water is of two types, hard water and soft water. Soft water is best for cleaning. Hardness in water is caused by the presence of mineral salts  mostly calcium (Ca) and magnesium (mg), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). The mineral salts react with soap to form an insoluble precipitate known as soap film or scum. The result is that the soap film does not rinse away easily. It tends to remain behind and produces visible deposits on clothing making it stiff. It attaches to the insides of bathtubs and sinks. Caution must be taken that the water is soft as no detergent is effective with hard water. Moreover, hard water does not wet the surface well as a precondition for good cleaning action.

## Liquid Cleaning Agents

While in modern days we have one or two multi-purpose cleaning agents, it is useful to know some traditional liquid cleaning agents. Liquid cleaning agents can either be diluted in a little water or used directly with a dry cloth.

Ammonia is an alkali made up of one part nitrogen and three parts hydrogen. It is highly soluble and forms a solution called ammonium hydroxide (liquid ammonia). It is not too active when dry, but reacts with many chemicals in liquid form. It softens hard water and emulsifies grease.

Methylated spirits are derived from methanol, a type of alcohol used for industrial purposes. It is also called methyl alcohol or wood alcohol. It is flammable and highly poisonous.  It has to be handled with extreme care. It reacts with various substances and is effective against grease stains.

Paraffin is a white, partly clear, waxy solid that has no odour or taste. Paraffin forms a moisture proof film on surfaces.  It is also grease solvent.

Turpentine is a colourless with a strong odour. It is highly inflammable. It is used as a thinner for paints and varnishes. As a cleaning agent, it is grease and paint solvent which means that it ideal for removing paint and grease stains.

Vinegar is a sour liquid derived from wine-making. The French call it sour wine . While vinegars use  in  food  preservation  and  salads  is  wellknown,  its  commercial  use  has  found  its  way  to housekeeping cleaning chores.  It  acts  as  a  mild  acid  unaffected  by  hard  water  and  useful  in removing light stains in baths.

## 364

Hydrochloric acid is useful in removing stains in bathrooms. Care must be taken in its use as it can burn the skin and destroy fabrics and light bathroom fittings.

Carbon tetrachloride is also excellent grease solvent. Care must be exercised in its use as its fumes are harmful.

## Washing Soda

This agent is vastly outdated due to the advent of innovative detergents like vim, etc. However, it is particularly useful for emulsifying grease on drain pipes, gutters or stone surfaces. In a strong concentration it could be injurious to skin, fabrics, brushes, wood and paint. Washing soda is useful as a water softener.

## Soda-bars, Powders, Flakes

Today soaps have been replaced by excellent synthetic soapless detergents which are unaffected by hard water. In this case rinsing is not important as these products suspend dirt and grit most effectively without leaving a smear. However, some housekeepers may not have access to these detergents and may have to rely on soaps.

Powders and flakes are useful in getting instant lather but are expensive. When used, care should be taken that they are thoroughly dissolved. Being expensive, one should know exactly how much powder or flake should be dissolved to get an optimum benefit as also how long the resultant solution would be effective. Good bar soaps are still most economical but much more strenuous than modern methodologies. They should be stored on open shelves in a dry store.

## Abrasives

Abrasives are substances used to grind, smoothen, sharpen, and polish various materials. Common abrasives include alumina, emery, pumice, sand and silicon carbide. They are used in cases of very stubborn stains on various surfaces. Silver, sand, steel wool, glass paper may be used for removing stains on plain wood, stone or cement floors. Emery powder or paper is suitable for removing rust from steel. Pumice powder is used for removing stains from sinks and bath tubs. Whiting is a mild abrasive for cleaning white paint. Nylon scourers are made to have an abrasive effect and yet prove less damaging to surfaces.

## Polishes

Polishes fall into three types  liquid polishes, pastes and creams. These fall primarily into three broad categories  spiritbased, oilbased and waterbased. Spiritbased polishes are used for metal mirrors, window panes and bakelite. Oilbased polishes are used for stained, wax polish or painted wood, linoleum and synthetic floorings with an oil or resinous base, cork or wood waste, leather and leather substitutes, enameled tiles and lacquered metals. Waterbased polishes are used on sealed floors, thermoplastic floors and rubber flooring.

There are some basic principles applied in using polishes. They are:

- 1. Polish should be used only after dirt and dust on surfaces have been thoroughly removed.
- 2. Polish must be used in small quantities as excessive polish could smear surfaces.
- 3. Polish should only be used as a last resort.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Polish should be rubbed off thoroughly as surfaces could then become sticky or greasy and thus show finger marks when touched.
- 5. Surfaces provided with permanent or semi-permanent polish sheens must be polished very carefully as the original sheen could be destroyed.

## Examples are:

- (a) Wax polish must not be applied to french polished surfaces.
- (b) Wax polish must not be applied to a floor treated with a shellac dressing (which is a semipermanent polish).
- (c) Metal polish must not be applied to chromium-plated or lacquered metals.
- (d) Polishes are expensive, therefore, they must be stored correctly and controlled in use.
- (e) Polishing of floors is more economically done by polishing machines.

## General Principles in Selection of Cleaning Agents

- 1. Use mild rather than strong agents as they are less injurious to surfaces.
- 2. Purity of sample is also important. There are cheap substitutes that might show immediate results but in a long run may damage surfaces as they are likely to contain strong chemicals and abrasives.
- 3. Buy polishes in manageable containers as bulk purchases could cause congestion in stores. The containers must have reliable lids, corks, etc. as defective ones could result in wastage due to evaporation and drying.
- 4. Multi-purpose  polishes  could  save  managing  too  many  polishes  which  requires  more supervision.
- 5. Strong smelling agents (e.g. paraffin) must be avoided due to the offensive smells they lend to the environment.

## 9.4 PEST CONTROL

## Introduction

Pest control is a programme of eradicating pests. Pests are removed through pesticides. A pesticide is a chemical used to control or eliminate pests. Insects are probably the lajor pests. Many kinds of insects transmit diseases, such as malaria and typhus. Some insects destroy or cause heavy damage to valuable vegetation. Other common pests include bacteria, fungi, rats and such weeds as poison ivy and ragweed. Manufacturers use various chemicals in making pesticides.

## Types of Pesticide

Pesticides are classified according to the pests they control. The four most widely used types of pesticides are:

- l Insecticides
- l Herbicides
- l Fungicides

<!-- image -->

- l Rodenticides

Insecticides: Hotel gardeners use insecticides to protect their plants from insect damage. Public health officials use these chemicals to fight mosquitoes and other insects. Insecticides are used in hotels to control such pests as ants, flies, moths, cockroaches and termites.

Herbicides: These chemicals are used to control weeds or other unwanted plants. Herbicides are used by hotel gardeners to reduce weeds, crab grass and dandelions among their plants. Herbicides are also used in recreational areas like gardens, ponds and lakes.

Fungicides: Certain fungus are pathogenic (disease causing) and may infect plants, animals and human beings. Fungicides are sprayed or dusted to kill fungal growths like rusts, mildew, smuts and molds. Fabrics are treated with fungicides to prevent rotting. Most disinfectants used in hotels use fungicides.

<!-- image -->

Rodenticides: these chemicals are used chiefly in areas infested with rats and other rodents which are a health hazard.  Rats carry diseases such as rabies, rat bite fever,  tularemia and typhus. Rats also destroy food and grain in hotel dry stores. Rodenticides help in eliminating such pests in prone areas of the hotel like kitchens and stores.

## Use of Pesticides

Pesticides differ according to their effects on various organisms. Selective pesticides are toxic only to the target pests. These are largely preferred in hotels. They cause little or no harm to other organisms. However, non-selective pesticides can harmor even killorganisms that are not considered pests. Non-selective pesticides should be used only when no other method of control is available.

Over time certain pests like rats and mosquitoes have developed a resistance to pesticides. Manufacturers are producing new chemicals and methods to control them. For example, cockroach eradicators know the exact point where

<!-- image -->

cockroaches breed and are able to apply sprays and pastes at those points to get rid of them. No longer does a hotel have to cover the entire area in a pest control programme.

The most effective and safe method of executing a pest control programme is by employing well-qualified professional exterminators on a contract basis. However pest control contractors cannot be expected to maintain the premises absolutely insect-free without the supplemental support and assistance of hotel personnel. For this reason, it is recommended that all maids should carry insecticide sprays on their carts and use them routinely when cleaning guest rooms and terraces. Recommended insecticides are harmless to human beings and animals, but it should be kept away from food stuff. These insecticides do not have a residual life and are, therefore, effective against a great many crawling insects, cockroaches in particular, on direct contact.

The residual insecticides necessary for a successful campaign against these insects are relatively toxic and must be handled with great care. It is recommended that they must be used only by professional  exterminators  unless  the  hotel  has  in  its  employment  an  individual  who  can  be trained in their use. They must also be stored in special areas away from human contact and food.

Cleanliness and constant vigilance, particularly in handling food, refuse and garbage is the best defense against rodents. All containers of these items should be clean and tightly covered and should be in metal. Wire enclosures should be used for dry food stuff in cartons and bags. This procedure plus periodic campaigns by the contract exterminators should keep the hotel free of rats and mice.

There is no area of hotel housekeeping and maintenance more important than the control of odours. Where as surface soil or disorder might offend the eye in a particular locality, odours permeate the air and can be offensive to guests at locations far removed from the source of the odour.  Odour  control  depends  on  cleanliness,  which  is  the  housekeeping  function,  and  on ventilation, which is a maintenance department function.

## Control Measures

Smoke from kitchens, bar odours and food odours can be controlled by adequate ventilation to secure optimum results. The maintenance department must constantly attend to the cleanliness and good operation of ducts and fans. Filters must be changed frequently. Air handling grills and louvers must be kept clean and unobstructed.

Housekeeping staff should be supplied with prescribed air-refreshers which counter musty and stale odours in a room. However, this is only complementary to actual housekeeping practices such as (a) allowing fresh air into a room by opening windows environment; (b) drying wet carpets by exposing them to sun; (c) following accepted cleaning methodology especially in bathrooms; (d) throwing away residual food (in coordination with the Room service for the clearance of trays, etc.) is essential as deteriorating food could lend a stink to the immediate environment; (e) taking particular care in the cleaning of nooks and crannies and under furniture for it is here that debris can lie for days.

Figure 10.1 gives an idea of who all depend on the Laundry department:

## 10.1 ORGANISATION OF THE LAUNDRY DEPARTMENT

## Importance of the Laundry Department

The laundry department is very crucial to the success of a housekeeping department. It is responsible to wash tons of linen and uniforms that are generated daily. The supply of fresh linen is crucial to be able to make rooms available for sale or for food and banquet outlets to be ready to sell their food and services. In other words, the revenue generating capacity is greatly enhanced or impaired by the efficiency of the laundry services. A hotel always has the dilemma as to whether to have an in-house laundry or to outsource this service, after all hotel keeping and laundry business are two distinct specializations. There are several criteria to resolve such a dilemma:

- 1. The volume of linen and uniforms are too few to justify an in-house laundry.
- 2. The availability of a reliable professional laundry in the city or town.
- 3. The reliability of the supply of fresh linen and uniforms when they are needed.
- 4. The cost-benefit of such a decision.
- 5. The ready availability of laundry specialists on a constant basis should a hotel choose to run an in-house laundry.
- 6. Space availability to install a commercial laundry in the premises. Laundry equipment takes a lot of space.
- 7. Alternative options for the space being assigned  can it be used as a revenue generating area.
- 8. The knowledge and competence of the Executive Housekeeper about laundry operations to be able to control such operations.
- 9. The easy availability of laundry equipment and its after sales service.
- 10. Cost to the payroll.

With such heavy dependency on the services of the laundry, any hotel above 200 rooms would prefer to have an in-house laundry.

## Organisation Structure with Job Descriptions

The Laundry Department reports to the Executive Housekeeper administratively. For technical purposes, it is headed by a laundry manager supported by specialist supervisors. The department has the following sections dealing with a specific area of specialisation:

## Sorting, Marking, Packing section

This is the area where guest garments are received by laundry, and sorted by several laundry treatments required: (1)  dry  cleaning  and  washing;  (2)  Degree  of  soil;  (3)  type  of  fabric;  and (4) urgency of delivery. They are labelled for identification later and packed for guest delivery.

## Washing and Dry Cleaning Section

This is the section that washes or dries linen, uniforms and guest garments.

## Tumbler Operation Section

This is a drying operation for towels and towel-like material that ensures that the material of a towel retains the fluffiness. Most modern washing machines will have drying features but towels will need special treatment.

## Ironing section

This is  the  area  where  linen  and  clothes  are  pressed  by  various  means.  Uniforms  and  guest garments are ironed by means of various types of presses:

Hot-head press where two flat surfaces press the garments. The top has a hot metal surface while the bottom is padded to absorb the heat and pressure.

Steam press adopts the same principle as the hot head press except that the top surface is perforated through which steam passes out.

Shirt press these are special presses to give mens shirts their proper contours and creases especially sleeves, shoulders and collars.

Hand press they are like domestic presses used for light garments. Laundries can have heavy duty presses for stubborn creases and materials.

Flat irons these are used for all kinds of linen such as sheets, pillow cases and towels. These are also calendar machines. These consist of cylindrical padded rollers through which steam is passed and the flat pieces are roll ironed.

## Spotting section

This area specialises in removing spots and stains.

## Valet Service

This is the area where the valet attends to phones from guest rooms to collect their laundry. Figure 10.2 gives the organisation structure required to run these services:

## 10.2 LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT

## Equipment for Laundry Operations

Laundry equipment is a major investment for owners. It is this that puts the owner in a dilemma of whether to have an on-premises laundry or outsource the operations. The decision he makes has already been discussed in the part. However, the main concerns in this regard are two:

- 1. The value of another large investment in linen and uniforms and their maintenace.
- 2. The reliability of supply of fresh linen to housekeeping to be able to make revenue areas like rooms and food and beverage operational.

These two considerations tilt the balance usually to having a captive laundry in the premises. Hotels with over 200 rooms may certainly decide to have their own laundry for the sheer size of operations. Smaller properties may decide to have part operations like only washing activity while outsourcing dry cleaning operations to a public laundry. Alternatively, the owner may decide to outsource guest laundry while retaining the house operations. Should the hotel decide to have their own laundry, the best allies are the laundry equipment manufacturers who are able to give reliable  estimates of workloads and the kind of equipment required to meet them. The main equipment for laundry operations are as follows:

## Washing Machines

Industrial washing machines are different from the conventional ones at home or those found at Laundromats. They have large capacities ranging from 25 to 1500 pounds and are bolted onto the floor on concrete pods. Heavier machines are more durable. Washing machines are sophisticated and come with many functionswashing, rinsing and drying. The washing machine has two perforated drums that rotate with a motor, mounted on a stationery casing. The inner drum carries the fabrics while the outer drum does the extraction function. The perforation helps in extracting the excess water from the clothes. Care must be taken that perforations are away to prevent damage to the fabrics. The perforations also feed water and detergent into the drum. The drum carries the fabrics and rotates at

<!-- image -->

speed to enable detergents to agitate the fabrics and dislodge the soil from them. The amount of detergent added must be just right to have the best results. Today, there are automated washing machines that feed and control the water and detergents electronically. Water too has to be fed at temperatures suitable for the wash. Electronic equipment determines the right temperatures. The washer man then has many options of water flow, temperatures and detergent feed for different types of cleaning cycles. Automatic washing machines also have rinsing facility that rinses out excess water. They also have driers that prepare fabrics with the right moisture content for pressing. Industrial washing machines must be kept busy as idle time costs as well as reduces the life of the machine.

## Tumbler Machines

Tumblers are dryers. They can be used as a supplement to washing machines that do not have drying facility or used for special fabrics like towel material. Tumblers fluff the fabric and give it the

## 382

soft texture we experience in hotel bed and bath linen. Dryers remove moister from fabrics by tumbling them in a rotating cylinder through which hot air passes. Industrial laundries install tumblers with greater drying capacity than washing because it takes upto twice the time to dry laundry than wash it. Dryers must be maintained well as clogging of perforations in the dryer due to lint can cut off hot air supply and sometimes overheat the equipment.

## Dry Cleaning Machine

Dry cleaning is a process that removes dirt and stains from fabrics. Dry cleaning uses little or no water, but the process is not really dry. It involves

<!-- image -->

the use of liquids called solvents.  Dry cleaning machines are able to handle volume fabrics of the

<!-- image -->

same type. The fabrics must be of the same colour and type. Before clothes are dry cleaned they must be spotted to remove any stains that could become permanent during the dry cleaning process. The dry cleaning machine has a movable drum that is filled with liquid solvent rather than water. A special dry cleaning detergent is added to the solvent to help remove soil. The drum rotates and the solvent circulates through the clothes. After the cleaning cycle the solvent is drained from the machine and the drum rotates rapidly to remove any  residual  solvent  solution.  The  clothes  are  tumble  dried  and rechecked for spots and stains before sending for pressing.

## Spotting Machine

The spotting machine is a self-contained table that has all the stain removers and steam gun for treating spots. The spotter uses a nozzle called a steam gun that can spray a jet of water vapour to wet the stain. Special stain removing chemicals are used depending on the nature of the stain and fabric.

## Flatwork Irons (Calendar Machines)

Flatwork irons are equipment with steam rollers that roll over large flat items of linen. Linen like bed sheets, towels, pillow slips and napkins are

fed into the roller by conveyor belt. Those that do this activity are called feeders. The items come out from the other end and folded into desired sizes  by  folders.  The  material  coming  must  be properly washed. The feeders inspect items before

rolling  them  into  the flatwork  iron.  Dirt  on

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

linen can shorten the irons life; too much sour can make them catch in the roller; and too much alkali can turn the linen brown. Linen should be moist before ironing as dry linen causes static electricity.  Alternatively, too wet linen can be difficult to feed in the roller and can overload the

effect of the flatwork iron. There are machines that are of single rollers and double rollers that may be selected according to the volume of work and efficiency required.

## Folding Machines

This term is quite misleading as the machine does not fold linen but secures it well for a folder to fold the linen more easily. Earlier, the folder had the onerous task of spreading the linen on a folding table and folding them with proper creases  and  sizes.  When  one  considers  the  tons  of  linen being  churned  out  by  washing  machines  the  task  seems challenging.  The  folding  machine  is  a  labour  saving  and productivity enhancing devise. However, nowadays there is good news for  folders.  There  are  folding  machines  that virtually  eliminate  tumble  drying  and  hand folding. These machines dry, fold, cross fold and stack the linen.

<!-- image -->

## Stackers

These are equipment that feed off from folding machines and stock the linen in appropriate sizes. It helps in determining the lot size for easy accounting of linen.

## Steam Cabinets and Tunnels

Steam cabinets or tunnels effectively eliminate wrinkles from uniforms and linen. It is a chamber fed with hung uniforms or linen that moves through the chamber either manually fed or on a conveyor belt, steaming them and removing the wrinkles as they move through.

## Steam Press

<!-- image -->

This device comes in a table top version that is operated by hand and a floor version that is operated with the foot. The press has two padded heads that press together. The top head opens

<!-- image -->

and closes and feeds steam on the clothes while the lower head is static on which clothes are spread for ironing. The hand-leg equipment has a foot pedal that when pressed can lower the top head and open it when pressing. A busy laundry will have several of these machines. This press is ideal for clothes that are too wrinkled and need smoothening out.

## Hot Head Press

This press is similar to the steam press in construction. The top movable head has a hot iron surface instead of a padded one and provides hot pressure on the lower padded head when clothes are spread for pressing. This is ideal for wrinkle free garments.

## Uniform Press

This is a press that mounts uniforms particularly tunics, jackets and coats to give its shape when pressing. It is efficient in giving consistency to the way uniforms look. It applies pressure uniformly to all corners of the uniform and is extremely time-saving.

<!-- image -->

## Shirt &amp; Jacket Press

It is similar to the uniform press but specifically meant for shirts and jackets. It gives the shirt collars and cuffs the right contours for perfect pressing. It is useful for expensive material that may get burnt in hand held operations.

<!-- image -->

## Steam Iron

This is the age old iron used at home. It is hand held and is good for delicate guest laundry and uniforms that can get damaged by larger press applications. The hand held iron is fed with steam through steam hoses.

<!-- image -->

## Transporters

In  addition  to  the  standard  heavy  equipment  given  above,  the  laundry  also  has  a  number  of mobile transporters to carry the volume of laundry from one machine to another or from the laundry to the linen and uniform rooms. They come in all shapes and sizes to meet the requirements in a daily operation.

## 10.3 LAUNDRY PROCESS FLOW

## Introduction

The relationship between housekeeping and Laundry is very significant for the smooth functioning of housekeeping services. The importance of laundry is inevitable as it processes soiled linen and uniforms and supplies housekeeping with clean stocks on a daily basis to keep hotel services running. It is, therefore, important for housekeeping personnel to know something of the operations of the laundry to fully understand its importance and contribution. The diagram below gives the reader an understanding of the laundry process flow:

Fig. 10.3

<!-- image -->

Guest Cycle

Let us take each step at a time in the process above:

Guest Calls: The process is initiated by the guest who has a desire to get his clothes washed, dried, cleaned or pressed. She takes the laundry list from the wardrobe and chooses the appropriate one (there are two lists one for washing and the other for dry cleaning and pressing). She fills the column Guest Count mentioning the number of each item and the expected cost of each set of items. She puts the soiled garments and laundry list in a laundry bag found in the wardrobe of the room. She calls for valet service by dialing the extension number found in the house service directory.

Laundry Desk Attendant: Receives the call and notes the name of the guest and room number. He alerts the valet.

Valet: The valet is the term given in hotels for those who collect and deliver laundry from guest rooms. He proceeds to the guest room and after announcing himself as per procedure. He then tallies the guest count with his own physical count and notes the numbers in the column House Count. He makes sure that the laundry list has the guests name, room number, date, urgency of service and his/her signature.

## 388

Sorter/Marker: The valet hands over the laundry bag to the sorter/marker who checks the clothes for spots and stains before it is sent for washing or dry- cleaning. He does not want those spots and stains to spread or become permanent in the laundering process. He first labels the garment with indelible ink to identify them in future processes.

Spotter: The spotter is a specialist who removes spots and stains. The spotter will return the garment to the sorter/marker who then sorts the garment by its texture and colour. He then sends it to the Washerman/ Dry Cleaner or Pressman for their necessary attention.

Washer man or Dry Cleaner: They will sort the garments and put them in similar batches. They will load the washing machine or dry cleaning machine for washing or dry cleaning and follow procedures. While the washer man uses water as the medium of cleaning, the dry cleaner will use a dry cleaning solvent. Washed garments contain water twice their weight. The water  is  squeezed  out  in hydro-extractors .  The  clothes  are  removed  when  the  cloth  has approximately 25% water left. This is recommended for effective ironing.

Pressman: After  washing  or  dry  cleaning  the  garments  go  for  pressing.  There  are  various presses that serve different purposes. Hot-head presses have two surfaces one iron hot and the other padded for semiwet garments. Steam presses adopt the same principle as the hot head press except that the top surface has perforations through which steam passes. This is used for clothes that are wrinkled and need steam to iron them out. Shirt presses are special presses to give mens shirts their proper contours and creases  especially sleeves, shoulders and collars. Hand presses are like domestic presses used for light garments. Laundries can have heavy duty hand presses for stubborn creases and materials.

Packers: Once the laundering process is completed the garments are sent in batches to the packer who tallies the garment labels with their respective laundry lists. He then proceeds to pack them as per procedure or hang them on hangers as requested by the guest.

Valet: The valet is handed over the packed garments with the original laundry list stapled onto the package. The valet proceeds to the desk attendant to raise an invoice.

Desk Attendant: He checks the package and contents with the laundry list and creates an invoice which is often a tear away slip at the end of the laundry list.

Guest: the valet proceeds to the guest room to deliver the laundry to the guest. At the room, he receives the guests signature to hand over to the front office cashier to post in the guests room account. Generally, cash is not encouraged as payment in the room but outsourced laundries may do so as they have separate billing processes.

## House Linen &amp; Uniform Cycle

Linen/Uniform Room: We know by now that the linen/uniform rooms provide specific times when soiled linen is deposited from the food and beverage outlets and fresh ones are issued on a one-to-one basis. Similarly, uniforms are exchanged during certain timings with all the staff again on a one-to-one basis. The soiled linen and uniforms are sent to the laundry following certain procedures (see Lesson 7 The Linen and Uniform Room).

<!-- image -->

Floor Linen: The floor linen is sent directly by chutes from floor pantries or deposited manually in linen hampers by the floor personnel. The linen is counted at the laundry floor by both the floor representative and laundry representative. To facilitate easy flow, each floor is given certain times to send their linen to the laundry. Going by this schedule, they can both plan their work accordingly.

Washing &amp; Dry cleaning: The piles of linen and uniform are sorted by the washer man and dry cleaner and placed in batches matching the fabric texture and colour. At this point, it is significant to have some additional knowledge of washing processes.

## The Procedure of Laundering

Laundry has for many generations been carried out mainly by the rule of thumb and it is only in recent times that research and investigation of different methods to laundering have been made. Research has shown that laundering is a very complex and difficult procedure.

In brief, laundering procedure can be divided into three parts:

- (a) What has to be laundered e.g. textile fibres, etc.
- (b) What is used in laundering e.g. water, soaps, detergents and alkalis etc.
- (c) How laundering is to be carried out e.g. washing processes, starch and associated treatments, etc.

Let us look at each:

## 390

## What has to be Laundered?

Textile fibres may be classified into three categories:

- 1. Vegetable fibres which have their origin in some form of plant life like cotton, linen, jute
- 2. Animal fibres which have their origin from animal life. These include wool and silk.
- 3. Synthetic or man-made fibres such as nylon, Dacron, Terylene, etc.

Except for vegetable fibres, animal and synthetic fibres safely respond to dry-cleaning procedures. In case they are top dirty; they too can stand a mild wet cleaning treatment.

## What is used in laundering?

## Water

It is the most important material used in laundering, not only because of the large amount required but also because the success or failure of the washing process depends upon the suitability of water supply.

One source of water is rain which, as it falls, comes in contact with compounds of the atmosphere and is able to absorb some of them. It, therefore, becomes slightly acidic in nature. The acid rain may dissolve some minerals from the earth. Water from springs and wells carry many compounds dissolved in it.

The most important impurities in water from the laundering point of view are the compounds of calcium and magnesium and in certain cases, iron.

When soap is added to hard water, the calcium and magnesium compounds react with soap to form insoluble lime soaps which are precipitated in the form of a sticky paste that traps dirt and re-deposits it on the fabric. Therefore, instead of becoming white, fabrics become dull and grayish.

The hardness of water (power to kill the soap) again can be divided into two parts:

Temporary hardness (bicarbonates  of  calcium  and  magnesium)  which  can  be  removed  by chemical treatment known as water softening

Permanent hardness (sulphates  of  calcium  and  magnesium)  can  be  removed  by  chemical treatment known as water softening.

## Soap and Detergents

Soap has been known to man from the earliest times, when it was customary to mix the ashes of wood fire under the cooking pot with rancid fats from the cooking pot itself. Today soap is made by the contribution of fatty acid and alkalis at different temperatures.

A good soap in laundering should have the following properties:

- (a) a good washing power (detergency)
- (b) Ease of rinsing
- (c) Easy solubility and purity.

## Synthetic Detergents

The main disadvantage of using soap in laundering is that it is killed by hard water. It is sensitive to acids and salts. Careful attention in rinsing is required so that no traces of soap are retained in the fabric. Detergents give more efficient performance in hard water, are easily soluble and are

easily rinsed from the fabric. They can be used with the builders or alkalis. In general, they are not as efficient soil removers as soap/alkali solutions. It is at the oil suspension stage that the synthetic detergents appear to be weaker and inferior to soap/alkali solution, because the re-deposition of soil  may take place. The use of CMC (carboxy methyl cellulose) in synthetic detergent/alkali solution brings about an improvement with the re-deposition of the suspended soiling matters being resisted and also with better whiteness results.

## Alkalis

They are used in laundering for a variety of reasons. The main reason is that the cleaning effect when they are used in conjunction with soap or other detergents is greater than with soap or detergents alone. They are also known as builders. At times, they are used to soften water before addition of soap. Acids and alkalis are measured according to a scale of values known as the pH scale. The pH scale has fourteen main divisions from 1-14. Pure water has a pH value of 7 and is a natural point.

An alkaline solution has a pH value more than 7; the farthest from 7, the stronger will be the alkaline solution. A solution which is acidic has a pH value below 7. The farther away in the value from 7, the more acidic will be the solution. The pH value denotes the nature of alkali and not the amount of alkali present in the solution.

A strong alkali can only be used on cotton where as a mild alkali on wool and silk.

The following is the list of alkalis used in the laundry: a) sodium metasilicate b) trisedium phosphate also known as soda ash and sodium carbonate and c) sodium silicate also known as water glass and borax. Sodium metasilicate is preferred in laundering where the hardness of water is not more than 4 degrees otherwise soda ash recommended.

A 0.2% solution of metasilicate has the right amount of active alkalinity to convert the acid soap to soap, rapidly and effectively. Active alkalinity is measured according to the pH scale. A 0.2% solution of metasilicate has pH value of 11.2.

Also sodium metasilicate does not set stains and thereby has the power to suspend dirt.

## Washing Process

In any washing process there are four stages. These stages are of equal importance and failure of any one of these will cause a fault in the final result. They are as follows:

- (a) wetting out
- (b) soil removal
- (c) Soil suspension
- (d) Removal of soil from machine.

## Wetting Out

In this stage, the load must be thoroughly and evenly penetrated by washing liquors. Without this thorough wetting no wash process can be efficient. Although this holds good for all processes, it is  especially  important  in  the  case  of  wool  washing.  Wool  is  naturally  waterproof  and  resists wetting and because of this special attention must be paid to the wetting out stage.

<!-- image -->

## Soil Removal

The separation of soil particles from the fabric is the main object of the washing or cleaning process. The best conditions for soil removal have been the subject of intense research and it has been found that these conditions differ according to the type of article washed. It must be obvious that the failure at this stage means failure of the whole process.

## Soil Suspension

Precaution against re-deposition of soil on the fabric can be taken care of by holding the soil in suspension in the washing liquors. It is not generally realised that this part of the process is the most difficult and that the slightest departure from the correct conditions means a lowering of the standard of washing. The difficulty arises from the fact that the soiling matter clings strongly to the fabrics  and  is  readily  re-deposited.  When  the  re-deposition  is  spread  evenly,  the  result  is generally grayness. Sometimes the re-deposition is uneven when it may take the form of black specks known as scum.

## Rinsing (Removal of Soil from Machine)

The rinsing stage is of no less importance than the other stages. It should be understood that in the first place, rinsing is a continuation of the soil suspension stage and that all the conditions for soil suspension must be maintained until all soiling matter has been removed. Only when the danger of a re-deposition of soil is no longer present, can the liquors be removed entirely. The main object of rinsing is the gradual dilution of the liquors and gradual reduction of temperature in the machine.

## Bleaching

Bleaching with sodium hypochlorite has no dirt removing power, It is impossible to bleach dirty work and make it white. Bleach may improve the colour of white work after all the soiling matter has been removed. But this is not a good practice. It is better to produce a good colour by correct washing methods. Control of bleaching procedure should be rigid, especially the amount of bleach and the temperature.

There are five conditions for the use of laundry bleach:

- 1. It is important to know the strength of the bleach purchased.
- 2. The maximum strength of bleach in a machine should never exceed 5 gms available chlorine per pund of detergent liquor or 3 gms available chlorine per pound of load.
- 3. The highest temperature should be 140 degrees F.
- 4. The required amount of bleach should be diluted with water before being added to the washing machine.
- 5. The diluted solution should be added as the machine rotates downwards so that the bleach is carried in the washing liquor immediately and not sprinkled over the work which would happen in the case of upward the machine.

## Bluing

It is very difficult to retain the whiteness of white linen and washed linen. Eventually, it becomes yellow white. This yellowness can be corrected by applying a film of blue in the linen which gives it the appearance of better white. It is not possible to make a dirty fabric look white by bluing, The effect of blue would be to make the colour farther from white since the blue is used to correct yellowness.

## Post Cleaning Procedures of Laundry

## Hydro extractor/Tumbler

After washing or dry cleaning the fabrics are sent for reducing the water content. Washed garments contain water twice their weight. The water is squeezed out in hydro-extractors. The clothes are removed when the cloth has approximately 25% water left. This is recommended for effective ironing.  Tumblers  are  used  for  items  like  towel  or  similar  material  where  the  drying  process aerates the fibres and brings about a fluff.

## Presses

After the drying process, flat linen like bed sheets, pillow cases, table clothes, napkins, etc. are sent to the flat iron (see the heading, Laundry Equipment of this Lesson). Other items especially uniforms are sent to presses as explained earlier in the guest cycle. The press men fold the uniforms and linen and assemble them in neat stacks in trolleys for delivery to the linen/uniform room/s.

## Linen/Uniform Room/s

A strict record of items received by the laundry and those that have been delivered is kept here. It must be remembered that the linen/uniform room/s are issue points and have to supply fresh linen and uniforms for the hotel to run.

## 10.4 DETERGENTS

## History of Detergents

There is no historical  date  that  can  be  ascribed  to  the  origin  of  detergents.  In  fact,  water  is considered to be the oldest detergent for cleaning. The first soaps came into being somewhere around 2800 B.C. A soap-type substance was found accumulated in cylinders in ancient Babylon during excavations. It was a mixture of fats boiled with ash. Historians, therefore, attribute the beginning of detergents to that era. The next known use of detergents came from papyruses of the Egyptian civilization dated around 1500 B.C. The document showed a recipe of vegetable and animal oils blended together for washing and even skin ailments. Greeks introduced clay and sand as abrasives that were used with blends of ashes and oils. While this is the only knowledge of detergents in pre-historic times, it is the Romans who introduced the term soap derived from the sacrifice of animals at Mount Sapo. The residual fats and ashes of these sacrifices was found to clean effectively. By the middle ages, cleaning mixtures became commonplace around the world. The Germans in 1916 are credited for developing the first synthetic detergent as a requirement due to soap shortage in World War I. The synthetic detergents reached America in the 1930s. Ever since then manufacturers have been researching and developing innovative detergent blends, to get the near perfect cleansing of even stubborn stains. The housekeeper today has a variety of these products to choose from.

## What are Detergents?

According to the dictionary, a detergent is a compound or a combination of compounds that is used for cleaning. Detergents are created considering that water is an essential requirement in the cleaning process. Detergents are found in the form of soaps, powders and liquids. While detergents are found in many forms there are certain ingredients that are commonly added to detergents to serve specific purposes. They are as follows:

- 1. Surfactants are added to remove grease.
- 2. Abrasives are used to rub dirt off the surface.
- 3. Ph substances are used to stabilize other harder substances used in the compound.
- 4. Caustics are used to break up dirt particles.
- 5. Softeners are added to deal with the harshness of other components being used.
- 6. Oxidizers are essentially used for bleaching.
- 7. Enzymes are a relatively new component that is being added to destroy any accumulation of proteins, fats or carbohydrates in the form of dirt especially in fabrics. Manufacturers are enhancing the cleaning experience with softeners, fragrances and foaming agents.

## Chemistry of Soap and Detergent

In order to understand what is needed to achieve effective cleaning, it is helpful to have a basic knowledge of soap and detergent chemistry.

## Water

Water, the liquid commonly used for cleaning has a property called surface tension. In the body of the water, each molecule is surrounded and attracted by other water molecules. However, at the

surface of the water level those molecules are in contact with the other water molecules on one side only which is the water side. A tension is created as the water molecules at the surface are pulled into the body of the water. This tension causes water to bead up on surfaces which slows wetting of the surface and inhibits the cleaning process. However useful water is in cleaning, it might not be useful in all circumstances and will need catalysts for it to be effective. It has a property called surface tension. You can see surface tension of water at work by placing a drop of water onto a counter top. The drop will hold its shape and will not spread. To reduce this phenomena we add surfactants.

## Surfactants

In  the  cleaning  process,  surface  tension  must  be  reduced  so  that  water  can  spread  and  wet surfaces. Chemicals that are able to do this are called surface active agents or surfactants. They are said to make water wetter. Surfactants perform other important functions in cleaning such as loosening, emulsifying (dispersing in water) and holding soil in suspension until it can be rinsed away. Surfactants can also provide alkalinity, which is useful in removing acidic soils. Surfactants are classified by their ionic (electrical charge) properties in water: anionic (negative charge), nonionic (no charge), cationic (positive charge) and amphoteric (either positive or negative charge).

Soap is an anionic surfactant. Other anionic as well as nonionic surfactants are the main ingredients in detergents nowadays. Lets look closely at surfactants.

## Soaps

Soaps are water-soluble sodium or potassium salts of fatty acids. Soaps are made by treating fats and oils, or their fatty acids, chemically with a strong alkali.

First lets examine the composition of fats, oils and alkalis; then well review the soap making process.

## Fats and Oils

The fats and oils used in soap making come from animal or plant sources. Each fat or oil is made up of a distinctive mixture of several different triglycerides. In a triglyceride molecule, three fatty acid molecules are attached to one molecule of glycerin. There are many types of triglycerides; each type consists of its own particular combination of fatty acids. Fatty acids are the components of fats and oils that are used in making soap,

## Alkalis

An alkali is a soluble salt of an alkali metal like sodium or potassium. Originally, the alkalis used in soap making were obtained from the ashes of plants, but now they are made commercially. Today the term alkali describes a substance that is chemically a base (the opposite of an acid) and reacts with and neutralizes an acid. The common alkalis used in soap making are sodium hydroxide also called caustic soda; and potassium hydroxide also called caustic potash.

## Soap Making

The method of making soaps is called saponification. It involves heating fats and oils and reacting them with a liquid alkali to produce soap and water plus glycerin.

<!-- image -->

The other major method is to neutralize fatty acids with an alkali. Fats and oils are split (hydrolyzed) with a high pressure steam to yield crude fatty acids a nd glycerin. The fatty acids are then purified by distillation and neutralized with an alkali to produce soap and water. When the alkali is sodium hydroxide, a sodium soap is formed. Sodium soaps are hard soaps. When the alkali is potassium hydroxide, potassium soap is formed. Potassium soaps are softer and are found in some liquid hand soaps and shaving creams.

## Soap and Water Hardness

Although soap is a good cleaning agent, its effectiveness is reduced when used in hard water. Hardness in water is caused by the presence of mineral salts  mostly those of calcium and magnesium, but sometimes also iron and manganese. The mineral salts react with soap to form an insoluble precipitate known as soap film or scum. Soap films do not rinse away easily. It tends to remain behind and produce visible deposits on clothing and stiffen the fabrics. It also clings to the insides of bath tubs, sinks and washing machines. Some soap is used up by reacting with hard water minerals to form the film. This reduces the amount of soap available for cleaning. Even when clothes are washed in soft water, some hardnesscausing minerals are introduced by the soil on clothes. Soap molecules are not very versatile and cannot be adapted to the variety of fibres, washing temperatures and water conditions present today.

## Enzyme Detergents

This is a modern development from traditional detergents. Enzyme detergents are defined as detergents that comprise enzymes as one of its main components. Enzymes are being added to detergents because they can break down fats and carbohydrates. Old methods of using detergents and soaking clothes in very hot water may remove stains but reduces the life of the cloth. However, enzyme detergents spares the clothes from vigorous processes and gives them longer life. Enzyme detergents commonly break down the protein content in clothes that are stained with blood, milk, sweat, etc. The widely ised enzymes for cleaning purposes are:

- l Proteases
- l Amylases
- l Lipases

Although the benefits of enzymes in detergents are widespread and essential yet its quantity in detergents is negligent being 0.4-0.8% on an average. However, only this amount is enough to do the job.

## 10.5 STAIN REMOVAL

## Stain-removing Equipment

<!-- image -->

Stains are one of the greatest challenges to a housekeeper and laundry manager. Stains are inevitable in any operations and the expertise of the housekeeping department is judged by their ability to remove stains of varying types. The process of removing stains is called spotting. Good spotting equipment ( see picture alongside ) can be obtained at a moderate outlay and it will amply repay its cost in speeding up spotting operations in addition to creating an excellent standard of work. The advent of the steam gun and steam spotting table has done much to simplify the spotters task. The steam gun supported by a portable steamer (see picture below)

has proven to be an excellent piece of equipment for the removal of the majority of food stains, especially those of a sugary nature. The steam gun also accomplishes the removal of quite a large number of stains without using chemicals.

The steam gun must be carefully chosen as its design greatly influences the class of work which it will handle. The nozzle should be of the fish tail type as this is not so prone to blowing holes into fabrics. The handle should, if possible, be of the air insulated type as a handle which becomes hot during spotting slows down the work. In using the steam gun, the spotter should remember to spray with a continuous circular motion, holding the nozzle at an angle of 45 degrees in relation to the fabric. Brushes play an important part in spotting stain. Brushes with white bristles are ideal for use on white fabric, as should any soiling matter be picked up it is easily detected and the brush can be cleaned before a garment becomes soiled.

<!-- image -->

Brushes for woollens should be long-about 1 1/2 inch. Silk spotting brushes are usually smaller about 1 1/4 inches. The bristles are longer so as to avoid chafing the fabrics. All brushes must have a face which is perfectly flat as uneven bristles give a rough surface and damage the fabric. Brushes should be wellrinsed and left for drying each evening.

For the purpose of absorbing excess water, there is nothing finer than good chamois which should be large and thick. It should be rinsed in clean water and spread to dry. This will lengthen the life of the leather and prevent it from going old. Always use the chamois with a tamping action.

It is necessary during spotting operations to use an absorbent pad under stains which are being spotted, to soak up chemicals and solvents and the dissolved matter which they carry out, and so prevent the spreading of the stain.

A drying cabinet is ideal to dry garments after spotting operations.

A magnifying glass is most useful in spotting stains which are difficult to recognize with the naked eye.

## Classification of Stains

All stains fall under three categories:

Absorbed Stains are caused by staining agents which are thin in consistency and penetrate the fabric easily. Such stains are soft and pliable, except where fair amounts of sugar and syrups are

present, when some stiffening will be noticed. Beverages of all types, i.e. beer, tea, coffee, cola and medicines such as cough mixtures are few of the causes of this type of stain.

Built up stains are caused by liquids which fail to penetrate the fabric and lie on the fabric surface. Stains of this nature are diverse such as paint, distemper, tar, sealing wax, lacquers, glues and resinous compounds.

Compound stains are  a  combination of the previous two types as they both penetrate the fabric and leave a built-up residue on the surface of the material. Such stains are found to be of medium stiffness and never quite hard or soft and pliable. Blood stains are a good example of this type of stain.

## How to Identify Stains

Sight will tell the type of stain and therefore, is the method of spotting to be employed.

Odour is a way to identify perfumes, disinfectants, medicines and chemicals.

Colour like light yellow indicates a medicinal stain while reddish orange shows a rust stain. Blue or black indicate ink stains while brown shows oil stains. Black is for tar, inks, paints and heavy red oil; and green for inks, paints or dye stuff.

Feel helps in establishing the origin of stains as stiffness denotes the presence of oxidised oils, varnish, sugars and starches. Sugar and starch turn white when their stains are scratched.

Location helps to pinpoint the cause of the trouble. Perfume stains will usually be located on lapis of garments and in some cases under arms. Sweat stains can be found in under arms and collars.

The chart below gives a good idea of how to treat different types of stains:

| Type of Stain   | Type of Fabric   | Method of Removal                                                                                                        |

## 10.6 VALET SERVICE

## Introduction

One of the primary roles of the laundry is to provide valet service to guests. A valet service indicates to the guest that the hotel has a laundry facility either inhouse or outsourced. It is now an international practice to provide valet service. Most international chains would certainly provide one. A valet is one who, oncall,  fetches  soiled  linen  from  guests  and  returns  them either washed or dry cleaned as per the demands of the guests. In hotels that contract out laundry services, the valet service is provided by housekeeping. Some hotels may assign

this task to bell boys at night. The house telephone directory in the room would list a number for valet service. That telephone connection may fall at the Laundry desk attendants table or the housekeeping control desk.

## Procedure for Collecting Guest Laundry

As soon as the guest dials the number, the laundry desk attendant takes down the name and room number of the guest. Automated systems will give the guests name as soon as the room number is announced. The desk attendant can then continue the conversation using the guests name. The desk attendant may keep a running log of requests for valet service. He notes the time so as to monitor how soon the valet has attended to the call. He alerts the valet who proceeds to the guest room.

At the room, the valet knocks on the door announcing, Valet Service. This he does twice if required. The guest may invite the valet to collect the laundry. The hotel provides laundry bags found in the wardrobe. In the wardrobe are also two laundry lists, one for washing (Fig. 10.4), and the other for dry cleaning and pressing (Fig. 10.5) below. The lists are colour coded for easy identification. The guest should count the items and fill the Guest Count column. The valet proceeds to tally the garments with the laundry list by physically counting them. This figure he puts in the column Hotel Count. In case there is a discrepancy with the column Guest Count he brings it to the notice of the guest. He also checks each garment for tears, stains and spots to avoid any complaint by the guest when clothes are received after laundering. He may even offer to darn small tears as part of the service.

While filling the laundry lists the valet also prices each item and writes the total sum payable. It is also important to record the type of service required, whether normal, urgent or express. Each hotel may term the urgency of service according to their local practice. Should the guest require a service other than normal service, the valet must inform the guest when he can expect the clothes and what additional charges that will be levied for such a service. It is the valets responsibility to keep the guest informed completely informed. Many foreign travels may not know the customs and practices of laundry services of that country. They will appreciate clarifications of the same.

This may not be possible for guests who leave the laundry in the room before they leave the room for their business. They may sometimes call the laundry desk and inform them about this. In such cases, the valet will request the floor room attendant to open the room to collect the laundry. In such cases, he will again tally the clothes with the guest count. In case of discrepancy, he must call the guest later and inform him or her of the discrepancy.

In other situations, the guest may not call the laundry desk to collect the laundry but leave the laundry in a laundry bag on the bed in the room. In such cases, the room attendant calls the laundry desk when she enters the room for cleaning. The valet will follow the procedure above.

## Procedure for Delivery Guest Laundry

When guest laundry is completed the valet will deliver the laundry to the room packaged or on hangers as requested. He will follow the procedure to enter a room. He normally carries the laundry of all guests who request normal service as the items are ready by the allotted time. He uses the mobile clothes hanger to transport the clothes to each floor. If the guest is not there, he will request the floor room attendant to open the room. He will leave the packaged laundry on the bed or the hung ones in the wordrobe.

There are times when the laundry closes after the evening shift. In this case, the task of delivery is given to the bell desk, the housekeeping night supervisor or even the room service.

There are times when the guest would have checked out without collecting his laundry. In such cases, the laundry will be treated as lost and found and handed  over  to  that  section  in  the  housekeeping  department  to  follow procedures for such purposes.

## 11.1 TEXTILES

## Introduction

It is important for a professional housekeeper to have same basic knowledge of textiles as she is responsible for the volumes of fabrics of different varieties, that she has to choose from, select and maintain. Her main purchases are of linen that is distributed in volumes across the hotelon guest floors, restaurants, function rooms, etc. Her next concern are the uniforms that have to serve different purposes. Some uniforms are extremely rugged like those of gardeners, kitchen stewarding and engineering while some are dainty like those meant for front house jobs as reception, restaurant hostesses, waitresses, etc. Without some knowledge of textiles, the housekeeper is highly handicapped and will have to rely on whatever manufacturers tell her.

## History of T extiles

The earliest evidence of textiles comes from southern Turkey around 6000 B.C. Excavations show around 5000 B.C. the Egyptians wove flax. Archeologists have found Egyptian mummies dated 2500 B.C. shrouded in linen as good as what we have today. By 3000 B.C. cotton was grown in the Indus Valley, now in Pakistan and Western India. The Chinese began to cultivate silkworms about 2700 B.C. They developed special looms to weave silk. The ancient Greeks mainly used woolen textiles. They also used some linen. In 300 B.C. Alexander brought cotton goods from Taxila in now Pakistan to Europe. The ancient Romans developed a thriving trade in textiles. They imported woolen garments from Britain, Gaul and Spain; linen from Egypt; cotton from India; and silk from China and Persia.

From 400 A.D. to the early 1500s, the textile industry prospered in Europe. Woolen production centered in England, northern Italy and Flanders. They even had weavers guilds to protect and promote the textile industry. The spinning wheel was developed by 1200 A.D. and Italy became the silk centre of Europe. They invented a machine to unwind silk from cocoons.

The Industrial Revolution in late 1700 A.D. was considered to be the Textile Revolution. A flood of inventions brought great advancement to the production of yarn and fabrics. Some of these inventions were:

## Other Housekeeping Knowledge

- l In 1733, John Kay invented the flying shuttle which enabled weavers to pass the filing through the warp yarns mechanically rather than by hand.
- l In 1764, James Hargraves invented the spinning jenny that could spin more than one yarn at a time.
- l In 1769, Richard Arkwright invented the water frame , a spinning machine that was powered with water.
- l In 1779, Samuel Crompton introduced the spinning mule that combined the features of the spinning jenny and water frame and replaced both.
- l In 1789, Edmund Cartwright patented the first power loom .
- l In 1790, Samuel Slater built the first water-powered spinning machines for cotton in the United States.
- l In 1793, Eli Whitney developed the cotton gin which removed cotton fibres from the seed mechanically instead of by hand.
- l In 1884, Hilaire Chardonnet, a French chemist developed the first synthetic fibre called rayon.
- l In 1910, rayon was introduced in America as artificial silk.
- l In 1935, Wallace H. Carothers, an American chemist, developed another synthetic fibre called nylon .

The modern eras of the 40s and 50s saw the development of polyester, acrylic and other synthetic fibres. By the 1960s textile companies began making double knit fabrics of textured polyester yarns. These fabric were lighter in weight and more comfortable than double knits of other materials. Knitted fabrics become more popular as a result. Today the textile industry is one of the most advanced. For example, knitting machines are controlled by computers and produce highly complex patterns at high speed.

## Making a Fabric

Textile has traditionally meant a woven fabric. The term comes from the Latin word texere , meaning to weave. Many fabrics are still made by weaving yarn on a loom. But today all fabrics come under the generic name of textiles. Most textiles are produced by twisting fibres into yarns and knitting or weaving the yarns into fabric. While traditionally the process was done by hand, today machines do the job at incredible speeds rolling out rolls and rolls of fabric.

There are four major methods by which cloth is produced:

- 1. Weaving: It is a method of fabric construction in which two sets of yarns are interlaced at right  angles.  The  manner  in  which  the  sets  of  yarns  are  interlaced  determines  the characteristic of the fabric and variety. The lengthwise set is called the warp and the crosswise set called the weft . The warp yearns are threaded into a loom through a series of frames called harnesses. The harness raises some wafts and lowers other wafts creating a space for a shuttle to fill the space with crosswise yarnsThe way the harnesses raise the wafts gives the weave.

There are three basic weaves:

- (a) Plain weave
- (b) Twill weave and
- (c) Satin weave.

All other weaves are either variations of the above or mixtures of the three basic weaves. Plain weave is the most common pattern where the crosswise yarn passes over one warp yarn and under the next, alternatively through the width of the yarn. Plain woven fabrics are gingham, percale and taffeta. They are used for sheets, dresses and upholstery.

Twill weaves are when four sets of yarns are picked up in the following order: 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4 and repeated I diagonal lines. Popular twill fabrics are denim and gabardine. As the twill is strong and tightly woven, it is best suited for coats, sportswear and hardy work clothes.

Satin weaves are eight sets of yarns picked up in the following order 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. It may span upto 12 warp yarns. Common stain weaves include damask and satin.  Since this weave produces soft, luxurious cloth, it is best for expensive draperies, table linen and formal clothes.

The more the sets of yarns, the more intricate is the design. Therefore, there are three types of looms where the following kinds of fabrics are woven.

- (i) Plain loom where two to four sets of yarns are woven. The fabrics are plain woven fabrics.
- (ii) Dobby loom where from 4 sets of 32 sets of yarns are woven. This gives the geometrical pattern and most of the furnishing fabrics are woven by this method.
- (iii) Jacquard loom is  where 32 sets to 600 sets of yarn are woven. The designs are versatile.

The chart below gives the range of fabrics made by the three types of looms:

- 2. Knitting: It is the construction of a fabric by forming the yarn into loops which hang one upon the other with needles. This fabric may be constructed from a single yarn than runs across the fabric to a single group of yarns that run lengthwise. The work may be done by machinery or by hand. The finished product consists of crosswise rows of loops called courses , and lengthwise rows of loops called wales . The looped structure makes knitted fabrics more elastic than woven cloth.
- 3. Braiding is the method in which yarns from a single source are crossed diagonally and lengthwise. This form of interlacing is used not only with every type of textile fibre but also with a wide range of materials such as straw, leather or any flexible material which can be made into a continuous length.
- 4. Melting of loose fibres is called felting. The fibres are laid in thick layers and a treatment with chemicals is given by which fibres are beaten up to form a fabric. Wool is the most common fibre used for making felt though other fibres are fur and animal hair. Felt is ideal for baize, moultons and padding.
- 5. Nets and Laces are called open-mesh fabrics. They have wide spaces between the yarns. They are produced in certain types of knitting machines. Netting is used for curtains while lace are excellent trimming for delicate clothes.
- 6. Needle-punched fabrics consist of fibres that have been tangled together by means of hooked needles. The fabric looks like felt and are ideal for blankets, carpets and insulation material.
- 7. Bonded fabrics are made by joining fibres with adhesives. These fabrics are best for throw-away materials used once, such as swabs.

## Types of Fabric

If we take a piece of fabric and try to open it up, we find that the fabric is made up of strands, while the yarn is made up of little particles which we call fibres. In order to understand fabrics we have to know what makes a fabric. Fibres are the raw materials for all fabrics. Some fibres occur in nature as fine strands. Fibres are collected together, sorted out and then twisted to form a yarn. Yarns are interlaced together to form a fabric. Most natural fibres used for textile production measure ½ to 8 inches. Such short fibres are called staple fibres . Modern technology has developed synthetic fibres that are produced in continuous lengths and are called filaments . There are two kinds of fibres: natural fibres and man-made fibres (from natural sources).

## Natural Fibres

Natural fibres include animal, vegetable and mineral fibres. Plants provide more textile fibres than do animals or minerals. In fact, one plant, cotton, accounts for 95% fibres of the natural fibres in the U.S. Cotton fibres produce soft, absorbent fabrics that are widely used for clothing, sheets and towels. Fibres of the flax plant are made into linen. The flax plant is grown for its fibres and seed. While fibres are used for linen, rope and thread, the seed is used to produce linseed oil.

## Animal Fibres

## Wool

Wool is derived from sheep and is of two qualities. The long fibres are made into worsted yarns and the small fibres are made into woolen yarns. All finer quality of fabrics are made of worsted yarns. Woolen yarns are used for making yarns for knitting, carpets, blankets and felts. The fibres are sheared off and sorted out, washed and dried, then applied with oil and the fibres are combed so that they lie parallel to each other. From here the yarns are spun. Wool

provides warm, comfortable fabrics for dresses, suits and cardigans. Some members of the camel and goat family also produce wool. The Pashmina wool of the Afghanistan goat is the most rare fibre producing the finest shawls, carpets and rugs.

## Silk

Silk is derived from insects like caterpillars. These worms form a cocoon or nest around themselves with the saliva from their mouths. They lie in the cocoon and change into butterflies, break their

cocoon, lay their eggs on leaves and die. Silk is divided into two kindscultivated silk  and  wild  or Tussar silk.  Cultivated  silk  is  where  the  butterflies  are  killed inside the cocoon and after de-gunning the cocoon the yarns are reached out. This is the only fibre in nature which comes in the yarn form with 200 metres to 400 metres in length. The wild silk comes from broken cocoons and its yarn is 2  to 21  long. All finer fabrics are produced from the cultivated silk and the ≤ ≤ thicker ones from wild silk.

## Vegetable Fibres

These include the following:

- 1. Seed fibres e.g. cotton
- 2. Stem fibres e.g. jute, sunn and raine
- 3. Fruit fibres e.g. coconut, pineapple, banana and cacti.

## Cotton

Cotton is derived from plants which are 3 to 5 feet tall. The flowers of cotton are in pods. These pods are cracked and opened. The cotton fibre is removed and further cleaned. The seeds are removed, then these fibres are combed to lie parallel to each other and from this the yarns are spun.  Cotton  fibres  produce  absorbent  fabrics  that  are  widely  used  for  clothing,  sheets,  and towels. As earlier mentioned all long fibres make finer and thinner yarns and hence, the quality of

the fabric depends on the quality of fibres used in yarns. The strength and beauty of linen produced from flax fibres have made it a popular fabric for fine tablecloth, napkins and handkerchiefs.

## Jute

These plants are very much like bamboo but of thinner quality. These are cut and collected, put into water to rot, then the green layer is removed and fibres are collected and spun in yarns. Fibres of the jute plant can be woven into burlap. They are used to make sack and backing for rugs and carpets, etc.

## Coconut Fibres

These are well known husk of the coconut. The coconut is steeped in water and these fibres are removed and spun into yarns. These are used for door mats and ropes etc.

## Mineral Fibres

## Asbestos

It is the only real mineral fibre used for textiles. It is derived from rocks and these fibres are mixed with other textile fibres and made into yarn. These are used for firemens garments and to form fire-retardant hoses as they are poor conductors of heat though they burn at extremely high temperatures.

## Glass, Aluminum, Gold and Silver

These are melted and strung out into fine strands from which are formed fabrics like fibre glass, ideal for flame resistant fabrics, and aluminum, gold and silver threads for decorative yarns for bedspreads, evening gowns and tablecloths.

## Synthetic or Man-made Fibres

Most manufactured fibres  are  made  from  wood  pulp,  cotton  linters (leftover cotton from the cotton seed) or petrochemicals derived from crude oil and natural gas. The fibres made from wood pulp and linters are rayon, acetate and triacetate. Rayon and acetate are widely used for clothing, draperies and upholstery. Rayon is an absorbent fabric and  therefore,  dyes  easily.  Fabrics  of  acetate  resist  shrinking  and stretching.  Triacetate  has  the  qualities  of  acetate  and  also  resists wrinkling, so it is especially useful for sportswear. The chief fibres from petrochemicals include nylon, polyester, acrylic and olefin. Nylon has many useful qualities: it  launders  well;  it  is  exceptionally  strong  and versatile for clothes, carpets and upholstery. Polyester resists wrinkling and  is ideal for clothes required for long use. Acrylic is heavy and ideal for blankets and carpets. Olefin cleans and dries easily and therefore, is a  perfect  material  for  carpets.  The  chart  below  gives  a  more comprehensive idea of synthetic fibres and their uses to a housekeeper:

## 11.2 HORTICULTURE

## Introduction

We have already learnt that one of the main roles of housekeeping is the aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. While interior design is one aspect, the other is horticulture and flower arrangements. Large hotels may have the luxury of having a dedicated horticultural team to handle landscaping which is the external beautification of a property, duly supported by a florist responsible for all the flower arrangements in the house. Smaller properties depend on the housekeeper to fill in this function.  She  may be assisted with a few gardeners to execute the function. It is, therefore, important for any housekeeping professional to have some basic knowledge of horticulture and floral art.

## Horticulture

Horticulture is a branch of agriculture that specialises in fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental shrubs and trees. While horticulture encompasses a wide range of activities, for the purpose of a hotel it involves the use of plants in landscaping and in such decorations as flower arrangements. The word horticulture  comes  from  the  latin  word  hortus,  which  means  garden.  Therefore, horticulture is the art and science of gardening. While flowers and plants are grown in gardens, they  are  nurtured  as  saplings  in  greenhouses  and  nurseries.  A  green  house  maintains  exotic plants at controlled climatic conditions while nurseries are where saplings are grown to maturity before they are re-planted in the garden. Horticulture is generally divided into four main specialities:

- 1. Pomology is the cultivation of shrubs, trees and vines for fruits.
- 2. Olericulture deals with those plants raised for use as vegetables.
- 3. Floriculture is the production and use of flowers and foliage plants.
- 4. Ornamental horticulture is  concerned  with  shrubs,  lawns  and  ornamental  trees  for landscaping.

In this chapter, we will be concerned with landscaping and Floral art.

## Landscaping

Landscaping is the science of designing and developing land for human enjoyment. In a hotel, it typically represents the external captive area of the hotel. The external areas represent the quality of the hotel and its management and provide the first evidence of the same to a visitor even before s/he steps inside a hotel. It promotes the hotel and creates an ambience of peace and tranquility. This visual impact is created by gardens and the adornments that enhance it.  The landscape is done by landscape architects at the inception of the hotel. They study the climatic

<!-- image -->

conditions, water supply, and type of vegetation, soil composition and the slope of the land. They preserve attractive views especially of city landmarks. They then proceed to dig the land and bring it into shape. They determine the shrubbery and flowers and handover the continued responsibility of the upkeep of the landsacpes to the hotels horticulturist or housekeeper.

The horticulture department of the hotel consists of a horticulturist, head gardener and gardeners. The number of gardeners will depend

## 416

on the total landscapes involved. One must keep in mind that landscapes could include private beaches; hill slopes; cascades; and water ways. The more complex the landscape will require different expertise and numbers to maintain them.

## Horticultural Facilities &amp; Equipment

A landscape will have a water supply system .  This is very important to gardens. Flowers and shrubs need water for survival. Water heads have to be further distributed to the far corners of the garden. This is achieved by sprinkler systems. The role of water gets acute when the landscape has waterways, waterfalls and islands where large volumes of water are required.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Another major feature is a nursery for saplings. It is a dedicated portion of land away from the guest view, where all the preliminary preparation of plants is done. This includes growing them from seed to sapling to the extent that they are ready for transplanting to flower beds. The nursery is also the place where flower pots are prepared for internal decoration. Those flowers that are suitable for indoor use are nurtured here before they are transported indoors. They would have to be recycled periodically for sunlight

and are brought to the nursery.

The next major feature is a greenhouse . This feature is optional. Superior hotels like to have an edge over others by displaying exotic flowers. They procure them from all parts of the world. Some hotels may have their flowers as their signature. The greenhouses maintain flowers in controlled climatic

conditions.

<!-- image -->

Another essential construction for a horticultural operation is the garden shed . The shed is where all the small gardening tools are stored. Large landscapes will have large numbers of tools for gardeners to complete their work. The shed could also be where the manure of the gardens is stored. Another alternative is the nursery.

<!-- image -->

The horticultural team has an assortment of gardening tools to help  them  accomplish  their  work.  These  include  essentials  like shovels for digging up large amount of soil; trowels for shallow digging especially to transplant saplings; wheel barrow to transport soil and other items; hoe for digging flower beds; leaf blowers for blowing aside unwanted dead leaves that scatter in the lawns; lawn mowers to cut grass into a lawn; pitch fork for picking dead leaves; rake for  collecting  leaves  and  soil; shears for  cutting  shrubbery; watering can needed to water indoor plants and select flower beds; hoses to  extend water to areas not reached by the main supply;

<!-- image -->

tillers to  prepare  the  flower  beds  for  planting; trimmers to  trim  branches;  flower  pots  for indoor and outdoor potted plants; pruners to crop flowers and branches; and finally, manure to fertilize the soil.

## Gardening

Gardening is  a  subset  of  the  art  and  science  of  horticulture.  It  is  the  implementation  of  the objective of horticulture to create a natural environment that lends natural beauty to the concrete structure  of  a  hotel.  There  are  two  types  of  gardens  that  a  housekeeper  is  involved  with:  a) Outdoor gardens and b) indoor gardens.

## Outdoor gardens

There are two types that fall in this category a) ornamental gardens and b) food gardens. The housekeeper with her horticulture team is concerned with ornamental gardens. In this category itself there are several categories:

- 1. Potted gardens: These are gardens where flowers like Begonias, Geraniums, Fuchsias and Petunias are grown in flower pots. Each type of flower requires its own care. Pots come in a wide range of materials,  sizes,  shapes  and  prices  bought  from  nurseries  and gardening shops.

<!-- image -->

- these flower beds have straight or rounded edges. The beds will have similar flowers that rise to a common height and shape. These need the constant care of gardeners to keep
- 2. Formal flower gardens: These consist of flower beds laid out in patterns to give a visually attractive look. Generally the edges of them neat and trim.
- 3. Informal flower gardens: These have different types of flowers of irregular heights in one bed. They need less caring and give a multi-cultured look.

<!-- image -->

- 4. Rock gardens: These  gardens  have  flowers  or  shrubbery  in  and around a rock arrangement called a rockery. The garden may have flowers  planted  to  rocks  already  existing  in  the  landscape  or  rock arrangement can especially be created in these gardens for this purpose.
- 5. Water gardens: These are gardens where water is the theme. Some properties may inherit ponds and lakes. Flower arrangements can be done around these natural assets. Other properties may create artificial ponds which are  expensive.  Another  aspect  of  water  gardens  are waterways, fountains and waterfalls. Some of these water features can have plants that grow in water like water lilies. Naturally such gardens

must have plenty of water and systems for re-cycling the water; filtration; and care should be taken that moss and lichens do not grow to ruin the freshness of the garden. Such gardens are expensive.

- 6. Wild flower gardens: These are gardens that take advantage of the local flora that is abundant. The gardeners can acquire them from the countryside and re-plant them in the garden. There are places that pride themselves with the flora of the place. The hotel can take advantage of providing the wild flora within its precincts.

## Preparing a Garden

The gardening process involves three steps:

- 1. Planning

- 2. Planting
- 3. Care
- 1. Planning involves (a) choosing the site, (b) selecting the plants, (c) making a garden plan; and (d) analyzing the soil.
- (a) To a housekeeper the site for  landscaping has already been given as part of the overall building plan. It is also possible that the site planning has been done by landscape architects.  However,  she  needs  to  have  some considerations in mind. The land must be accessible to water. There are sites that have natural underground water from where roots can get their sustenance. Underground water is provided by areas with plentiful rainfall. However, these areas must have a gentle slope so that rain water does not drown the plants. The slope provides a natural

<!-- image -->

drainage. For areas that do not have underground water, the property must ensure supply of water. Nowadays many hotels recycle their waste water for gardening purposes. This is a good idea and adds manure to the plants. Then, in site planning, the housekeeper must take into account those areas that have plentiful sunshine and those that have shade. She would naturally choose those locations for plants that need plentiful sunshine and those that thrive in shade.

<!-- image -->

- (b) The next stage of selecting plants is  crucial  as  seeds and saplings cost and the intention is that they grow and bloom. The  housekeeper  must  seek  expert  advice  from  seed manufacturers,  local  nurseries  and  gardening  shops.  Plants differ on how long they live. There annual plants that live for a year and need constant planting each year. Then there are biennial plants that live for two years; and finally perennial plants that live beyond two years. The housekeeper must select a combination of the three types to add vibrancy to the garden

Decorating flowers is a creative and stimulating art which often carries a message or theme and expresses the mood or emotions of the arranger.

- (c) It helps housekeepers to plan on paper the way the garden will look. It is better to plan the layout since the effort later will save labor and cost. This design should have been given to her by the landscape designer but in the absence of this, she will use her best aesthetic sense to plan the layout. She may like to check out the plan with experts to be sure.
- (d) Soil needs to be analysed for its fertility. This can be achieved by referring samples to local agricultural departments who will test it out. There are also soil testing kits available in garden shops. The soil must be neutral i.e. not acidic or alkaline. Some soils can be of clay or sand and will need organic matter like decayed plant and animal matter to improve the texture of the soil. Some gardeners use moss to improve texture. Green plants need chemicals to grow. While these may come from the soil, water and air, they will still need supplements of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that normally should come from the soil. If the soil has a rich supply naturally, it is considered fertile. There are mineral fertilizers that are not ideal to plant life but help. Others are organic fertilizers which we call compost or manure.

2 Planting: . The actual gardening starts by preparing the soil by breaking it up to depths of 8-12 inches and adding the organic matter. This process helps the soil to breathe, improve in texture and accept water. This when tools like shovels, hoes and tillers are used. The soil must be free from stones and made soft by gently tossing the soil over and raking it to distribute the soil into the bed. The next step is to add the manure or fertilizers to improve the soil.  Plants come as seeds, bulbs or saplings. Normally packaged materials give instructions on how to plant them. An expert will be needed to give advice on unpackaged seeds.  The trowel comes

<!-- image -->

into play to dig the soil to plant the bulbs and sapling.  Large amounts of seeds can be sowed by making a channel in the soil with a hoe; sprinkling the seeds along the channel; and covering the seeds lightly with the soil. Pour water to complete the task.

- 3. Care: Once the seeds are planted they will need periodic addition of fertilizer and plenty of water especially in hot climates. There are some plants that do not need much water. However, most of them do. The best time for watering is in the mornings and early afternoons. The water

<!-- image -->

needs to reach the roots, so thorough soaking of the soil is required each time. Part of caring is to take preventive measures to control disease and pests. Most packaged seeds give precautions towards seed care. Flower beds need to be kept clean because plant rubbish can be the breeding ground for plant bacteria and fungus. Pests too lay eggs in foliage and the housekeeper will need to look out for signs of pests like half eaten leaves.  Regular weeding is also a precaution against pests. There are a number of weed killer chemicals. But excessive use of them could damage the plants. A method to avoid weeds is by mulching. Mulch is a covering of

organic materials, chopped leaves, compost, grass clippings, moss, etc that makes a layer over the soil to choke the weeds from getting air to breed. Some flowers are tall and will need support

## Indoor Gardens

Indoor gardens are created with potted plants. The side pf the pot determines how large the plant will grow. There are special plants for indoor purposes that require little sunlight and water. Most of them are leafy shrubs rather than flowers. Ideally the plant can be next to windows or under

<!-- image -->

atriums. However, this is not essential. Some plants grow on artificial light from incandescent or fluorescent lamps. Popular indoor plants are the wax begonia; Boston fern; cacti; corn plant; common coleus; split leaved philodendron; English ivy; India rubber plant; and the African violet. To a housekeeper, indoor plants may be found in lobbies; suites; foyers;  atrium  lounges;  executive  offices;  business  lounge;  meeting rooms;  etc.  Indoor  plants  need  a  degree  of  humidity.  This  can  be achieved by placing pots on trays with water and pebbles, sand or charcoal.  The  moisture  evaporates  and  makes  the  immediate

surroundings humid. Misters are hand held equipment that squirts mist onto plants. This must be done at least once daily. Most indoor plants can be bought readymade or nurtured in the nursery

## LESSON  11 Other Housekeeping Knowledge

or greenhouse before placing them indoors. Basically, they need a fairly cool place away from direct sunlight and their soil should be a little more moist. Indoor plants need special fertilizers but care must be taken not to over feed them. They need to be kept aside from outdoor plants to ensure that they do not get disease or pests. They should be watered when the soil just below the surface is dry. They should be watered with tepid water and not cold or hot water. The best time to water them is in the morning. The plants will need to be washed every two weeks to flush out dirt and any small pests that may have lodged on them.  The plants can be washed in floor pantries

<!-- image -->

or in the greenhouse. Another way is to wipe the plants with a wet cloth or sponge on both sides. Regular pruning of dead leaves and flowers will improve the appearance and growth of plants.

<!-- image -->

Sometimes pots may need to be changed. Repotting can be achieved by inverting the old pot and let the plant with the soil slide into the hand. Place drainage material like pebbles or broken chips of clay pots, in the new container. The material needs to be only 1 inch thick for pots with a hole at the bottom. Put fresh soil in the pot and insert the old plant with  soil  into  the  pot  finishing  the  pot  with  fresh  soil.  Many  indoor plants can be easily propagated by taking cuttings from them. Most cuttings consist of stems or leaves. The cuttings are placed in water to develop roots. The rooted cuttings are then planted in soil and developed into complete new plants.

## 11.3 FLORAL ART

## Introduction

Floral art contributes significantly to the aesthetic upkeep of a hotel. We see wonderful flower arrangements on reception counters; buffet tables; meeting rooms; VIP rooms; lobbies and foyers; etc. These arrangements are prepared by s specialist called the florist who is trained in this fine art. The florist reports to the Executive Housekeeper who in turn is responsible for the overall aesthetic upkeep of the hotel. The florist works closely with the resident horticulturist and gardeners to  select  and  grow  flowers  appropriate  for  flower  arrangements.  Mature  flowers  are  cut  and pruned in her florist shop to those shapes and sizes desired by her. The florist is guided by certain principles in her art.

## TOOLS OF A FLORIST

The basic tools and principles that florists usually comply with are:

## Accent

Accent is a particular emphasis or strongly contrasting detail used to highlight a part of a design.  Accent adds another aspect to a design and will usually enhance the area of dominance

or help to make the area of dominance stronger as quoted from Flair magazine.

Ngaire Clarke, an expert on floral design explains the design on the right to illustrate the concept of accent, in her book Principles and Elements in Floral Design .

In my design on the left accent is the top swirl of reeds emphasized by the fine gold thread binding it. The rhythm is built up from the shape of the stand base with the reeds flowing through the design and swirling out the top.

Accent can be seen in the repetition of the colour of the stamens in the lilies being repeated in the leucodendron placements. There is a much smaller quantity (proportion) of leucodendron and stamens than lemon lilies, therefore, they are less dominant than the main central area of lilies, the stamen and leucodendron.

Accent creates minor pause points/interest areas within the design and yet leads the viewer on through the design looking for further interest in different areas/at different dimensions/levels.

<!-- image -->

## Balance

Balance is the actual and visual stability in a design. Symmetrical balance uses equal amounts of colour and form on either side of the central axis. Asymmetrical balance uses dissimilar amounts and placements to achieve visual balance as said by Flair magazine.

There are two types of balance: The actual/ physical balance so that the design doesnt fall over, and the visual balance , where the viewer sees the design as being pleasing to the eye, and visually the plant material is equal on both sides of imaginary line down the middle of a design.

This can be achieved, with symmetry by having similar forms on both sides of the imaginary line; or asymmetrically, where dissimilar forms are on either side.

<!-- image -->

Jill Ruddell of Whangarie, New Zealand explains, If you look at the design  on  the  right,  you  will  see  colour  balance  between  the  two placements, space balance as the two driftwood pieces enclose the space between the hanging and floor placements, weight balance as the bigger piece of driftwood at the bottom, is visually balanced by the height of the top arrangement counteracting its bulk. Jill had to achieve actual balance with the hanging arrangement so that it floated in the position she wanted.

The triangle  design  style  favoured  in  traditional  floral  arrangements and often seen in wedding and church flower arrangements can be used on window sills of function rooms or on banquet and meeting room tables. It uses strong symmetrical balance. The lines radiate from a central point in the middle of the design and each side is a mirror-image of the other. The focal point is always in the middle, with the larger flowers.

## Colour

Flair magazine explains this concept as A visual sensation dependent on light, with emotional and cultural association.

Johannes  Itten  devised  a  12  part  colour  wheel  which  offers  an understanding of the interaction of colours

The 12 part colour wheel is based on the three primary colours (Red, Yellow and Blue) placed evenly around a circle.

Between the three primaries are the secondary colours (Green, Orange and Violet) which are mixtures of the two primaries between which they sit.

<!-- image -->

The tertiary colours fall between each primary and secondary colour. Between yellow and orange, for example, is yellow orange, between blue and violet is blue violet and so on.

All these colours around the outside of the colour wheel are called saturated colours. They contain no black, no white and none of their complimentary or opposite colour.

Compound colours are colours containing a mixture of the three primaries. All the browns, khakis and earth colours are compound colours.

Colour in Floral Art is the most striking of all the elements, and its impact is enormous.

Complimentary colours are those opposite each other in the colour wheel, such as red/green, blue/orange and yellow/violet. Put these colours together and your eyes will almost sting as these colours are equal in colour value. Use these combinations to show off a special piece of plant material.

A colour triad is a colour taken from 3 sides of the wheel, If this is blue/yellow/red you will create a circus or childs room effectbright and cheerful.

Pick only colours from one part of the colour wheel such as the blues/purples/greens youll get dark effectswatery, mystical, relaxing. Choose red/orange/yellow and show heat, light, zing, wow factor and stimulation.

Choose two colours side by side from the wheel and one from opposite and youll get contrast and harmony working welltogether and the opposite colour balances the other two.

## Colour Harmonies

Colour harmonies fall into two groups, related and contrasting. The related harmonies are monochromatic and analogous, while the contrasting harmonies are complementary as quoted from Flair.

## Analogous

<!-- image -->

Analogous arrangements have related hues lying adjacent on the colour wheel, usually with a primary colour included, but this is not essential. Usually only 5 related hues are chosen.

In this scrumptious thanksgiving design the primary colour is yellow with the related red, red/orange, orange/yellow, yellow/green. Even the colour of the pie fits into the scheme.

## Monochromatic

The arrangements have tints, shades and tones of one colour.

In this design Nancy Murphy used green as the hue, with tints from the astelia, and apple green protea. The shades came from the hosta, succulents and fern. It is fresh and clean in its overall impression. It is teamed with silver balls and wire.

<!-- image -->

## Achromatic

<!-- image -->

These arrangements are d evoid of colour so only black, white and greys are used.

This wonderful design, the creator of which is unknown, has a black ladder shaped centre, painted black with white carnations in each rung of the ladder. Grey cane is  then  twirled  around  and  inserted  in  holes  to  give  this  lovely rhythmical feel, and it is all enclosed in an oval.

## Adjacent

These are two or three neighbouring hues on the colour wheel.

Maureen May of Auckland used roses and chrysanthemums from red/violet and violet on the colour wheel to achieve this beauty! Her innovative containers were two cones made with barbed wire and wool, all painted grey, with barbed wire floating around the design.

<!-- image -->

## Direct Complementary

This arrangement has hues that lie directly opposite each other on the colour wheel. Enid Sloane used this combination as red/green in a wonderful design she created for an exhibition. The red was anthurrium, and the green was orchids and aspidistra. Enids full design will feature in a future edition.

<!-- image -->

## Double or Paired Complementary

This is an arrangement where 2 hues that have one colour between them on the colour wheel, are combined with their opposites.

Deilene Hunt, runner up in New Zealands designer of the year, chose this colour scheme in her award winning design. She used yellow/ green and yellow orange from one side of the wheel and red/violet and blue from the other side. The iris and bronzed leaves and ribbon threaded through  the  grid  carried  one  set  of  colours,  while  the  iris  centres, anthurriums,  and  carnations  were  from  the  other  side  of  the  colour wheel.

<!-- image -->

## Near Complementary

This arrangement is when two colours adjacent on the colour wheel-almost! One of the colours is immediately beside the direct opposite

Therefore, if green and red are directly opposite, you would use red and yellow green, or red and blue green. Get it? It all becomes clear with a colour wheel! Therefore orange/red has an opposite of blue/green, go over one and you get to blue. You see this in the workshop design on the right, using persimmons, orange rope and blue hydrangesa.

## Polychromatic

The balanced use of many colours together

This example comes from Paris, in a large outdoor trough by the river Seine. This and two flower filled urns marked the steps down to a boat.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Split Complementary

It is when two colours opposite on the colour wheel replace one of those colours with those either side of it on the colour wheel. There are your 3 colours!

So take green for example; the opposite is red, go either side and use red violet and red orange! The example on the left is by Carla Barbaglia who used red/orange heliconias, and red/violet rolled leaves of the phornium

flax, with the green of the Ligularia leaves.

## Tetradic

This arrangement is when four colours lying equidistant on the colour wheel~ that is every third colour from any starting point on the wheel.

The florist Michelle, the author of Perceptions uses this combination in the design on the right, uses violet, yellow, red/orange and blue/green (almost).

## Triadic

The arrangement has three colours that lie equidistant on the colour wheel thats every 4th colour on the wheel.

This is the work of Paula Pryke and is featured in her book Festive Flowers. She uses the 3 equidistant colours of violet, orange (oranges are a little hidden) and green and then adds touches of red violet as well!

## Unity

<!-- image -->

A blending together of all parts when viewed as a whole as quoted from Flair magazine.

<!-- image -->

Unity is all about choosing your plant material and container carefully so every part of the design is used in harmony so all the parts look great when put  together.  Therefore,  the  container  colour,  size  and  shape should  be considered as part of the design, often this means bringing the colour of the container up into the design.

This unity gives a design feeling of all being connected, each part being in tune with each other part.

## Dominance

Flair magazine defines this as The emphasis of one part over another . The predominance can be in quantity, size, colour, density or position

Dominance is just that, a part of a design that dominates over the rest, in traditional work, or several areas that draw the eye in more modern design. Your eye will keep returning to this place of dominance. Traditionally this was the central part of the design, from which all other parts radiated.

The dominance must be controlled so your eye moves over the rest of the design after its initial attention to the first area it sees. It should also be in proportion and size to the rest of the design.

<!-- image -->

## Form

Flair says it is The structural quality of an object, or the design as a whole. Forms are 3 dimensional, e.g. sphere, cube, or pyramid. They may be solid or volumetric. Form is identified

<!-- image -->

in space. Shape is two dimensional and is the outlined appearance of a form, e.g., circle, square, rectangle, triangle etc.

Form is the 3 dimensional shape of a piece of plant material or a design as a whole. Forms can be round, and are called points. Forms that are long and thin are called spikes.

In this impressive design photographed at the Melbourne flower and Garden Show, the lilies are the points , the bird of paradise and raupo reeds are the line, called the spikes. The huge cones are also a

<!-- image -->

form. It is necessary to have a contrast of forms in a design but having too many varieties of form is often a clutter, especially in modern work.

A point can be regular or irregular, and rounds hold the eye longer than cubes. Large points attract you first and your eye rests there a while. An example of this is a flower face front on to the viewer. In the design on the left you can see how the lilies are placed not only full faced but also side view, down slanting, and up facing. This allows the eye to move on from the most dominant point.

A design with all spikes or all rounds is very boring, and it is the interplay through a design of the two that makes it interesting.

Lets have a closer look at the design above. On the left is a part of the arrangement that is all  points.  You  look  at  it  quickly,  think  about  the lovely lilies, and move away. Now the part of the arrangement that is all

spikes is on the left too. Once again it is monotonous and doesnt hold your interest for long. Therefore, you need both and suddenly you have the wow factor.

When you select your plant material for a design be aware that you need this contrast. If you like the look of a bunch of little daisies and want to use them in an arrangement, think about another form that you need to make a contrast to them. They are rounds, so you need perhaps spikes. When you place your rounds, put them so that their faces face in different directions, so the eye moves form one to the other.

Florists at the moment, in a very simple way, are doing just that, adding bear grass (spike) to gerberas and roses (points.) In this bouquet one can see how the bear grass has made the difference, and added interest

## Scale

The comparative size of the individual parts to each other, to the whole, and to the allotted staging space. from Flair

Scale is about the size of all the parts of an arrangement, including the container, the flowers, the foliage, the accessories, the base the design is on, and the area it takes up. Therefore, a tiny

accessory would look odd beside a large leaf or flower, and a huge vase with tiny flowers peeking out the top would perhaps be the start of a new, never seen before, trend!!

This wonderful piece by the Hibiscus Coast Floral Art Club was staged in a huge marquee at the Elleslie Flower Show in New Zealand.

It, therefore, had to be big to be in scale with the marquee. So the plant foliage had to be big, along with the accessory, the antirrhinums and the base it sits on. It also had to be tall to be in scale with the other parts of the design and even the towel drape had to be big and bold to fit to scale.

A closer look at the design shows it was a full size deck chair and beach towel, so you can see the size of that base and those antirrhinums was huge! The complementary colour scheme of red and green that they chose was also loved by everyone.

<!-- image -->

## 430

## Proportion

This concept is The relation of one portion to another or one area to the whole, and the quantity of plant material in relation to container and accessories. from Flair

So, proportion is all about how much of anything you use in comparison with the other parts of a design, be it other plant material, other forms, other colours , other spaces, the container or the accessories.

<!-- image -->

The three contrasts  I  use  of  light  and  dark,  rough  and  smooth, shiny and dull should also be considered in deciding proportion and it has  been  suggested  that  1/3  to  2/3  is  a  good  ratio.  Why?  Equal amounts may seem to be boring, and not interesting enough for the viewer to pause for long, while too much of any one thing may make it to dominate more than you wish.

The  arrangement  on  the  left  gives  an  idea  of  the  concept  of proportion. The setting was in the chapel in Stratford upon Avon, in England for Christmas 2001. The Floral Artists responsible for the wonderful, fresh, floral arrangements had the concept of proportion very clear in their minds! Notice in the background how they used trailing red ribbons to make the proportion of the tall stands to the plant material on the top, more agreeable.

## Rhythm

Flair  says  that  this  concept  is  The  visual  movement  achieved  in  design  by  repetition, graduation, variation or radiation. Motion and rest sustain interest in design.

Rhythm is achieved in a design if you have managed to move the viewers focus from one point to another. This can be done, as the definition states, by graduation. Graduation is achieved when you grade the flowers from the smallest at the edges of the arrangement to the larger flowers at the bottom or in the area of prominence. You can also grade the colours in a design with

<!-- image -->

strong colours at the focal area and lighter colours further out. In this way the viewers focus moves from

<!-- image -->

the stronger colours to the weaker ones.

Contrast is the basis of all good floral design and this is true too with  rhythm,  as  the  eye  needs  to  rest  for  a  while  on  a  design,

before  it  takes  off  again  following another  path  you  have  set  for  it.

Therefore,  you  also  need  to  create  calm  spots  and  this  can  be achieved with round forms or flat smooth leaves.

Line material such as reeds, rope, branches, twigs, grasses, and ribbon can also create rhythm. As Poppys design on the right above shows, repeating several line forms with variation has created strong

<!-- image -->

visual movement. Several curved lines have a strong rhythm. If all lines are the same, regular rhythm can be created by shortening or lengthening some of the material.

Poppy Fuller of Kerikeri New Zealand designed this whirl (see page 430) of visual movement and rhythm called The Twister for the Northland Designer of the Year 2001. Poppy used lichen, dried reeds, feathers, honesty seeds, red and green New Zealand Flax, stripped willow bark, copper wire and strips of gum bark wound around a metal frame to create the effect. It is a wonderfully free example of movement and rhythm created by repetition and variation. She used variable rhythm when the same type of line is used but they vary in shape and length

The design (see page 430) is by Diana Snowden of Kaitaia, New Zealand. The bottom placement shows perfectly how a round form among lines of movement allows your eye to rest for a moment, before it travels on. If you are a beginner, see if you can pick the other rhythmical devices Diana has used in the larger placement. Wreaths can be wonderful examples of rhythm.

## General Rules

When doing flower arrangements, there are some general rules to be followed as given under:

- 1. Material used for decoration is usually 1½ times as tall as the height and width of the container.
- 2. Use only three kinds of flowers and foliage.
- 3. Use not more than five kinds of material.
- 4. Design or lines can be circular, crescent, oval, oblong, and triangular or pyramidical.
- 5. Three dimensional effect or depth can be created by placing material in graded planes that is, at different distances from the central axis.

## Themes

Vertical lines depicting stately and bold character

Horizontal lines appear restful and calm.

Circular patterns denote satisfaction or completeness.

## 11.4 INTERIOR DESIGN

## Introduction

The housekeeper, as part of her essential function towards aesthetic upkeep of the property, is required to have some knowledge of interior design. At the inception of the hotel, the investors would have most likely employed a professional designer to plan the interior theme of the hotel. They could adopt themes of native focus or of international design. Such initial designs loose their appeal over time and the investor may plan to renovate the interiors or parts of it. For example, an owner may find that a Greek restaurant is not giving the right return on investment. S/he would then plan to replace it with a Thai restaurant. He would re-employ an interior designer who is expensive, or look to the housekeeper to lead the renovation programme. In either case, the housekeeper gets involved and therefore, must be equipped to accomplish such a task.

<!-- image -->

## Interior Design

Interior decoration is also called interior design by professionals, as they see that the function goes beyond just décor; its a complete concept. Therefore, interior decoration is the art of creating indoor areas that are attractive, comfortable and practical. The process involves creating a theme; deciding the draperies, carpets, furniture and artefacts; optimum utilization of space; lighting and climate control; indoor plants and foliage; and other elements that lend harmony and beauty to the total concept.

The first step is to develop a plan. A plan is a drawing or blueprint of the concept. It will include the following:

- 1. The purpose for which the space is being planned.
- 2. The budget available to the owner for the project.
- 3. The type of guests and clientele that the area will serve.
- 4. The service issues involved for those who will work there.
- 5. The availability of quality products at the least cost.
- 6. The reliability of suppliers who can provide the  materials for the theme.

## 434

- 7. Internal architecture of the space; its special features and drawbacks.
- 8. The amount of natural light.
- 9. The type of mood such as informal or formal mood that is desired.
- 10. Proportions of equipment and furniture that will be used.
- 11. Maintenance issues of all the materials used.

<!-- image -->

- 12. Replacements of materials over time and their availability.
- 13. Local practices, taboos and practices.

## Principles of Design

The interior designer will prepare a concept drawing for the approval of the housekeeper and owner. Very often the designer will have to return to the drawing board to amend the concept to facilitate practical objections by the users. There is no perfect or right and wrong in design. The design can go as far as the imagination of the designer. There are, however, certain principles on which the designer operates:

- 1. Style
- 2. Form
- 3. Colour and light
- 4. Scale and proportion
- 5. Pattern and structure

## 1. Style

Style is a fashion, manner or custom from a certain period. The style the designer opts for can come from different historical eras:

- l Ancient times: The  designer  may take themes from ancient Egypt where the legs of tables, chairs and beds were made of animal feet. Three legged stools were the common furniture of Egypt as also Greece. The Greeks had high backed and low backed chairs representing  thrones.  The  common  chair  called klismos had  curved  legs.  The  ancient Romans borrowed their ideas from Greece but upholstered their klismos . The slab table was a major contribution by the Romans with marble table tops that rested on ornamental marble blocks. Oriental themes of ancient times came from China, Japan and India. A typical contribution from China was low beds called kangs that centred within a circle of low tables and chairs. The earthquake prone Japan had developed lightweight cabinets, chests, and writing tables. Furniture was simple with inlays of flowers and animals from their folklore. All furniture from Japan was well-lacquered and glossy.  Indias contributions were divans with plenty of cushions for people to sit on crossed-legged.
- l Renaissance style  was  during  the  period  of  European  history  from  13001600  A.D. when there was a great revival of classical style of Greece and Rome. The lead was taken by Italy, France, England and Spain. The palaces of Italian nobility were the centre of style in Italy. They had few extremely ornate furniture but the rooms were gilded with paintings. The prime piece of furniture was the casone a large chest a casapanca a sideboard. The French renaissance was led by two kingsFrancis I and Henry II. They hired Italian artisan

who introduced such motifs like columns, carved human heads, carved bands and niches in walls. This period saw the use of arches for columns and tables. In England, Henry VIII was influenced by Italian style and introduced extendable draw-tables and court cabinets for displaying crockery. Spain introduced Moorish styles. The Moors were African Muslims who invaded Spain in 700 A.D. Significant was a portable cabinet called a vargueno that had a flap that opened downward to serve as a writing desk. The Dutch created beautiful floral designs with inlays of tropical woods and mother-of-pearl.

- l Louis XIV of France style had a significant impact on the designers. He became king of France in 1643 and focused on art, culture and style. His palace in Versailles became the cornerstone of furniture of that style. The luxurious style was notable for two thingsthe veneer style where thin layers of contrasting materials (e.g. brass and ebony) were cut into layers creating contrasting scrolled patterns; and solid silver furniture and artefacts.
- l Regency Style was created by the regent Duke of Orleans soon after the death of King Louis XIV in 1715. Regency furniture had a lighter, more graceful quality than Louis XIV style, emphasizing curves and delicate floral designs. The most characteristic was the cabriole leg borrowed from Chinese styles.
- l Rocco style was initiated by Louis XV where furniture were designed to fit into wall niches built  specifically  for  the  purpose  by  the  builder.  This  tyle  saved  space.  Oriental  lacquer became popular.
- l Neoclassical style was brought by Louis XVI of France in late 1750s. The artisans did away with curves and went for straight lines of the classical period. They introduced geometric shapes in place of ornate decoration.
- l English Style started in 1700s with the Paladin Style named after Andrea Palladio, an Italian architect of the 1500. The style was based on Roman architecture which included decorated  chests  and  cupboards;  columns;  ornamental  mouldings  called cornices and triangular top sections called pediments . Queen Anne style was named after Queen Anne who ruled from 1702 to 1714. The middle-class could not afford the paladin style and went for simpler furniture that featured the cabriole leg. Chippendale furniture was introduced in 1754 by an English cabinet maker and furniture designer Thomas Chippendale. He produced a  furniture  book  that  reached  several  homes.  He  propagated  the  Rocco  furniture  that became the main stay of furniture in England and America. English neoclassical style was introduced by Robert Adam, a Scottish architect and designer. He borrowed ideas from French neoclassic style and added his own original style to it. For decoration, he used delicate floral motifs, ram and ox heads and other items inspired from Roman buildings and tombs. He also became known for skillfully blending furniture into the architectural plan of a room. Other contributors to his style were wellknown George Hepplewhite and Thomas Sheraton.

## 2. Form

Form refers to both the shape and the structural materials of an interior, coupled with the furnishings used. In a good design, the form of the furnishings harmonizes with the form of the interior. For example, formal restaurants may have high-backed chairs  representing  thrones  to  give  the  feeling  of importance. The fabrics may be soft and velvety. Casual restaurants may have straight lined utility chairs with casual furnishings and motifs.

<!-- image -->

## 436

## 3. Colour and Light

Colour and light play an important part in creating mood. For example, dark walls in a discotheque attract lights and give the dim look that is required for a night club. Dark colours on walls make large rooms  smaller and cosier. Pale colours on walls make the rooms larger. Lights can range from table lamps for intimacy to bright neon lights for public dealings. Guest rooms are kept intimate with table and floor lamps. A guest has the option to make the room brighter by switching on the ceiling lights.

## 4. Scale

<!-- image -->

Scale refers to the relationships between the size of the interior, the size of its furnishings and the size of the people who use the interior. A design takes into account the size of all these elements

<!-- image -->

and balances them. A design is out of scale when any of the elements seem oversized or undersized, too heavy or too light, in contrast with the rest of the surroundings. Therefore, glass tables which may seem transparent and airy would seem out of place of the rest of the room has heavy furniture and furnishings. Similarly, a heavy oak side cabinet would seem out of place in a restaurant with light wicker furniture. The scale of an interior in relation to  the  furniture  and  furnishings  certainly  has  a psychological impact on the guest. A restaurant with high ceilings and light furniture would overawe a guest. S/he

will feel lost in such space. Similarly, heavy furniture and furnishing in a small room would give the guest a feeling of being cramped and overbearing.

## 5. Pattern and Texture

Pattern refers to the design in draperies, floor coverings and other items in an interior. Texture refers to the surface appearance or feel of the items. Both pattern and texture are interlinked as

they give illusion to the eyes even though one does not touch it. Glossy woodwork gives the illusion of opulence even if the material was of cheap wood. Mat finished surface give the impression of intimacy. Ornate designs and patterns give a classical impression while geometric designs  give  impressions  of  modernity,  vigour  and enthusiasm. A variety of textures and patterns give the guest  a  feeling  of  adventure  and  exploration. Monotonous patterns and textures can be  boring. Then again these same qualities in different interiors may be

<!-- image -->

appropriate. Small rooms like offices can do well with light pastel shades. A monochromatic colour shows orderliness and discipline. Textures also effect light distribution. Dark textures absorb light and bring intimacy while light textures reflect light and create openness. Parallel lined patterns give illusions of space while designed patterns make the atmosphere cosy.

## 11.5 SAFETY IN HOUSEKEEPING

## Occupational Hazard

Housekeeping in a hotel is a very physically demanding job. The personnel are on their feet for a full shift of 8 hours during which they perform various tasks that are demanding for the body. The main concerns arise out of physical workload; excessive bodily motions; and awkward positions that put a strain on the back, limbs, shoulders and neck. Ina typical day they would be:

- l Walking: Consider the miles that public area personnel will cover when cleaning the length and breadth of a hotel. The gardeners will be walking long distances to care for landscapes and gardens.
- l Standing: All housekeeping personnel are on their feet in a full shift.
- l Stooping: Room attendants will need to stoop to pick garbage from floors; to clean bathtubs and water closets; and to get linen from bottom shelves of maid carts; to tuck in corners of bed sheets in guest rooms; etc.
- l Squatting: Gardeners will need to squat for long hours to while preparing flower beds and planting seeds. Their work at the nursery involves long hours preparing flower pots for indoor decoration.
- l Kneeling: Room attendants would kneel while cleaning bathroom floors. Public area staff would do the same to clean stubborn stains from floors and staircases.
- l Stretching: Linen keepers will stretch to get linen and uniforms from higher shelves. Room attendants would stretch to clean the upper reaches of bathroom tiles and mirrors.
- l Reaching: All  housekeeping  personnel  will  have  to  reach  for  something  or  the  other. Room attendants will have to reach for cleaning supplies; linen and uniform keepers have to reach for items in exchange; the florist has to reach for things while doing the flower arrangements; etc.
- l Twisting: Room attendants and public cleaners have to twist their torso to clean areas around them to achieve maximum productivity.
- l Crouching: This is required to clean lower reaches of furniture like under dressers and lower shelves of wardrobe. Gardeners have to crouch to tend to floor indoor plants, etc.
- l Lifting: Room attendants have to lift weighty linen off beds and maid carts; housemen have to lift heavy furniture and carpets; public area housemen have to lift furniture to rearrange them; gardeners have to lift potted plants; and the list goes on.
- l Pushing: Housekeeping personnel have to push maid carts; vacuum cleaners; shampoo machines; trolleys; etc.

The above are only sample situations when the body is under pressure. There are countless number of other situations in a shift that truly challenge housekeeping personnel. Statistics show that that a housekeeper changes body position every three seconds while preparing a room. If we assume that the average cleaning time for a room is 40 minutes and she does 16 rooms in a shift she would end up doing 8000 different postures every shift. It can be classified as heavy to very heavy work because the energy required is approximately 4 kilo calories per minute.

## Reducing the Physical Stress

The question then arises, how we reduce this physical stress on housekeeping personnel. The following suggestions are useful to keep in mind:

- 1. Lighter equipment can reduce work. While purchasing equipment one of the criteria would be their lightness. Also all heavy equipment must be on wheels, even those racks installed in linen/uniform rooms which may not be moved daily. Portability helps greatly in work management.
- 2. Motorised equipment can  help  in  relieving  the  effort,  just  like  the  vacuum  cleaners. Portable  bathroom  scrubbers  or  window  cleaners  can  help  in  cleaning.  With  the  same intention, mops and brooms must have long handles to reduce stooping, crouching and kneeling that contribute to musculosketal injuries immediately and in later years.
- 3. Modern detergents help in cleaning spots and stains easily with a swipe that may eliminate tedious  scrubbing.  The  housekeeper  must  constantly  research  the  market  for  new developments and encourage trials when suppliers arrive at the door step.
- 4. Job Rotation is one possible approach to prevent permanent injuries. It requires workers to move to different tasks to allow muscles already stressed to rest. Room attendants could perform linen exchange duties or procure supplies from the stores. Supervisors can be rotated from floors to desk control operations or night supervisors to day shifts.
- 5. Job enlargement is a credible alternative where the scope of tasks is broadened to give balanced exposure. For example public area cleaners can be asked to do some administrative duties like general supplies; cleaning equipment; issue of equipment from stores; etc.
- 6. Teamwork is a wonderful idea when teams plan their work and help each other. Tasks can be shared like housemen doing the vacuuming of rooms or supervisors help in replenishing maid carts.
- 7. Education and training in  safe  work  practices  must  be  part  of  an  ongoing  agenda. Training must concentrate on removing bad habits and replacing them with improved work habits.

## Work Hazards and Prevention

Let us examine the areas in a housekeeping operation when accidents take place:

- 1. Falls from slippery floors; make-shift ladders; cluttered work areas; and improper carpet lay out.
- 2. Cuts from broken glass in linen bundles and garbage.
- 3. Back pains from improper working postures.
- 4. Muscle cramps from improper lifting.
- 5. Breathing problems and burns from the use of hazardous chemicals and detergents.
- 6. Electrocution from live electric wires and improper maintenance and use of equipment.
- 7. Injuries due to improper work habits.

Let us look at each of these and examine how to prevent them:

## Falls

It is customary nowadays to put the sign Wet Floor whenever wet cleaning is done. This protects both guests and employees. It protects hotel management from litigations due to injuries of this nature.

Ladders are key tools for cleaning high places or reaching higher shelves. Ladders come in many sizes from step stools to extended ladders. Ladders must be stable and strong. The rungs must be well fixed and any loose rungs must be attended to immediately before use. Ladders come in wood and aluminium. It is better to use aluminium ladders as they are light and look better than wood in public areas. The ladders must have rubber footing to prevent slippage. Ladders come with support rods so that they do not have to lean against walls to scratch them. Should the ladder be without support, it should be kept one fourth of its length away from the wall. The person climbing must be free of tools in the hand and should climb while facing the ladder. The employee should not climb to the top of the ladder to prevent the ladder from becoming top heavy and losing balance. It is preferred to climb leaving the last two rungs. Employees must position the ladder so as to reach the desired spots easily. Over-reaching can cause imbalance to the ladder. It is preferable to have someone holding the ladder from below even if it has support rods. The helper can pass tools as well as caution passers by from walking below the ladder. It may be prudent to put a sign Do not walk under the ladder. Employees must be prevented from using make-shift ladders like packing crates or chairs.

Cluttered workplaces have the hazard of falls. Employees must keep their areas free for easy traffic. Tools and articles must be kept against walls in corridors.

Curled carpet ends can cause trips and falls. Usually hotels use synthetic carpets that stick to the floor to avoid curling. However, due to heavy traffic ends may be loosened and they can pose hazards. The housekeepers must be vigilant to these carpet ends in their daily inspections and should immediately have them re-glued to the floor. Rugs can cause curling over time. It is prudent to turn them over for a while so the edges regain their natural fall on the floor.

## Cuts

Any heap whether linen or garbage is a potential hazard for broken glass or exposed syringes. The cleaners must not place their hands into garbage heaps. Room dust bins must be emptied enmass into the garbage hamper of the maid cart. Room attendants are trained to shake soiled linen for guest belongings in occupied rooms. This is a good precaution as it also ensures that broken glass or other sharp objects are not hidden in folds.

## Back Pains

Back pains are a common complaint among housekeeping personnel due to the sheer pressure on their backs while doing their daily chores. The secret is to keep the correct posture while doing work. A correct posture balances the neck, chest and lower back in the natural curve. Those who have to stand for hours must do so in an upright position. It is good for those like linen and uniform keepers who have to stand for long hours in a fixed position at the exchange counter to keep their blood circulating by walking around.

Back pains and cramps are also created by improper lifting. Housekeeping personnel have a lot of lifting to do throughout their working day. Here are few tips for correct lifting:

- l Tighten stomach muscles in preparation to lift.
- l Bend at the knees and not the waist. Keep the head and back straight. The strong leg muscles help in the lifting process. Leg muscles are stronger than back muscles.
- l Use both hands. Lift while hugging the load as close to the body. Do not be over ambitious in carrying heavy loads. Carry loads that are comfortable and one you can get your hands around. Avoid twisting the body. Seek another persons help for heavy loads,

- l Walk with firm footing ensuring that the path is clear before the task. One should be able to see ahead over the load.
- l Use the leg muscles again when lowering the load at the destination following the same steps as ligting.

Back pains and cramps are also caused by sudden movements like tugging or pushing heavy carts. Ensure that items are welloiled after all the mechanical parts are meant to ease the tedium.

## Hazardous Chemicals

Housekeepers normally use mild detergents for daily use. However, potent chemicals like acids and potent detergents are unavoidable for difficult stain treatment. Exposure to such chemicals can cause allergy, nausea, burns, vomiting, breathing problems, skin rashes, blindness and even death. Cleaners must be trained in the safe use of these chemicals. Suppliers often provide the training and safety pamphlets in the use of these chemicals. Employees must be provided with safety goggles, gloves and masks for operations that involve the use of hazardous chemicals. Housekeepers must make sure that these items are labelled properly and stored in separate areas in the store that is not easily accessible.

## Electrocution

There are several precautions to be taken to prevent electrical hazards. Firstly, the housekeeper must ensure that the equipment she buys has the ISI stamp of safety. This stamp is provided by local regulatory bodies confirming that equipment manufacturers have followed safety rules before selling their equipment to clients. Secondly, she must ensure that the housekeeping employees are properly trained in the use of equipment. The manufacturers are the best people to provide this training. The housekeeper must release the employees for such training as it is not only a safety precaution for the employee but also ensures a long life for the equipment. Thirdly, employees using the equipment must follow the following general precautions:

- l Never operate electrical equipments in water, as it is a deadly conductor of electricity.
- l Ensure that connections to sockets are made with proper insulated plugs and not with open wires. Connections must be made by holding the plug firmly. The same must be followed when unplugging them.
- l Switch off equipment as soon as the employee observes sparks, smoke or flames.
- l Cords must be uncoiled before using the equipment. They should not be kept loose in traffic areas to prevent falls. Cords must not be stretched beyond their length. Extension cords are handy to extend to their lengths.
- l The employee must check all appliances like guest room television, coffee machine and mini-bar for loose connections. Lamps must also be checked and faulty connections should be reported to maintenance. Most open plug points nowadays have in-built safety features but should there be sockets without safety features, they must have proper covers.

The housekeeper must also ensure a preventive maintenance schedule for the upkeep of equipment.

## Proper Work Habits

Many injuries  are  caused  by  poor  work  habits.  These  can  be  corrected  by  proper  training. Housekeeping personnel can follow the tips given below:

## 442

## TEXTBOOK OF HOTEL HOUSEKEEPING MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS

- l Smoke only in designated areas only; never in the elevator in any case.
- l Ensure that elevators are not over loaded and keep to the limits as indicated in the cabin.
- l Use the correct equipment and accessories for cleaning.
- l Do not operate equipment when not trained.
- l Use accessories like gloves, masks and goggles when dealing with toxic material.
- l Use ladders for climbing, not crates and boxes.
- l Look for broken glass when cleaning. Dispose them in broken glass containers only, not in the garbage bag or dustbins.
- l Do not put bare hands into trash cans for they might get cuts from glass or razor blades.
- l Use the handrails while climbing steps.
- l Untangle cords of equipment before use and keep them away from pathways.
- l Report any safety hazards if you cannot rectify it.
- l Rely on maintenance to complete fixing jobs. They are the experts.
- l Check equipment for their serviceability.

## Housekeepers Responsibilities towards Safety

The housekeeper has the largest workforce in the hotel. It is, therefore, imperative for her to ensure safe conditions and practices in the department. Here are some guidelines towards safety.

- 1. Prepare  a  safety  manual  that  is  read  and  understood  at  the  time  of  induction  of  new employees.
- 2. Paste safety rules on walls at strategic points in the work areas.
- 3. Reinforce safety rules in daily briefings.
- 4. Ensure that all equipment bought have the ISI stamp of safety and reliability.
- 5. Organise continuous safety training.  Involve  experts  like  the  equipment  manufacturers; occupational safety department of the government; fire safety officials; and the municipal health department.
- 6. Build safety into all job descriptions.
- 7. Have a preventive maintenance programme for all equipment.
- 8. Include safety inspection in the supervisors daily cleaning checklists.
- 9. Declare rooms and public areas unsafe for use till safety faults are rectified.
- 10. Make sure that safety equipment and accessories are always in stock.
- 11. Ensure that toxic chemicals are stored in closed cupboards and properly labelled.
- 12. Ensure that all waste disposal containers are leak proof and maintained in sanitary conditions. Waste disposal external to the building must be in designated municipal areas and with concern fro public health. Also oversee that cleaners put recycled items in their appropriate containers.
- 13. Make sure that locker rooms have proper washing and shower facilities, with adequate supply of soap and towels. Locker rooms must be kept clean and dry at all times. Water closets must be sanitised frequently.
- 14. Ensure that housekeeping employees consume food and beverage in the staff canteens and not the public area.

- 15. Keep a timetable that ensures rest breaks for employees during their shift vigil.
- 16. Keep appropriate signs at hand to caution guests and employees towards safety.  Signs include  caution  signs  like  Wet  Floor;  labels  for  detergents  and  toxic  material;  safety instructions on equipment.

## First Aid

It is important for all housekeeping personnel to know about first aid as they could be the first ones on the spot to give immediate attention to a guest or an employee. It is a part of the overall safety programme. Many hotels organise training classes run by the Red Cross or St. Johns Ambulance or similar health organizations, for their housekeeping staff who are awarded certificates in recognition of having completed a first aid programme. This shows the importance hotels give to skills of first aid as inherent to housekeeping personnels jobs. Large hotels may have their own basic clinic with a qualified nurse.

The first step is to have a first aid cupboard or box in a central location. The cupboard could be located at the desk control room due to its easy accessibility to all housekeeping personnel. The cupboard should contain the following items:

- 1. Clinical thermometer
- 2. Cotton wool
- 3. Bandage roll ½ , 1 , and 2 ≤ ≤ ≤
- 4. Adhesive dressings (band-aids) etc.
- 5. Sterilized gauze
- 6. Tweezers
- 7. Bed pan and urine bottle
- 8. Rubber sheeting
- 9. Safety pins
- 10. Tincture iodine
- 11. Tincture enzoine
- 12. Junction violate solution
- 13. Dettol
- 14. Burnol or Furacin
- 15. Crocin tablets
- 16. Aspirins
- 17. Mercurochrome
- 18. Fruit salts
- 19. Antiseptic creams

The cupboard should be cool and dry and clearly captioned for easy identification. Following are some immediate steps that can be taken towards first aid:

- 1. Burns and Scalds
- (a) Apply Burnol liberally
- (b) Place burnt area under cold running water or ice.
- (c) If burns are serious, apply sterile dressing and send to hospital immediately.

Recently, local occupational hazard authorities of each country are making assertive legislation to ensure safe working conditions at work places. They issue certain rules and processes that hotels have to comply with. Some of these essential requirements are:

- 1. Employers have to build in the safety guidelines issued by the authorities and sign a declaration of compliance. Authorities make announced and unannounced inspections to ensure this on a continuous basis.
- 2. Employers have to declare the person or persons who are responsible to implement and monitor the safety rules set by the authority.
- 3. Employers have to declare the job positions that are exposed to hazards. They have to write the safety procedures for these positions.
- 4. Employers must keep records of accidents and illnesses caused by occupational hazards that will be studied by the authoritys compliance officers.
- 5. Employers must permit inspections announced or unannounced to the authoritys inspectors.
- 6. Employers must inform the concerned employees about the hazards in their jobs.
- 7. Employers must declare the chemicals and detergents stored in their property as also their storage  conditions.  They  must  keep  physical  inventories  and  dates  of  issue.  Chemicals include detergents, alkali, emulsifiers for degreasing, flammable material like polishes and cleaners, fungicides, adhesive materials and pesticides.
- 8. Employers must label all such toxic materials and mark X.
- 9. Employers must procure safety manuals from manufacturers and make them available to employees.
- 10. Employers must conduct safety training programmes and keep records of all such training for inspection. They must list the names of all employees who go through these training programmes.
- 11. Employers must display safety signboards and safety instructions in the prominent places. Some of these displays are provided by the authority itself.
- 12. Manufacturers must supply the employer with details of ingredients in the chemicals supplied e.g.  hazardous  to  health,  inflammable,  explosive  qualities,  harmful  radiation,  etc.  They must also mention the potential hazards for users and safety precautions to be taken.

## Fire Prevention

In dealing with this subject it is necessary to understand that it falls into two separate categories (a) fire prevention and (b) fire-fighting.

## (a) Fire Prevention

Fire prevention are those steps taken to ensure that fire does not occur. One of the most important requirements for fire prevention is good housekeeping. It is the housekeeping that falls under the jurisdiction of the maintenance department rather than the housekeeping department. However, the housekeeping department is involved in a major way through orderliness and the elimination of hazards. Housekeeping personnel permeate to all parts of the hotel during the day and night and, therefore, are the eyes of the property in preventing, locating and reporting fire.

## 446

The chief engineer on the other hand is the chief fire officer to fight fire in the hotel. He lends support in fire prevention by organising and supervising fire drills for all the staff. He is responsible for the fire fighting equipment and training his maintenance team as fire patrols as well as firefighters.

Given below are some of the fire prevention methods:

## Stairs

In most hotels, the stairway used as the service stairway is also the fire escape stairway. Stairways are hazardous even under the most favourable conditions. It is important to keep steps clean and free of oily substances that might cause slipping. Steps and rails must be kept structurally safe. Passageways should always be kept well-lit and clean and free of obstruction and debris. Keeping stair shaft areas clean and bright with suitable light coloured paints leads a great deal to promoting general safety. Most stairways lead to fire escape doors that are different from the usual exit doors. These doors have a push lever to exit. These doors must be kept clear and only used for fire emergencies.

## Care of Fire Extinguishers

Fire extinguishers may be rarely or never used. However, when they are needed, it is an emergency and must always be in working order, All fire apparatus, including extinguishers, hoses, valves and sprinkler systems should be inspected semi-annually and carry tags indicating the date of inspection  and  the  initials  of  the  inspector.  This  work  is  delegated  to  trained  maintenance department employees or an outside contractor. Used extinguishers and hoses should never be replaced until they have been properly serviced.

In the case of a woven fire hose, the procedure involves stretching the hose flat and drying it thoroughly before replacing it. If this procedure is not followed weak spots will develop which rupture the moment water pressure is applied.

Tank type (soda acid, fog and foam) extinguishers must be recharged. This work should be done by experienced professional people.

In  addition  to  the  periodic  inspection  described  above,  it  is  necessary  that  the  soda  acid extinguishers be tested at least every two years to ensure the solidity of the outside container and to ascertain the condition of the discharge hose and nozzle. These tests will avoid the possibility of explosion which can occur where tank bodies are weakened by corrosion or blocked nozzles. Both housekeeping and maintenance department employees should constantly be on the alert to ensure that fire extinguisher stations are not used to store or serve as temporary resting places for room service trays or cleaning materials.

## Fire Regulations

In  following  the  suggested  procedure  outlined  above,  each  hotel  should  develop  a  set  of  fire regulations. These regulations should be printed, framed and posted adjacent to every extinguisher and in service landings and personnel locker rooms.

## Fire Detection Systems

All hotels, nowadays, have to comply with fire safety regulations. This requires certain equipment to be installed as also training of people to be conducted. Unless this is in place, the hotel is

unlikely to be given its license.  Many hotels face the threat of having their license revoked if fire safety is not provided on an on-going basis. The main hardware that is required to be installed are fire detection systems. There are different methods of fire detection:

## Fire Alarm Systems

The fire alarm system is a method where alarm bells ring when activated. Hotels provide these fire push buttons at strategic points throughout the hotel, enclosed in glass and painted in red. Normally, such points have hoses, fire axes, extinguishers and sand buckets. They are all handy for any person at the site of the fire.

Fire alarm systems should be tested monthly. These tests might well be conducted in concert with  employee  drills.  If  an  alarm  has  been  pulled,  it  should  be  reset  and  the  glass  replaced immediately after the fire drill. This is the responsibility of the chief engineer.

The Chief Engineer ensures that the fire alarm system has an uninterrupted supply of electric power. He is responsible for ensuring that the system is connected to the emergency generator or, in the absence of such a generator, an alternate supply of power, such as batteries, which are properly connected and in working order.

## Smoke Detection Systems

Most hotel rooms have smoke detectors. Smoke detectors trip the alarm system if the smoke exceeds  permissible  limits.  They  set  alarms  in  fire  detection  panels  located  in  the telecommunications room or the engineering control room. There are two types of smoke detectors: photoelectric and ionization. Photoelectric systems go off when a beam of light located inside the detector is obstructed. Ionization detectors sense smoke when there is a shift of electrical conductivity between two plates.

## Sprinkler Systems

Sprinklers are set off by heat not smoke. Therefore, even if the smoke detector indicates a fire the sprinkler will not be set off. The sprinkler system has sensitive glass bulbs that crack with a certain degree of heat letting loose open water valves that sprinkle water in the area. They are located in ceilings of guest rooms, public areas, linen room and those areas prone to fire. The sprinkler systems are fed from dedicated water reservoirs that must be full at all times. Small hotels may create their swimming pool on the rooftop to act as a fire reservoir also.

## Fire Doors

Fire doors are provided, especially in long corridors to seal off a section of the corridor affected by fire. Like other fire equipment, when the need arises their proper functioning is very important. Therefore, they should be under constant observation and care. Fusible links and door closers should be inspected semi-annually and fire doors must never be blocked.

## Fire Drills

The management and the maintenance department should cooperate in organising fire brigades around a cadre of maintenance department employees. This brigade should, at the time an alarm is raised, be so organised that it can arrive at the scene of the alarm properly equipped in less than two minutes.

Employees of other departments such as housemen, maids and waiters can be organised to assist in such tasks as removing furniture, directing guests, etc. Properly organised drills held on a monthly or bi-monthly basis can serve as a very effective weapon in preparing for a potential emergency.

## Fire Protection Checklist

The manager of each hotel should either personally supervise the use of a Fire Protection Checklist (Fig.  11.1)  or  delegate  the  responsibility  for  examining  the  checklist  after  the  engineering department has made the survey. Any item that has been shown as effective as a result of the review should be promptly entered in a log book for correction. The management should follow up and insist that appropriate action be taken on every open item in the log book until the deficiency is corrected. A notation should be made in the log book when the defect has been eliminated.

## (b) Fire Fighting

Housekeeping personnel most probably will be the first to locate a fire and will have to take the initial steps in the fire fighting chain. In the first instance, they need to know how to classify fires and the methods of extinguishing them Some fires call for a wetting and cooling method below the ignition point. Others require a blanketing effect which either excludes or dilutes oxygen to a point where it will not support combustion.

## Classification of Fires

For all practical purposes there are three general classes of fires.

## Class A

Fires occurring in ordinary dry combustible materials such as wood, textiles, paper, rubbish, etc. In these fires the quenching and cooling effect of all quantities of water or solutions containing a high percentage of water are of first importance.

## Class B

Fires caused by inflammable liquids such as oils, grease, petrol, chemicals, etc. In these fires a blanketing effect is essential.

## Class C

Fires  caused  by  electrical  equipment  and  short-circuits  that  require  non-conductive  agents  to extinguish them.

To deal with such emergencies, experts have developed fire extinguishers to deal with initial fires of a low to medium magnitude:

## Types of Extinguishers

There are three types of extinguishers for hotel industry purposes. They are classified by the type of fire they are good at extinguishing. One must understand that as fires grow other combustibles may ignite needing all three types of extinguishers. Most hotel fires have been caused by electrical short circuits.

Class A fires require soda acid extinguishers, which eject water under gaseous pressure when they are inverted. They involve fires of wood and paper materials. Their use is limited to smaller fires since they contain only two and a half gallons of water. Water from hoses is used when fires are beyond the capacity of small extinguishers.

Class B fires require carbon dioxide fog or foam extinguishers for liquid, grease and oil fires.

Class C fires require carbon dioxide fog as the preferred extinguishing agent since it is non conductive. These are used for electrical fires. Care must be exercised in using carbon dioxide extinguishers. The nozzle should never be touched with bare hands when the extinguisher is in operation.

## Distribution of Extinguishers

The following suggestions ensure the adequacy of protection over given areas:

Class One Extinguishers: These are placed in areas of light occupancy such as offices or light public areas. There should be one fire extinguisher for every 5000 square feet, so located, that an individual will not be required to travel more than 100 feet to reach the nearest extinguisher.

Class Two Extinguishers: They are located in low occupancy, where fires of a broader extent may be anticipated, such as kitchens, boiler rooms, etc. Locations of this nature should have an extinguisher for every 2500 square feet, so located that an individual will not be required to travel more than 50 feet from any point to reach the nearest extinguisher.

Class Three Extinguishers: They are positioned in hazardous work areas such as woodworking shops, upholstery shops, paint shops etc. This class should be protected with one extinguisher for every 2500 square feet, so located that an individual would not be required to travel more than 50 feet from any point to reach the nearest extinguisher, as well as special extinguishers  in confined areas for special hazards. It is to be understood that fire hose racks connected to its standpipes or emergency water supplies are included in the extinguishers mentioned above.

## Suggested Procedure

Following is suggested sequences to enable hotels develop their own fire fighting procedure. Circumstances may not always permit adherence to all points in this line of approach but it should prove advantageous.

- 1. Close windows and doors of the room in which the fire has started. If in a general area close doors to all surrounding rooms.
- 2. Ascertain the extent and seriousness of the fire.
- 3. Ring the fire alarm box or call switchboard operator for internal assistance. Remember that it is advantageous to avoid the hysteria which accompanies a general fire alarm by comforting the people that help is on the way.
- 4. Inform the telephone operator and give a quick accurate description of the location of the fire with extinguishers.
- 5. Employees of the maintenance department should proceed to the location of the fire with extinguishers from their department as rapidly as possible.  A fire cart is recommended.
- 6. Employees of the maintenance department should consider it  their  duty  to  remove  all combustible or volatile material away from the fire area.

- 7. The first consideration must always be for the safety and peace of mind of the guest. All personnel in contact with guests must maintain an attitude of calm and reassurance.
- 8. If the fire is in a guests room, the guest should be evacuated immediately into the corridor and the corridor doors and adjoining room doors should be closed.
- 9. It is recommended that the emergency stairs are used for evacuating guests.

## Emergency Plans

## Introduction

Nobody expects an emergency or disasterespecially one that affects them, their employees, and their business personally. Yet the simple truth is that emergencies and disasters can strike anyone, anytime, and anywhere. in these times when unanticipated events like bomb-blasts, tornadoes, tsunamis, etc strike anytime, employees could be forced to evacuate the premises when least expected.

This chapter is designed to help employers plan for that possibility. The best way to protect oneself, the workers, and the business is to expect the unexpected and develop a well-thought out emergency action plan that guides everyone when immediate action is necessary.

## What is a Workplace Emergency?

A workplace emergency is an unforeseen situation that threatens employees, guests, or the public; disrupts or shuts down operations; or causes physical or environmental damage. Emergencies may be natural or manmade and include the following:

- l Floods
- l Hurricanes
- l Tornadoes
- l Volcanic eruptions
- l Earthquakes
- l Fires
- l Bomb scares
- l Tsunamis
- l Toxic gas releases
- l Chemical spills
- l Radiological accidents
- l Explosions
- l Civil disturbances
- l Workplace violence resulting in bodily harm and trauma

## How do we protect ourselves, our employees, and our hotel?

The best way is to prepare to respond to an emergency before it happens. Few people can think clearly and logically in a crisis, so it is important to do so in advance, when we have time to be thorough.

## 452

Brainstorm the worst-case scenarios. Ask yourself what you would do if the worst event happened. What if a fire broke out in your boiler room? Or a hurricane hit your building head-on? Or a train carrying hazardous waste derailed while passing your loading dock? Once you have identified potential emergencies, consider how they would affect you and your workers and how you would respond.

## What is an emergency action plan?

An emergency action plan covers designated actions that employers and employees must take to ensure employee safety from fire and other emergencies. Compiling an emergency action plan is a good way to protect everyone and the hotel during an emergency.

Putting together a comprehensive emergency action plan that deals with all types of issues specific to your worksite is not difficult.

It is beneficial to include the management team and the employees in the process. The goals of protecting lives  and  property  in  the  event  of  an  emergency  must  be  explained.  Participating members will be required to establish and implement emergency action plans. Their commitment and support are critical to the plans success.

## What should your emergency action plan include?

When developing an emergency action plan, its a good idea to look at a wide variety of potential emergencies that could occur at the workplace. It should be tailored to the worksite and include information about all the potential sources of emergencies. Developing an emergency action plan means doing a hazard assessment to determine what, if any, physical or chemical hazards at the workplaces could cause an emergency. Multi-worksites will need a separate emergency action plan.

## At a minimum, an emergency action plan must include the following:

- l A preferred method for reporting fires and other emergencies;
- l An evacuation policy and procedure;
- l Emergency escape procedures and route assignments, such as floor plans, workplace maps, and safe or refuge areas;
- l Names, titles, departments, and telephone numbers of individuals both within and outside your  company  to  contact  for  additional  information  or  explanation  of  duties  and responsibilities under the emergency plan;
- l Procedures for employees who remain to perform or shut down critical plant operations, operate fire extinguishers, or perform other essential services that cannot be shut down for every emergency alarm before evacuating; and
- l Rescue and medical duties designated to some workers to be performed.

Consider designating an assembly location and procedures for all employees after an evacuation. In addition, it may be helpful to include the following:

- l The site of an alternative communication centre to be used in the event of a fire or explosion; and
- l A secure onsite or offsite location to store originals or duplicate copies of accounting records, legal documents, your employees emergency contact lists, and other essential records.

## How are guests and employees alerted to an emergency?

The plan must include a way to alert guests and employees, including disabled guests and workers, to evacuate or take other action, and how to report emergencies, as required. Among the steps to be taken are the following:

- l Make sure alarms are distinctive and recognized by all the guests and the employees as a signal to evacuate the work area or perform actions identified in the plan;
- l Make available  an  emergency  communication system such as a public address system, portable radio unit, or other means to notify employees of the emergency and to contact local law enforcement, the fire department, and others; and
- l Make sure that alarms must be heard, seen, or otherwise perceived by everyone in the hotel. Such systems must have an auxiliary power supply in the event of electricity shutoff.
- l Make sure that tactile devices are used to alert employees who would not be able to recognize an audible or visual alarm; and
- l Provide an updated list of key personnel such as the telephone operator, maintenance engineer, security officer or lobby manager in order of priority, to notify in the event of an emergency during off-duty hours.

## How is an evacuation policy and procedure developed?

A disorganised evacuation can result in confusion, injury, and property damage. That is why when developing an emergency action plan it is important to determine the following:

- l Conditions under which an evacuation would be necessary;
- l A clear chain of command and designation of the person in the hotel authorised to order an evacuation or shutdown. The plan may designate an evacuation warden to assist others in an evacuation and to account for personnel;
- l Specific evacuation procedures, including routes and exits. Post these procedures where they are easily accessible to all employees; Guests can have them on the back of the guest room door;
- l Procedures for assisting people with disabilities or those who do not speak English;
- l Designation of employees who will continue or shut down critical operations during an evacuation. These people must be capable of recognising when to abandon the operation and evacuate themselves; and
- l A system for  accounting  for  personnel  following  an  evacuation.  Consider  employees transportation needs for community-wide evacuations.

## Under what conditions an evacuation should be called?

In the event of an emergency, local emergency officials may order an evacuation. In some cases, they may instruct the shutting off of the water, gas, and electricity. For national disasters, it is prudent to listen to radio or television, news to keep oneself informed and follow official orders.

In other cases, a designated person within the hotel should be responsible for making the decision to evacuate or shut down operations. Protecting the health and safety of everyone in the facility should be the first priority. In the event of a fire, an immediate evacuation to a predetermined

area away from the facility is the best way to protect employees. On the other hand, evacuating employees may not be the best response to an emergency such as a toxic gas release at a facility across town from the hotel.

The type of building may be a factor in the decision. Most buildings are vulnerable to the effects of disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, or explosions. The extent of the damage depends on the type of emergency and the buildings construction. Modern hotels, for example, are framed in steel and are structurally more sound than neighborhood business premises may be. In a disaster such as a major earthquake or explosion, however, nearly every type of structure will be affected. Some buildings will collapse and others will be left with weakened floors and walls.

## What is the role of coordinators and evacuation wardens during an emergency?

When drafting the emergency action plan, select a responsible individual to lead and coordinate the emergency plan and evacuation. It is critical that employees know who the coordinator is and understand that the person has the authority to make decisions during emergencies.

## The coordinator should be responsible for the following:

- l Assessing the situation to determine whether the emergency requires activation of your emergency procedures;
- l Supervising all efforts in the area, including evacuating personnel;
- l Coordinating outside emergency services, such as medical aid and local fire departments, and ensuring that they are available and notified when necessary; and
- l Directing the shutdown of plant operations when required.

The hotel may find it beneficial to coordinate the action plan with other employers when several employers share the building.

In  addition  to  a  coordinator,  designate  evacuation  wardens  to  help  move  employees  from danger to safe areas during an emergency. Generally, one warden for every 20 employees (guests) should be adequate, and the appropriate number of wardens should be available at all times during working hours.

Employees designated to assist in emergency evacuation procedures should be trained in the complete  workplace  layout  and  various  alternative  escape  routes.  All  employees  and  those designated to assist in emergencies should be made aware of employees with special needs who may require extra assistance, how to use the buddy system, and hazardous areas to avoid during an emergency evacuation.

## How to establish evacuation routes and exits?

When preparing the emergency action plan, designate primary and secondary evacuation routes and exits. To the extent possible under the conditions, ensure that evacuation routes and emergency exits meet the following conditions:

- l Clearly marked and welllit;
- l Wide enough to accommodate the number of evacuating personnel;
- l Unobstructed and clear of debris at all times; and
- l Unlikely to expose evacuating personnel to additional hazards.

Post layouts that show evacuation routes and exits at strategic points for all employees and guests to see.

## How to account for employees after an evacuation?

Accounting for all employees following an evacuation is critical. Confusion in the assembly areas can lead to delays in rescuing anyone trapped in the building, or unnecessary and dangerous search-and-rescue operations. To ensure the fastest, most accurate accountability of employees, consider including these steps in your emergency action plan:

- l Designate assembly areas where employees should gather after evacuating;
- l Take a head count after the evacuation. Identify the names and last known locations of anyone not accounted for and pass them to the official in charge;
- l Establish a method for accounting for non-employees such as suppliers and customers; and
- l Establish procedures for further evacuation in case the incident expands. This may consist of sending employees home by normal means or providing them with transportation to an offsite location.

## How to plan for rescue operations?

It takes more than just willing hands to save lives. Untrained individuals may endanger themselves and those they are trying to rescue. For this reason, it is generally wise to leave rescue work to those who are trained, equipped, and certified to conduct rescues.

## What medical assistance should be provided during an emergency?

If the hotel does not have a formal medical programme, investigate ways to provide medical and first-aid services. If medical facilities are available near the hotel make arrangements for them to handle  emergency  cases.  Provide  employees  with  written  emergency  medical  procedures  to minimize confusion during an emergency.

If an infirmary, clinic, or hospital is not close to the hotel, ensure that onsite person(s) have adequate training in first aid. The Red Cross, some insurance providers, local safety authorities, fire departments, or other resources may be able to provide this training. Treatment of a serious injury should begin within 3 to 4 minutes of the accident.

Consult  with  a  physician  to  order  appropriate  first-aid  supplies  for  emergencies.  Medical personnel must be accessible to provide advice and consultation in resolving health problems that occur in the workplace. Establish a relationship with a local ambulance service so transportation is readily available for emergencies.

## What role should employees play in your emergency action plan?

The best  emergency  action  plans  include  employees  in  the  planning  process,  specify  what employees should do during an emergency, and ensure that employees receive proper training for emergencies. During planning encourage them to offer suggestions about potential hazards, worst-case scenarios, and proper emergency responses. After the plan is developed, review it with the employees to make sure everyone knows what to do before, during and after an emergency.

Keep a copy of the emergency action plan in a convenient location where employees can get to it, or provide all employees a copy.

<!-- image -->

## What employee information should the plan include?

In the event of an emergency, it could be important to have ready access to important personal information about the employees. This includes their home telephone numbers, the names and telephone numbers of their next of kin, and medical information.

## What type of training do employees need?

Educate employees about the types of emergencies that may occur and train them in the proper course of action. The size of the hotel and workforce, processes used, materials handled, and the availability of onsite or outside resources will determine the training requirements. Be sure all employees understand the function and elements of the emergency action plan, including types of potential emergencies, reporting procedures, alarm systems, evacuation plans, and shutdown procedures. Discuss any special hazards onsite such as flammable materials, toxic chemicals, radioactive sources, or water-reactive substances. Clearly communicate to employees who will be in charge during an emergency to minimize confusion.

## General training for employees should address the following:

- l Individual roles and responsibilities;
- l Threats, hazards, and protective actions;
- l Notification, warning, and communications procedures;
- l Means for locating family members in an emergency;
- l Emergency response procedures;
- l Evacuation, shelter, and accountability procedures;
- l Location and use of common emergency equipment; and
- l Emergency shutdown procedures.

Train employees in first-aid procedures, including protection against blood borne pathogens; respiratory protection, including use of an escape-only respirator; and methods for preventing unauthorised access to the site.

Once emergency action plan is reviewed with employees and everyone has the proper training, it is a good idea to hold practice drills as often as necessary to keep employees prepared. Include outside resources such as fire and police departments when possible. After each drill, gather management and employees to evaluate the effectiveness of the drill. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of your plan and work to improve it.

## How often do employees need training?

Review plans with all employees and consider requiring annual training in the plan. Also offer training when doing the following:

- l Developing the initial plan;
- l Hiring new employees;
- l Introducing new equipment, materials, or processes into the workplace that affect evacuation routes;
- l Changing the layout or design of the facility; and
- l Revising or updating the emergency procedures.

## What does the plan need to include about hazardous substances?

No matter what kind of business is run, we could potentially face emergencies involving hazardous materials, such as flammable, explosive, toxic, noxious, corrosive, biological, oxidised, or radioactive substances.

The source of the hazardous substances could be external, such as a local chemical plant that catches on fire or an oil truck that overturns on a nearby freeway. The source may be within the hotel. Regardless of the source, these events could have a direct impact on employees, guests and the hotel and should be addressed by the emergency action plan.

Hazardous substances have already been discussed earlier in the chapter. If the hotel has a store of hazardous substances, there is an increased risk of an emergency involving hazardous material and should be addressed in the emergency action plan. Occupational Safety authorities require employers who use hazardous chemicals to inventory them, keep the manufacturer-supplied Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for them in a place accessible to workers, label containers of these chemicals with their hazards, and train employees in ways to protect themselves against those hazards. A good way to start is to determine from the hazardous chemicals kept in inventory, gather the MSDSs for the chemicals. MSDSs describe the hazards that a chemical may present, list the precautions to take when handling, storing, or using the substance, and outline emergency and first-aid procedures.

## What special equipment should be provided for emergencies?

Employees may need personal protective equipment to evacuate during an emergency. Personal protective equipment must be based on the potential hazards in the workplace. Assess the workplace to determine potential hazards and the appropriate controls and protective equipment for those hazards. Personal protective equipment may include items such as the following:

- l Safety glasses, goggles, or face shields for eye protection;
- l Hard hats and safety shoes for head and foot protection;
- l Proper respirators;
- l Chemical suits, gloves, hoods, and boots for body protection from chemicals;
- l Special  body  protection  for  abnormal  environmental  conditions  such  as  extreme temperatures; and
- l Any other special equipment or warning devices necessary for hazards unique to your worksite.

## How do you choose appropriate safety equipment?

Consult with health and safety professionals before making any purchases.

Respiratory protection may be necessary if employees pass through toxic atmospheres of dust, mists, gases, or vapors, or through oxygen-deficient areas while evacuating.

## 11.6 SECURITY IN HOUSEKEEPING

## Introduction

We know by now that housekeeping personnel are spread across the hotel in pursuit of their cleaning  and  maintenance  duties.  They,  therefore,  become  the  ideal  eyes  and  ears  of  the organisation to detect any security threats to the organisation. They become a close ally with the security department that relies on their presence throughout the hotel. The main security concerns are:

- l Lost and Found (discussed in Lesson 6)
- l Guest Theft
- l Employee theft
- l Bomb Scare

## Guest Theft

Guest theft  is  a  reality  of  the  hotel  business.  Guests  take  hotel  items  as  souvenirs  or  plainly because the items in a hotel are useful at home. Thefts are usually from rooms where items like towels, vanity sets, soaps, bathrobes and slippers are useful for common use. Some hotels may look at such items as marketing strategies especially when items are monogrammed with the hotel logo. They may not mind items like vanity sets, soaps and guest stationery are taken. The hotel may build such costs into the room rate. But items as towels and bathrobes are a serious concern  because  of  their  cost  to  replace  them.  Housekeeping  personnel  take  the  following precautions to prevent guest theft:

Key control: Access to rooms is done by legitimate issue of keys. Guests who are registered into the hotel are provided keys to access their rooms. They are cautioned not to keep it lying around. When leaving the property they are required to hand their room keys to the receptionists or deposit them into secure key boxes at the reception. Master keys are controlled very strictly. Firstly, master keys have outsized key rings to prevent the keys from being pocketed. The outsized key  rings  force  the  bearer  to  hold  it  in  their  hand.  Secondly,  master  keys  are  issued  to  few legitimate personnel. They are the lobby manager and floor supervisor only. Each has to sign for them and register it into the log book. The movement of master keys is monitored closely. A master key lost is a major security threat to the property. Hotels may be forced to change the locks of the entire hotel at a great investment.

Suspicious movements: Housekeeping personnel are trained to observe suspicious movements and report it to the security. Floor crews must learn to recognize guests that are registered into the hotel. Room maids are not permitted to open guest room doors for any guests. Legitimate residents are required to use their own keys and not have the room maid to open their doors.

Departure procedure: Hotels have trained bell boys to give a quick glance at the room and bathroom before they remove guest baggage. They look for missing towels, blankets, vanity sets, pictures, etc. Room maids too will follow-up the procedure if they notice a departure taking place. It provides a chance to question the guest at the front-office cashier desk.

Standard issues to guest rooms: The ability to detect missing items is made possible by equipping rooms with standard number of items. So if a room has two bath towels the lobby or

## 460

room personnel will quickly  scan  the  bathroom  for  both  of  them.  Each  item  in  the  room  is standardised in numbers for easy control and detection.

Entry/Exit point: A guest room has only one entry/exit door. Windows are usually secured in centrally air-conditioned or heated properties. The housekeeping personnel have window keys to open them. This feature of construction reduces the element of theft. Room doors are provided with peep holes, door chain latch and double locking facilities to secure unauthorised entry when the guest is present.

The hotel business operates mostly on trust. In spite of the precautions given above, thefts do happen by few unscrupulous guests who are exceptions rather than the rule.

## Employee Theft

As in the case of guests, the employees find that most items used in a hotel are useful in the home as well, whether it is a towel, table napkin or a soap. A hotel reduces pilferage by adopting the following precautions:

Gate Pass: An employee is required to posses a gate pass, issued and authorised by the head of department whenever a hotel property is removed from the hotel. This gate pass is shown to the security officer at the time office from where employees exit and enter the hotel. Hotels provide the rule that all employees have only one entry and exit point to the hotel located at the back of the hotel where the time office is situated. The time office ensures that employees meticulously register their entry and exit on time cards.

Spot Checks: Security personnel conduct spot checks of employee hand bags at random to ensure that unauthorised items are not being taken out of the hotel. A hotel item in possession of an employee without a gate pass is considered as theft and liable to dismissal from the service. Security personnel make spot checks of employee lockers periodically to ensure that any hotel property is not stored there, other than the employees uniform. Uniforms are not permitted outside the property.

Limited Access: Employees have limited access to areas of the hotel. For example, a cook is not permitted to be on a guest floor nor a swimming pool attendant in the reception. The hotel provides uniforms to distinguish personnel in the hotel. All personnel are expected to be in their designated areas only. Only certain personnel are permitted on the guest floor. These are the room attendants, floor supervisors, laundry valets, room service waiters, security personnel, bell boys and maintenance staff. Each has distinguishing uniforms. Room attendants may open the guest room doors for these authorised personnel only after verification of their intentions. She has to be present when the guest is not in. Another aspect of limited access is the authority to enter stores. Only storekeepers and their helpers are permitted within stores and held totally accountable for items received and issued. Similarly, the keys to the housekeeping stores may be given to authorised supervisors only, just as the entry to the linen and uniform rooms is only open to the linen and uniform keepers only.

Par Stocks: Room attendants have water-tight par stocks of items on their maid carts that have to be accounted for at the end of their shifts. Similarly, guest rooms have par stocks as mentioned earlier. Room attendants are held accountable for a set of rooms and they have to ensure that guest room par stocks are maintained.

Bomb Threats: Terrorism is a new concern for all public buildings. Hotels are prime targets for explosions by radical groups who want to make a statement. Housekeeping personnel must be alert to suspicious objects around, especially those that are unaccompanied. Room attendants are trained to report anything suspicious in guest rooms whether they be drugs, excessive amounts of money, arms and bomb-like structures.  A  hotel  would  have  worked  out  an  emergency  plan (discussed earlier in this chapter) to meet these threats. Most threats are just threats and do not require alerting guests.
