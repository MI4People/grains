## 1.3 HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY

Hospitality  industry  is  a  wider  term  for  a  broad  variety  of  service  industry  including hotels, restaurants, catering establishments and many more. This industry is very diverse and  global  and  catering  to  all  the  needs  of  travel  related  activity  it  is  expected  to  be US$3.5 trillion industry in world economy. Hospitality refers to the relationship between guest and host; it also refers to being hospitable.

Some define hospitality as -the business of helping people to feel welcome and relaxed and to enjoy themselves‖ (Discover Hospitality, 2015, ) Hospitality is treating people like you  would  want  to  treated  when  you  are  travelling  in  other  words  it  means  making  a tourist  feels  totally  welcome  not  only  as  your  guest  but  also  as  the  guest  of  the  entire family i.e. family of hotel.

Hospitality  can  be  defined  as  deliberate,  planned  and  sustained  effort  to  establish  and maintain  mutual  understanding  between  an  organization  and  public  i.e.  the  business  of

making  and  keeping  friends  and  promoting  an  atmosphere  of  better  understanding  the word hospitality is derived from Latin word -Hospitalitias‖. Reception, welcome and in general the treatment of guest or a stranger in the most friendly manner is hospitality. In most of the countries all over the world guest is received with a great amount of courtesy and warmth is provided with entertainment. The basic concept of hospitality is to make the guest feels that they are always welcome‖'.

Although the basic concept of hospitality has remained the same but with the passage of time and development of technology and science, the need and wants of travelers have changed  greatly  thus  providing  numerous  services  and  facilities  in  terms  of accommodation and other basic needs such as food and beverages. Simply putting, the hospitality industry is the combination  of  the  accommodation  and  food  and beverage groupings, collectively making up the largest segment of the industry.

The  hospitality  industry  is  a  part  of  a  larger  enterprise  known  as  travel  and  tourism industry.  The  travel  and  tourism  industry  is  a  vast  group  of  business  with  one  goal  in common : providing necessary or desired services to travelers. Advances in transportation enabled more people to travel greater distances at less cost spreading tourism across the globe.  From  modest  origins,  hospitality  and  tourism  rose  to  become  two  of  the  largest worldwide industries.

## 1.3.1Origin of Hospitality Industry

The  origin  and  growth  of  hospitality  industry  is  direct  outcome  of  travel  and  tourism. Warriors or traders were the early travelers but they did not have hotels to accommodate them.  The  warriors  used  tents  but  the  merchants  seeking  to  trade  tools,  clothing  and livestock,  traded  merchandise  for  lodging.  The  inns  offered  little  more  than  a  cot  or  a bench in the corner of a room or a stable which were unhygienic too. Most of them were private  residences  of  the  local  residents  that  offered  temporary  residence  or  lodging  to strangers runed by husband and wife team who provided large halls to travelers where they were supposed to make their own bed and sleep on the floor guests used to stayed in large  communal  rooms  where  sanitation  and  privacy  were  non-existent.  After  the establishment of money in 6th century BC, in keeping was one of the first commercial enterprises and hospitality was one of the first services for which money was exchanged.

Throughout the world they were known by different names such as: Dharamshalas  and Sarai in India, ryokans in Japan,  paradors in Spain, pousadas in Portugal, coffee house in America, taverens and inns in Europe, cabarets and hostelries in France, mansionis  and hospital in Switzerland, phatnal in Greece and relay house in China.

In  the  third  century  AD,  Roman Empire developed an extensive system of brick paved roads throughout Europe and Asia minor. Small road side lodges were constructed due to increase in the road transport. During the Industrial Revolution in 1700s, the Europeans began  to  combine  food  and  beverage  service  with  lodging.  No  attention  was  given  to sanitation and beds as well as rooms had to be shared with other travelers. These early European  inns  were  unsuitable  for  aristocrats.  To  accommodate  wealthy  travelers, luxurious structures were erected. These offered private rooms, individual sanitation and all  comforts  of  a  European  castle.  These  elegant  new  establishments  later  adopted  the French name for mansion, ‗hotel'. The rates they charged were very high and well beyond the means of common citizens.

## 1.4 TOURISM INDUSTRY

To understand the origin and development of Hotel industry we need to understand its two pillars - Hospitality industry and Tourism Industry.

What Is Tourism? Before going through the details of the growth of the hotel industry let's look back and try to understand its origin i.e. from why people travel or undertake tourism, let's understand what this term means- The word tour is derived from the Latin word  tornus  meaning  a  tool  for  making  a  circle.  Tourism  in  simple  is  defined  as  the movement  of  people  from  their  normal  place  of  residence  to  another  place  with  the intention  to  return  for  a  minimum  period  of  twenty  four  hours  to  a  maximum  of  six months for the sole purpose of leisure and pleasure.

It  can  also  be  defined  as  -It  is  the  movement  of  people  from  their  normal  place  of residence & work for a period of not less than 24 hours and not more than 1 year‖.

W.T.O.

According to Henniker & Kroff tourism is -The sum of phenomenon and relationship arising from the travel as it does not lead to permanent residence and is not connected to any earning activity.‖

The League of Nations in 1937 defined tourism as -Tourism covers the social activity of those  who  travel  for  a  period  of  24  hours  or  more  in  a  country  other  than  the  one  the person usually lives in.‖

According to Tourism Society of Britain -Tourism is a temporary, short term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during their stay at these destinations, including day visit & excursion.

Thus there are a number of ways tourism can be defined, and for this reason, the United Nations  World  Tourism  Organization (UNWTO) embarked  on  a  project  from  2005  to 2007  to  create  a  common  glossary  of  terms  for  tourism.  It defines  tourism  as  follows: -Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people  to  countries  or  places  outside  their  usual  environment  for  personal  or business/professional  purposes.  These  people  are  called  visitors  (which  may  be  either tourists  or  excursionists;  residents  or  non-residents)  and  tourism  has  to  do  with  their activities,  some  of  which  imply  tourism  expenditure  (United  Nations  World  Tourism Organization, 2008).‖

Tourist - it's meaning: Using this definition, we can see that tourism is the movement of people  for  a  number  of  purposes  (whether  business  or  pleasure).  Building  on  the definition  of  tourism,  a  commonly  accepted  description  of  a tourist is  -someone  who travels at least 80 km from his or her home for at least 24 hours, for business or leisure or other reasons‖ (LinkBC, 2008, p.8). It can also be defined by UNWTO as -People who travel  to  and  stay  in  place  outside  their  usual  environment  for  not  more  than  one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity  remunerated from within the place visited. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (1995) helps us break down this definition further by stating tourists can be:

International Tourism - When people visit a foreign country, it is referred to as international tourism. In order to travel to a foreign country one requires passport, visa, health documents, foreign exchange etc. International tourist may be inbound or outbound:

Inbound -non-residents travelling in a given country, i.e. refers to tourist of outside origin entering a particular country

Outbound -  residents  of  one  country travelling  in  another  country  i.e. refers  to  tourist  travelling  from  the  country  of  their  origin  to  another country.

Domestic  Tourism: The  residents  of  a given  country  travelling  only  within that country.  Travelling  within  the  same  country  is  easier  because  it  does  not require  formal  travel  documents  and  other  formalities  like  compulsory  health check and foreign exchange etc.

## 1.4.1 Purpose of Travel

It is important to study here the factors that commonly promote tourism during all periods i.e.  what  motivates  people  to  move  or  to  travel.  Today  With  disposable  income,  faster transport  and  greater  time  for  leisure,  people  have  ventured  into  new  horizons  which seemed only dreams till yesterday. Some of the reasons for travelling are as follows:

Sightseeing: This  is  a  strong  reason  to  travel.  Sightseeing  is  visiting  places  of  interest. International  culture  attracts  men  and  their  exploration  always  fascinates  him.  Culture includes the away people live the their history cuisines, arts, handicrafts languages etc . tour operators therefore organize tour packages to meet the need of the clientage.

Leisure: This  comes  as  a  strong  motivation  in  highly  stressed  work  life.  Leisure  is  a passive recreation where people just want to put up their feet's and relax. There are many sources  of  leisure  like  weather  is  the  major  attraction  as  some  like  cold  weather  while others  get  fascinated  by  deserts  and  sea  beaches.  Spas  are  creations  of  new  age  health conscious people.

Religious travel: This has always fascinated humankind from ancient times. We know of pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the Christians and the Haj to Mecca for the Hindus, etc. This involves large-scale travelling with millions of travelers at a time.

Religious travelers observe ambience and have very little needs. Some may have dietary restriction like vegetarian food or foods without some ingredients. They may want prayer rooms and perhaps a priest of their faith on premises

Business: The movement of people for business reasons has been a great motivator for people to travel from the beginning merchants travelled with their merchandise from one city to another city for trading. We have evidence of trade between Egypt, Phoenicia, and Indus Valley Mesopotamia. Naturally business has become more sophisticated now days. With  countries  breaking  down  trade  barriers,  companies  can  go  global  in  terms  of possession  of  business  in  other  countries  or  through  franchise.  Business  travelers  are moneyed  and  therefore  require  the  following  services  wherever  they  travel:  Hotels  of

quality, Unique food and beverage facilities to entertain their business clients, Car on rent etc

Governmental  Travel: Governmental  travel  has  become  important  to  foster  better understanding  and  trade  between  nations.  Today,  countries  want  to  maintain  good diplomatic  relations  with  other  countries  to  promote  trade  and  culture  and  goodwill. Regular travelling under exchange programmers takes place to keep in touch and to help each other in the progress of mankind and in improving mutual relationship. Government delegations  are  normally  hosted  by  the  state  who  may  book  hotel  accommodation  to house them. Some host a state banquet in the premises. Obviously such groups will need security, translation services, multilingual front-office staff and perfect service.

Education: Education as a reason for travel was a state-sponsored tradition throughout the  ancient  times.  We  know  that  Hindu  temples,  Buddhist  monasteries  and  Islamic madarsas  went  beyond  religion  to  educate  their  people.  They  provide  boarding  and lodging to visiting scholars.

Health: Health has become a new reason for travel. The purpose to travel for health is: Many travel to access the best hospitals worldwide for specialized medical, dental  and surgical care. This type of travel arisen of the high cost of healthcare in the industrialized nations.

People  visit  health  resorts  to  get  into  better  shape.  Spas  have  converted  their  natural mineral springs into luxurious resorts to enjoy and rejuvenate their body.

Another variant are the health camps where people are introduced to meditation and yoga along with a diet regimen. These camps are truly meant to re-shape the body, mind and soul.

Sports : This has become a huge industry where people travel is common amongst sports person  with  their  tremendous  fan  following  like  huge  championships,  world  cups  and Olympic games are well organize to take the traveler enjoy the sports. Hobby sports like fishing, sailing and adventure sports like river rafting, trekking have now a day become a brilliant dollar industry as people love to travel and enjoy the sports that fascinates them. Game parks are the men made attractions motivate people to travel.

Reunion: Reunions  are  a  major  reason  for  travel.  They  are  created  for  the  following reasons:

Overseas  employment:  With  people  working  in  other  countries  due  to  global opportunities of employment, the return home for family reunions is a strong motivation.

Overseas education: Similarly, children who left home for international work, education and assignments touch base with their loved ones at Christmas, Thanks giving, Easter or national holidays and religious festivals.

Fraternity get-togethers: Another type of reunion is the alma of schools, colleges and higher universities. These reunions take place when students have advanced in age and reached economic self-sufficiency to finance these get-togethers anywhere in the world, especially in exotic locations.

Military unions are another reason for travel.

Special interest groups: Special interest groups are those who travel in pursuit of their hobby. There is no limit to special interest groups who have connected with each other over the web to make the exchange of interest easier continents. Some popular choices are:

Ornithologists who  pursue  their  interest  in  rare  birds  some  of  which  are  only found in certain locations. Many may opt for travelling to appreciate both old and modern architectural constructions.

Wildlife  has  become  a  popular  interest  and  people  go  to  safari  parks  where animals are conserved from extinction. The Kenya National Park is world famous for  African  wild  animals;  the Jim  Corbett  Park is  known  for  the  Kumaon  tiger; while  enthusiasts  handle  around  Kaziranga  National  Park  in  India  see  the  onehorned rhino. Whether they ride by elephants or modern utility vehicles, the thrill is immense.

Shopping: This is  a  another major attraction for anyone visiting new places. There are many objectives when shopping: like

To gather mementos of their visit to a place. For Example - travelers would buy cuckoo clocks in Switzerland or the Masai Spear in Kenya.

To get bargain. People seek bargains at places like Singapore and Dubai who have set the lead in making the state a destination for shopping. With innovative shopping festivals they attract people from around the world.

To purchase commercial equipment.

Curiosity:The curiosity of a person moving from known are as to unknown areas, from known cultures to unknown cultures motivates him to travel to gain new memories.

Visit friends and relatives (VFR):This has also been an important reason for travel to meet their friends and relatives, since people travel by their own conveyance thee days, mainly roadside catering and motels etc are benefited by this in most of the cases.

Fairs & Festivals: The sea also motivates people to travel like national and international fairs  such  as  Pushkar  Mela,  craft  Mela,  International  Trade  Fairs,  several  Expos  and festival like Holi Diwali, Eid etc.

## 1.4.2 Importance of Tourism

The importance of tourism, therefore, is broad and encompasses a number of activities.

Economic Importance: Tourism industry is one of the influential type of industry in the world. According to -Lickorish and Kershaw‖ of the American Chamber of Commerce, -There  are  three  ways  basically  of  increasing  the  wealth  and  business  activities  of  a country  and  they  are  agriculture  development,  industrial  development  and  tourism development of the country. Here it is important to understand the term  Multiplier Effect:

Tourism  Multiplier .  As  the  tourist  comes  to  visit  the  destination,  he  spends money  on  fooding,  lodging  and  purchasing  local  items  etc,  Money  spent  by  a

tourist, is not exhausted in a single stroke. It continues to circulate in the economy through  at  a  descending  rate  for  sometimes  before  it  finally  disappears  because some of it is  exported  outside  the  country  for  import  of  goods  and  services  for sometime before it finally disappears. The multiplier process is possible because of  the  fact  that  one  man's  consumption  is  another  man's  income.  Thus  when  a tourist spends say Rs. 1,000/- on food, entertainment and other activities, this in turn becomes for F and B department, the entertainment department and any other department  which  provided  the  product  or  services.  The  money  does  not  get blocked here because of the fact that money is considered as a liquid asset. These respective  departments  then  spend  this  money  on  various  commodities.  This consumption  by  the  departments  then  again  becomes  income  for  some  other people. Thus the multiplier process continues and trickles down in to the nation's economy.

Foreign Currency :It is a source of earning foreign currency by the money spent by the international tourists

Sources of public as well as private income: Tourism industry is the source of income for both public also well as private sector government charges tax, sales tax, service tax etc. which is known as government revenue is the income of public. And handicraft, arts etc  are  the  things  that  attract  tourist  and  most  of  them  buy  them  and  the  seller  makers some profit which is called private income.

Tax earnings. :The  governments of almost all countries have always shown interest in the  financial  gains  through  tourism  industry.  The  infusion  of  tourist  earning  in  to  an economy as local income makes it accessible to income and other taxes. Depending upon the tax and fiscal policies govern derives sustainable income from tourist industries and direct and indirect taxes are levied on different forms of income and economic activities.

National Economy: It  directly  helps  in  developing  the  economy  of  the  country  as  the tourists spend money while staying, coming and visiting a country or destination.

Employment Opportunities: Tourism industry is also one of the influential sectors. It generates  employment  opportunities.  It  provides  employment  to  unskilled,  semi-skilled and skilled manpower. Guide, load man etc are the personal or labour required in Tourism industry.

Infrastructural Development: The infrastructural development of the country is another important  benefit  of  tourism.  Although  the  investment  made  in  a  country  on  the infrastructure  either  by  the  government  or  private  sector(whichever  the  case  may  be  as per the policy of the government) may be attributed and expenditure towards the tourism sector,  yet  the  benefit  are  denied  by  other  industries  also.  For  Example,  roads,  water supply, airports and other public amenities are not only for tourism sector but also stand by all the sectors of economy infrastructure development not only means creasing new infrastructure but also include the development of the present infrastructure and extending it  to  meet  the  need  of  this  hour.  At  the  time  of  new  infrastructure  and  the  developed existing  infrastructure  open  new  services  and  amenities  bring  in  new  and  improved services and amenities to the local residents which are not even thought of by them.

Cultural Exchange: Tourism is a big motivator for the promotion of culture and spreads the cultural values of the host country to the visitors, who in turn when they go back talk and discuss with others. Culture of a country includes various things such as life style, music,  dance,  food,  architecture,  art  and  many  other  such  things.  Tourism  helps  in spreading all these to various parts of the world over. India is one country which has very old and rich heritage and culture and is probably the only country with diversified culture. Properly planned it can be the biggest tourism asset of country. Thus Tourism industry facilities cultural exchange tourist carry over various cultural concepts of other countries where they visit. Thereby the cultures of different places can be known and exchanged through  tourism.  Local  people  can  learn  their  language,  art,  skill,  culture  etc  and  vice versa.

Regional  Development: Regional  development  is  another  very  important  aspect  of impact of tourism. The more the region or area is visited by that tourist (both domestic and  international)  the  more  the  area  or    region  needs  to  be  developed  and  thus development has to be in all fields and sector, be it historical places, hotels, picnic spots, roads  or  airports,  railway  connections  and  environment,  etc.  Such  expenditure  is  of special significance in marginal areas which are relatively isolated, economically under developed and has unemployment problems.

Educational significance of tourism :  Not  only  in  the  present  age  has  tourism  been  of great  importance  for  education  always.  Many  such  example  of  university  such  as, Takshila and Nalanda, etc. are there in India and also like Alexandria and Greece have been  centers  of  education  in  ancient  tunes.  Its  beneficial  effects  are  in  the  close  and friendly contact between people of different races.

Image Building of Nation: Tourism helps in building the image of country; of course the same image will be carried over what we project. For Example, a tourist coming to India may  carry  with  him  a  mixed  image  of  good  and  bad  after  visiting  the  country.  The historical places and monuments, etc. form a good image while at the same time the way they are maintained their approach roads (which if are poorly maintained) the inadequate transportation  facilities,  poor  accommodation  facilities,  etc.  might  project  a  bad  image. The age old culture and religion and heritage may project a good image while the greedy priests  and  beggar  and  touts  at  such  places  will  project  a  negative  image.  Each  year millions  of  people  travel  to  foreign  countries,  and  their  visit  afford  opportunities  to understand each other.

National Integration: It  helps  in  development  of  peace,  oneness  and  unity  among  the people of a nation.

Environmental Awareness: People become aware on environmental neatness, protection and peace in order to develop tourism.

Foreign Languages: By the help of tourism, we can get chance to learn the languages of different places and countries.

## 1.4.3  The Evolution of Travel

The history of travel is a great landmark in the field of tourism industry. Travel is as old as mankind. From the time of immemorial, people started the traveling due to the various reason. It may be the purpose of the economic, social, cultural, spiritual achievement of the human being. Travel in the earlier times, however, was not undertaken for the purpose of  pleasure since the motive was not to seek any holiday from the work situation. The primary  motive  for  which  travel  was  undertaken  related  to  trade,  commerce  and  the activities associated with it. No travel formalities existed as there were no frontiers. The history of travel can be summarized into:

The Early Travel: Since the beginning of the civilization there have the evidence that, human beings were moving in the search of food and shelter which is the basic feature of mankind. We have the historical evidence about the movement of people since the time immemorial.. In Neolithic age of 10,000 B.C. mankind started the settled life, agriculture, and  so  many  activities  for  the  betterment  of  comfortable  life.In  around  Egypt  sailing vessels were built in 4000 B.C. Sumerians knew the use of wheel & money around 3500 BC and used it in trade and commerce purpose. Shulgi of Babylonia constructed the rest houses for the travelers. Thus the trade and commerce relations were developed from East to West. Westerners imported the spices, silk etc. from the Easterners.

Silk  Routes. Thus  Trade  first  motivated  to  travel  and  travelers  needed  more  and  more comfort  during  their  travel,  like  accommodation  catering,  health  etc.  As  a  result  Pvt. Organizations were emerged and it resulted in the following developments.

-  Development of creative activities.
-  Service to travelers constituted the local economic growth.
-  Cultural and Commercial contact.
-  Exchange of ideas and thinking.

Pleasure Travel: After the ending part of the early travel, the Rome Empire reached their apex of the glory. Hence it is marked that the Roman people started the concept of the travel  for  pleasure.  They  travelled  as  they  have  ample  money  and  time.  Besides  that Roman people were Best Patron of art, learning and literature etc. There are examples of the  silk  route  from  Mediterranean  sea  to  Pacific  Ocean  consist  of  12,000  Km.  It  was connected by the older prosperous cities like Rome, Greece, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, India,  China,  like  this.  Some  intellectuals  of  that  period  remained  busy  in  creative activities due to their curiosity. The pleasure travel period came to an end due to the fall of the Roman Empire in (400-500 A.D.)

Events  of  Traveling  in  Ancient  India: Pilgrim  travel  assumed  a  great  importance  in India also. Ashoka traveled a great deal in his eagerness to spread doctrines of Buddha. Ashoka and his entourage first traveled to Nepal starting from Patliputra than to Lumbini Gardens, followed by the Kapilvastu, than Sarnath, from here he travel to Gaya, where Buddha got enlightenment. Through his travels, Emperor Ashoka had special memorials set up at each spot and also he set up the rest houses where traveler could rest. Later on following  his  legacy  several  other  rulers  also  built  institutions  and  Dharamshalas  for travelers. Rest  houses,  monasteries  and  temples  were  also  built  for  pilgrims.

Earliest travelers to the Indian Soil: Perhaps the earliest travelers from distant lands to the Indian soil were the trading Persians. Evidences of Caravan of Persians visiting India lies engraved in the inscriptions dating to the Persian king Daurius. During the rule of the Guptas, there was free access to the ports along the Western Coast, seaborne commerce with Europe through Egypt was yet another reason for travel in and around the country. The greatest traveler remembered from the distant past is Hieun-tsang. A devout Chinese Buddhist, he made the perilous journey to India around AD. 633. His main mission was to collect  and  translate  ancient  Buddhist  scriptures.  Some  other  notable  traveler  were Alexander  the  Great,  Marco  Polo,  Benjamin  of  Tudela,  Ibn  Batutah,  Francisco  Friar, Alfonso D' Albuquerque and Mark Twain.

Other Travelers: like  Vasco  da  Gama  traveled  from  sea  routes  of  Western  Europe  to India in 1498 and Ferdinand Magellan shipped around the world. Francisco Friar, John of Monte Corvino also visited India. The first great sailor to the westward circumnavigation of  the  world  was  Francis  Drake  who  knighted  by  Queen  Elizabeth  I  in  the  year  1581. From 1768 to 1779 Captain James Cook made three long voyages to the Pacific.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

rise to wide range of commercial activities that have acquired industry proportions. Thus Travel and tourism is made up of different components which work together to provide holidays and other travel products to clients.

These are most important components in tourism industry are:

-  Accommodation
-  Transport
-  Attractions
-  Travel agents
-  Tour operators
-  Ancillary services

The components of travel and tourism can be broadly divided into six key areas:

Accommodation  (Lodging  and  Catering): This  components  consists  of  those  who provide accommodation to the people in the form of hotels, resorts, apartments, camps, guest houses etc. The accommodation may be marketed individually or through the tour operators  in  the  form  of  package.  Direct  marketing  may  require  huge  costs  on advertisement  and  selling  through  a  tour  operator  guarantees  the  occupancy  rate throughout a holiday season. These service providers also take care of the catering needs of the people b providing them huge cafeterias, various fast food outlets in house or in the form of a local restaurants or food joints.

Various Kinds of Transport: Transport providers are those operating any major form of transport. They could be airlines, cruise lines, car rentals, and rail companies. A tourist's choice of transport would depend on the travel budget, destination, time, purpose of the tour, and convenience to the point of destination.

Tourist Attractions: The principle of attraction is to establish the need for the attraction in a particular location to invite more clientele. It may be a huge theme park, a museum, a gallery,  a  heritage  building,  an  educational  center  etc.  Many  countries  see  the  need  to have  one  or  more  visitor  attraction  in  the  area  to  widen  their  appeal  and  attract  huge potential tourist.

Travel  Agent: A  travel  agent  provides  information  to  the  people  on  various  travel destinations,  advises  them  of  available  holiday  packages  to  suit  their  tastes  and  budget and  chart  their  travel  plan.  He  would  generally  sell  the  travel  associated  products  like currency exchange, car rentals, insurance etc. A travel agency is tailing business that sells travel related products and services particularly package tours to clients on behalf of the suppliers.

Tour Operators: A tour operates or assembles the various elements of tour .it combines the  tour  and  travel  components  to  create  holiday.  The  most  example  of  tour  operator product would be a rail ticket plus a pick up from station to hotel and the services of local representatives all for one price. Tour operators offer holiday packages which comprise of:

-  Travel like by rail, road or air.
-  Accommodation like hotels, resorts, apartments, guesthouses

-  Travel  services  like  airport  pick  and  drop,  sightseeing,  excursions  etc. These  tour  operators  may  be  the  wholesale  operators  who  operate  tours  only through retail travel agencies or they may be direct sell operators who market their product directly to the public.

Information  &  Guiding:  (Ancillary  services) The  tourist  information  and  guidance providers  include  a  number  of  service  providers  such  as  those  offering  insurance, recreational,  communication,  and  banking  services;  government  agencies;  tour  guides; industry associations; packaging agents; ticketing agents; and holiday sellers.

## 1.5 Evolution and Growth of the Hotel Industry in the World

The invention of the currency and the wheel sometime in the fifth century BC is regarded as  the  two  main  factors  that  led  to  the  emergence  of  inn-keeping  and  hospitality  as  a commercial activity. While Europe can safely be regarded as the cradle of organized hotel business, it is in the American continent that one sees the evolution of the modern hotel industry over the past century. From the rudimentary ancient inns to the present day stateof-the-art establishments that provide everything under the sun to the modern traveler, the hotel industry has come a long way. The origin and growth of the hotel industry in the world can be broadly studied under the following periods:

-  Ancient Era
-  Grand Tour
-  Modern Era

Ancient Era: It  is  believed  that  inns  were  originated  in  6th  century  B.C.  but  the  real beginning of inn in the history goes back to 12th century, though existence of the oldest sheltering system was seen in Pompeii, south Italy in 79 A.D. Rome was considered holy, place and epicenter of loyalty to all religious people in Europe. For such pilgrimage, the destination to Rome had gradually been increased, and there was a great need of shelter for such people who were travelling all across and reaching their to visit the holy place. Hence the earlier recorded evidence of the hospitality facilities in Europe dates back to 500  BC.  Ancient  cities,  such  as  Corinth  in  Greece,  had  a  substantial  number  of establishments that offered food and drink as well as beds to travelers. The inns of the biblical era were of primitive type, offering a cot or bench in the corner of a room and at times, even a stable. Travelers used to stay in a large hall. Privacy and personal sanitation were  non-existent.  In  the  third  century  AD,  numerous  lodging  premises  mushroomed along the extensive network of brick-paved roads throughout Europe and minor Asia (part of Asia adjoining Europe). The lodging houses were known as mansionis during that time

These  conditions  prevailed  for  several  hundred  years,  till  the  Industrial  Revolution  in England  led  to  the  development  of  railways  and  steamships,  making  travelling  more efficient,  comfortable and faster. The Industrial Revolution also bought about a shift in the focus of travel that became more business -oriented than educational or social. Inn keeping  was  now  changed  into  commercial  enterprise  providing  room,  food  and

entertainment for travelers.  Inn  keepers earned profit from providing  lodging  and catering services to different travelers. And by the 16th century, the concept  of  hospitality was developed.

The  real  beginning  of the semi-modern lodging  industry  may be traced back to 1640 A.D.  when  the  first passenger carrying state  coach  began  to operate in England and similarly in other areas of Europe's  and  an organized hotel keeping,  as  we  see  it today, was taken up by

Figure 1.2 A Swiss Chalet

emerging nations of Europe, especially Switzerland. In early England, Inns and Taverns

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

were  normally  considered  finer  establishment  and  were  reserved  for  the  nobility  and clergy.  Similarly,  in  Switzerland  the  chalets  (small  cottage)  refer  fig  1.2,  which  were patronized by the aristocrats, took the shape of hotel that provided a variety of services. Between  1750  and  1825,  inns  in  Britain  gained  the  reputation  of  being  the  finest hospitality establishment.

Grand Tour: The second half of the eighteenth century, prior to the French Revolution (1789-99), is referred as the ‗golden era of travel' as the popularity of the ‗Grand Tour' gave  a  big  push  to  the  hotel  industry.  In  those  days,  a  Grand  Tour  of  the  European continent  constituted  an  indispensable  element  of  the  education  of  scions  of  wealthy families  in  Britain.  As  this  tour  often  lasted  several  years,  it  was  a  good  business opportunity  for  people  in  the  prominent  cities  of  France,  Italy,  Germany,  Austria, Switzerland and Ireland to establish lodging, transportation and recreation facilities. Farsighted  entrepreneurs,  who  smelt  money  in  the  exercise,  enveloped  the  skills  of hospitality and pioneered the modern hotel industry.

Prominent  among  the  hotels  that  emerged  during  this  period  were  Dolder  Grand  in Zurich. The Imperial in Vienna, refer fig 1.3 the Vir Jahreszeiten in Hamburg and Des Bergues  in  Geneva.  In  1841,  a  simple  cabinet  maker,  Thomas  Cook  refer  fig  1.4 organized  a  rail  tour  from  Leicester  to  Louthborough  and  immortalized  himself  as  the world's first tour operator.

Modern  Era: Industrial  Revolution  in  England  in  the  mid  Eighteenth  century  was considered to be the period of development of modern tourism, several new inventions and changes were seen on the pages of world history like Rail Transport, Sea etc

With  the  invention  of  transport  it  become  easy  for  people  to  travel  from  one  place  to another  but  with  the  two  World  Wars  specially  the  World  War  II    leads  to  toll  on  the growth of hospitality industry, the massive destruction caused by the war leading to heavy economic  depression  proved  to  be  a  major  setback  for  the  travel  business  that  is  why European countries shows a slow growth of hotel industry after World War II .But  with

the development of aircrafts and commercial passenger flights encouraged travel across the globe ,accelerated the growth of hotel industry

Now it is the American Business who started investing in the growth of Hotel industry and literarily changing the fact of the hospitality industry with their innovative ideas and aggressive marketing skills. The opening of the City Hotel in New York  in 1794 marked the beginning of present day hotel industry, which was giant building with 73 rooms.

Before the establishment of City Hotel, lodging facilities in the America continent were based  on  the  foot  prints  of  European  styles  taverns  or  Inns,  the  City  Hotel  however triggered  a  race  and  new  era  of  hotels  among  the  American  hoteliers  resulting  in  the construction  of  large  hotels  like  Coffee  House  in  Boston  and  the  second  City  Hotel  in Baltimore ,Mansion House in Philadelphia etc

The next in name was the Tremont house of Boton refer fig 1.4 is another landmark in the development of hotel industry as it is considered to be first luxury hotel with170rooms and  it  was  the  first  to  provides  locks,  indoor  plumbing,  running  water  and  bathing facilities  besides  providing,  a  bowl,  pitcher with  free  soaps in  its  room. It  was  also  the first to provide front office services like bell boy and reception, it was also

Throughout  the  19th  century  their  remain  a contest  among  the  hotel  i.e.  is  to  build  better larger  and  most  luxurious  hotels  continued. Several other hotels came into existence like The Grand  Pacific,  The  Palmer  House,  and  the Sherman House in Chicago as well as the Palace with 800 rooms in San Fransico were built.

Another landmark hotel was built in 1908, it was

the  first  business  hotel  ,  The  Statler  Hotel  in  Buffalo  refer  fig  1.5,  New  York  was  a beautiful 450 rooms magnificent multi storied  property was pioneer in many- it provided attached bathroom with hot and cold running water in each room , electric lamp on the desk, and radio in each room.

The year of 1930's again saw the great depression in the liquidity of most of the hotels in

America. The Hotel industry than continue to show a slow and steady growth in arround1940 and1950's.with new properties and changes coming in the hotels.

The  increase  in  automobile  travel  in  around  1950 led  to  the  rise  of  motor  hotels  or  motels  -  a  new category  in  the  hotel  industry.  The  motels  offered lodging  basic  fooding  and  free  parking  facilities, served as rest houses for people travelling between two destinations or tourist destinations. The following  decades  saw  the  growth  of  motels  on

Gradually with the passage of time there evolved several country wide and international chains Recently hotel industries are coming up with new concepts and luxuries which can be offered to the guest, sky is the limit for it hotels today can be found underwater, over water on trees, capsule hotels and may more.

## 1.6 Evolution and Growth of Hotel Industry in the India

In India the concept of shelter for travelers is not new. In fact, it is as old as its recorded in history though the origin of hotel industry in India cannot be fixed into particular time frame as The historical records are replete with mention of viharas, dharamshalas, sarais, musafirkhanas,  etc.  because  as  per  the  sources  it  has  started    showing  its  marks  from during Indus valley civilization  and Vedic Era. It is believed that in older days  people used to travel mainly for pilgrimage and trade. The concept of Char Dhaam (visiting the religious places located in all four corners of India) or all the religious places in India are the  important  indicators  of  the  significance  according  to  pilgrimage  by  our  ancestors. Even Ancient texts and literature and also in Hindu mythology there are many references to  travel  and  the  provision  of  accommodation  facilities  for  travelling  pilgrimages  and traders by the authorities of those days.

Ancient India was called as -Bird of the Gold‖ as it was well known for its richness in silk,  spices,  gems  stones  and  gold  and  records  of  famous  travelers  have  shown  that several  rulers  have  got  attracted  and  have  established  trading  relations  with  different countries.

Thus movement of people for both political and pilgrimage stressed the need for better and improved facilities to cater to the varied needs of the various classes of the society.In India, development of lodging and catering can also be attributed also to the legacy left by people  belonging  to  different  cultures  and  ethnic  groups  who  have  ruled  her. Development of Hotels in India as we see it today is chiefly due to the British, who had introduced hotels and restaurants similar to those found in Europe.With the revolution in the modes of transport leading to the evolution of hotel industry in the world development is seen in India also which is divided into three Periods/Era:

Ancient Era or Medieval Era: The beginning of hospitality sector in India starts with the  belief  of  -Atithi    Devo    Bhava‖  (Guest  is  God).  While  it  is  not  clear  that  when hospitality  emerged  in  as  commercial  activity  in  India  there  are  a  proofs  of accommodation facilities for  travelers  and  guests  though  not  as  organized  as  we  see  it today.  The ancient Buddhist monks were probably the first to institutionalize the concept of a shelter in India. The cave temples scattered all over the south-western region of India have both a chaitya (sanctuary) for worship and prayer and a vihara (monastery). These monks, although living in their quiet surroundings, away from towns and villages, were nevertheless mindful of the needs of travelers and pilgrims who found shelter and food at these  monasteries.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  these  monasteries  are  located  on  the ancient  trade  routes  between  important  deities  of  the  region.  It  is  gathered  from  some inscriptions that merchants gave liberal donations for the construction and maintenance of these establishments. Mere charity was obviously not the motivation in these displays of generosity. The trader travelled with their merchandise and money on these routes and the viharas  were  their  hotels.  In  the  medieval  period  this  ancient  institution  gradually assumed  a  more  secular  character.  Although  religious  centers  invariably  had dharamshalas  and  musafir  khanas  attached  to  them,  the  caravanserai  appeared  as  an exclusive traveler's lodge with a nanbai or cook attached with it.

With the passage of time and with increase in movement of people from one to another several  lodging  houses  were  built.  In  India  lodging  houses  in  were  known  as -Dharamshala‖  (Religion  House/School)  which  were  taken  care  by  local  resident  and were  built  in  and  around  village  chaupals,  which  served  as  the  meeting  ground  for villagers  to  plan  and  discuss  various  social  welfare  and  development  measures.  Theses becomes the places of lodging as travelers  started  putting  up  camp  there  due  to  safety reasons.  Gradually  with  the  help  of  zamindars  and  other  influential  people  permanent structure of Dharamshala were build for the travelers. Hence they were provided with safe and secure place to relax and spend the night.

In the medieval period between 11and13th centuries many sarai and musafirkhanas were build  primarily  as  the  resting  place  for  the  travelers  while  slowly  and  gradually,  the medieval  period  in  the  ancient  institution  gradually  assumed  a  more  secular  character. Although  religious  centers  invariably  had  Dharamshala  and  musafirkhanas  attached  to

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

them, the caravanserai appeared as an exclusive traveler's lodge with a nanbai or cook attached with it.

Besides  that  Sher  Shah  Suri,  the  Afghan  Emperor  and  the  builder  of  the  Grand  Trunk Road,  is  credited  with  having  built  caravanserais  at  regular  intervals  all  along  this highway  creating  favorable  conditions  for  commerce  and  travel.  However,  he  was  not alone in this venture. The slave or Mamluk dynasty and later The Mughals built the brick paved roads which make travel easy and thus opened Sarais all over their empire.

Later kings, rajas, nawabs, rich businessmen and philanthropists built sarais making travel less  painful  With  the  expansion  of  commerce,  travelling  became  profitable  and  with  it emerged  the  business  of  providing  comfortable  shelter  and  good  food  to  the  growing number of travelers.

Colonial Era: At approximately the same time, the inn was the Western counterpart of India's  sarais.  The  sarais  in  India  like  inns  in  Europe  or  the  stagecoach  stations  in  the USA of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries stood all along the well-travelled routes. They provided food and shelter to the travelers and fodder to their horses. The amenities these  early  hotels  offered  would  seem  to  us  to  be  primitive  but  they  conformed  to  the lifestyle of that age.

With the passage of time the age-old institution of the sarai or the inn adapted itself to the ever-changing and constantly growing requirements of the market and has evolved into the modern hotel. From the age of the bullock cart and horses through the age of the rail road into the era of the jumbo jet and supersonic aircraft, the hotel industry developed with the simultaneous development of transportation systems. It also reflects the standard of living and the lifestyle of the society in which it operates. The development of hotel industry in India is also continuous and satisfactory. The British introduced hotels in India mainly for their  own  use  or  for  foreign  visitors.  Thus  the  organized  existence  of  hotel industry  in  India  took  place  during  colonial  period  with  the  arrival  of  Europeans  or Britishers, who settled back in India.

Among the  first  such  Inns  were  Portuguese  Georges,  paddy  Goose's  which  opened  in Bombay but with the changes in the world these Inns disappeared and hotel came into existence The credit for opening the first Western-style hotel in India is in the name of British Hotel/ Victoria hotel in Mumbai in 1840 goes to Pallanjee Pestonjee who is the pioneer of Western-style hotels in India.

## 1.8 Classification of Hotels

The  Need  for  Classification  of  Hotel: Historically,  hotel  classification  systems  were developed to ensure safe and reliable lodging and food for travelers at a time when very few  such  trustworthy  establishments  existed.  With  the  unprecedented  growth  of international tourism in the past fifty years, during which hospitality has reach the status of  a  mature  industry,  the  focus  has  moved  from  consumer  protection  (generally guaranteed  by  national  regulations  and  legislation)  to  consumer  information.  Today, standardization  and  competitive  marketing  of  hotel  services  to  foreign  customers  and tourist  professionals  have  emerged  as  driving  forces  for  instituting  a  local  or  national hotel classification system.   Historically, hotel classification systems were developed to ensure  safe  and  reliable  lodging  and  food  for  travelers  at  a  time  when  very  few  such trustworthy  establishments  existed.

The industry  is  so  diverse  and  specialized  that  each  hotel  has  to  have  a  unique  selling proposition to survive in the business and also make a profit. Every hotel tries to establish itself as unique, offering the best services to its guest. The classification of hotels helps tourist select a hotel that meets their requirement.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

The need for the classification of hotel was felt more with the advent of mass tourism. In order  to  provide  travelers  an  idea  of  the  type  of  accommodation  they  offered,  many private clubs, agencies and travel associations came up with descriptions of their lodging properties  in  specified  region.  Gradually  the  governments'  national  and  state  tourism organization and association of industries with stake in the hospitality business, realizing the significance of this, backed the idea and set the standards for various hotel categories. In a nutshell, hotel classification serves the following purpose:

-  Lends uniformity in services and sets general standard of a hotel.
-  Provides  an  idea  regarding  the  range  and  type  of  hotels  available  within  a geographical location.
-  Acts as a measure of control over hotels with respect of  the quality of services offered in each category.

Classification of Hotels: Hotels are classified into several distinct categories to help the prospective  guest  in  identifying  the  right  type  of  hotel  matching  his  standard  and requirements. The hotels may be classified on various bases such as:

-  Size
-  Location
-  Duration of stay
-  Level of services
-  Ownership
-  Star Classification
-  Alternate Accommodation
-  Special hotels

Classification on the Basis of Size: The number of  guest  room  in  a  hotel  is  also  a  basis  of classification of the hotel. Hotels can be grouped into following categories:

1) Small Hotel: In India Hotels with 25 rooms or less  are  classified  as  small  hotels.  E.g.  Hotel Alka,  New  Delhi  and  the  Oberoi  Vanyavilas  , Ranthambore.  Etc.  While  in  the  developed countries lie Europe and America, hotels with less than  100  rooms  are  considered  small  .These hotels provide clean and comfortable environment for the guest to stay.

2) Medium Hotel: Hotel with twenty six to 100 rooms are  called  medium  hotels,  E.g.  Hotel  Taj view  ,Agra  and  chola  Sheraton  Hotel,  Chennai. However  in  developed  nations, In foreign countries (Sorry).In abroad hotel with up to 300 rooms are termed a medium sized hotel.

Chains: When one hotel realizes that they can offer the same services in other cities, chains of the same hotel are  opened  in  those  places.  Hotel  chain  is  an  enterprise  that  administrates,  through  a unique management a number of hotels located in different areas. They can be total or partial  owners  of  the  hotel  and  they  manage  their  administration,  marketing  and promotion.  This  gives  them  the  advantages  of  a  large  central  organisation  providing reservation  systems,  management's  aids,  financial  strength,  expertise,  manpower, specialties,  merchandises and promotional help. Some of the chain companies are Inter Continental Hotel Groups (IHG), Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Accor, Hilton Hotel  Corp.,  Best  Western  International,  and  Resorts,  and  TUI  AG/TUI  Hotels  and Resorts. A chain is usually classified as operating under a management contract or as a franchise or referral group.

The operator can be  a  hotel  chain  with  reputed  name  and  market  image  ,such  as  Hilton  ,Sheraton  ,best western ,choice hospitality, etc.

Franchise: It is the authorization given by a company to another company or individual to sell its unique product /services and use its trademark according to the guidelines given by former, for a specified time, and a specified place. Under it the owner operates as a member of the chain, utilizing the brand image, name, and goodwill and obtaining for a certain fee. Few other terms also needs to be clear here:

Thus management contract as the name suggest is a contract between the owner of the property and management contractor (hotel operator) by which the owner employees the operator as a management to take the full responsibility of operating and managing the hotel. Exampel : Hilton, Sheraton, bestwester, choice hospitality etc

Time -Share Hotels: A  new  concept  of  ownership  also  called  vacation  ownership  or holiday ownership concepts, mushrooming up in resorts areas like hills, beaches, forest. As  the  name  suggest,  it  entails  purchasing  a  tourist  accommodation  at  a  popular destination for a particular time slot in a year which can be week or weeks. Each room or suite is owned by several people who will schedule their visits well in advance with the management office to ensure that the room or suites is available or rent a unit to other vacationers if they cannot avail the facility. It is fully furnished rooms with kitchenettes may have a dining hall with a bar. More desirable the season, the higher the timeshare fee.

It is also required to pay an annual contribution towards the maintenance of apartments and public areas, electricity, gas,  water,  safety,  insurance  etc.  The  owner  can  also  rent  out  the  unit  through management. The most common time share in India is Mahindra and Mahindra, Nanda Tourist Corporation, Sterling Holiday's Resorts,  Avelon Resorts etc.

## Advantage

-  Long-term savings over hotels : The basic timeshare concept is simple: you pay a onetime purchase fee that entitles you to a week every year (or sometimes every other year) at a resort. Instead of renting your vacations, you now own them. Due to the upfront costs, and the fact that the majority of timeshares do not appreciate like normal real estate, the cost savings is in future vacations
-  Home-like accommodations :  Most timeshare units have floor plans that closely resemble  two  bedroom,  two  bathroom  condos  or  apartments,  usually  with  an additional sleeper sofa in the living room. Timeshare unit sizes vary from studios to four bedrooms, allowing plenty of room for families.
-  Real property ownership : If you buy a "deeded" timeshare, you are buying real property. You can give it away, will it to your heirs, rent it, sell it, and so on. Not all timeshares are sold today with deeds.
-  Ability  to  exchange: Exchange  is  consistently  a  top  reason  people  buy  into timeshare.  When  you  own  a  timeshare,  you  have  the  ability  to  exchange  for another resort.
-  Guaranteed vacations :  When  buying  a  timeshare,  you're  making  a  significant upfront investment and may be more motivated to take valuable time with your family annually. If you buy an annual fixed week, you are guaranteed that same week  each  year  at  a  resort  you  are  familiar  with,  and  don't  have  the  hassle  of vacation planning year after year. It is a fact that timeshare owners are more likely to  use  their  vacations  than  those  who  don't  own.  A  lifestyle  decision  to  build memories with your family and friends.
-  Flexibility :  If  unexpected  circumstances  arise,  or  you  simply  cannot  take  your vacation one year, timeshares afford other options. You can bank your timeshare with one of the timeshare exchange companies.
-  Less maintenance than a vacation home :
-  Pay only for the time you use: If you only plan to use a few weeks a year, why keep  an  expensive  vacation  home  vacant  during  the  time  you're  not  there? Timeshare  is  most  frequently  sold  in  one  week  intervals,  but  there  are  more options now.

## Disadvantages

-  Identifying the customer.
-  Designing timeshare according to the customer requirement.
-  Costly Advertising.

Condominium: Condominium  units  also  called  as  Condo  are  purchased  outright  and owned by the guest as second homes. Condominium hotels have single owners instead of multiple  owners  sharing  the  hotel.  In  condominium  hotels,  the  owner  informs  the management company when they would occupy the unit. The management company is free  to  rent  the  unit  for  the  remainder  of  the  year,  and  this  revenue  goes  to  the  owner. Owner purchases a unit and has full right of an unit he has purchased and shares the cost common to  the  complex  such  as  takes,  insurance,  Maintenance,  and  upkeep  of  public areas including swimming, pool, health, clubs, parking, security, air-conditioning, health, cable,  broadband  etc.  Each  owner  can  occupy  or  sell  his  unit  independently  but  is required to follow the rules and regulations laid by the management. In some cases the

management can help the owner in renting out the properties. They take full responsibility of the owner's unit's safety and also pay to the owner a major portion of the rent earned from renting out. Usually the management requests the owner to rent out in case of major conferences. The management earns a major portion by renting out conferences hall and from  catering.  The  Resorts  and  condominium  inns  group  of  Singapore  are  among  the most popular example of such properties.

## SPECIAL HOTELS WORLDWIDE

-  Capsule Hotel
-  Ice Hotel
-  Cave Hotels
-  Tree Houses
-  Green Hotels
- 1. Capsule Hotels : It is a type of hotel originated in Japan which provides small and ‗bed-only' cabinets for its guests. The cabinet size is roughly 2m x 1m x 1.25m and  they  are  mainly  designed  for  local  citizens  who  look  for  cheap accommodations when traveling back to their homes is not an option.
- 2. Ice Hotels : As expressed in its term, ice hotels are mainly built by using snow and ice.

Different from other general hotels, this type of hotel is temporary in its nature which is always torn down and then rebuilt by artists and designers in different seasons. Due to this reason, a guest who chooses to stay in an ice hotel in

Traditionally, these hotels were mostly presented as Eco Lodges because of their location,  often  in  jungles,  and  their  design  inspired  by  the  use  of  traditional building methods applied by skilled local craftsmen in areas, such as Costa Rica and Indonesia

## 1.9 National and International Hotels Groups

Indian  Hotel  Chain: In  India  in  early  period,  hospitality  as  an  industry  was  not organized  but  was  provided  either  on  individual  or  village  bases.  Later  on  Buddhist monasteries provided boarding and lodging to travelers. During Chandra Gupta Maura's Reign, inns and guest houses were established. Then some universities like Taxila also provided accommodation to Buddhist monks and such places were called Chaityas.

In India too the development of hotel industry is closely linked to travel. In India travel was mainly on animals (mule, horse and camel) and for rest during their travel at strategic points  Dharamshalas,  Sarais,  Chaupals  of  Panchayatas,  Chowltry  (in  South  India)  and temples  and  religious  places  were  provided  by  rich  people  such  as  Rajas,  Kings, Zamindars  etc.  Usually  free  accommodation  and  food  for  travelers  was  given.  During medieval period it was mandatory for the state authorities to provide foor and shelter to the  wayside  traveler.  Gradually  there  was  a  set  up  of  hotel  chains  in  India  which  laid more stress on the precise architectural features, organization, standards of their member hotels  but  some  others  focused  on  advertising,  marketing,  purchasing,  human  resource development, etc. The first luxurious hotel by Pallanjee Pestonjee (1840) was started in Bombay.  It  was  famous  for  its  excellent  cuisine,  beersand  wines  and  itys  excellent management.  Later  on  he  opened  another  hotel  at  Fort  in  Bombay.  Few  of  the  hotel chains are discussed below:

## The Tata Group

The  Tata  Group  is  India‗s  best-known  multinational  in  private  sector  with  a  turnover crossing  US$  18  billion  (equivalent  to  3.1%  of  India‗s  GDP).  Long  known  for  its adherence to  business  ethics,  it  is  India‗s  most  respected  private  business  group.  With 250,000  employees  across  105  companies,  it  is  also  India‗s  most  respected  private business group. Tata group was founded by Jamsetji Tata in the l860‗s the Group‗s early years  were  inspired  by  the  spirit  of  nationalism.  In  numerous  occasions  Tata  Group pioneered the way as firsts in Indian industry. To leverage the value of the Tata brand, the thrust  of  the  group‗s  business  has  shifted  from  a  product-driven  to  a  brand  driven portfolio.  The  group‗s  stable  of  brands  and  services  includes  Tata.  Tata  lndica,  Tata Safari, Titan, Tanishq, Taj Hotels, Tata Tea, Tetley, Tata Salt, Westside and VSNL.

JAMSETJI  NUSSERWANJI  TATA  Commencement  of  Taj  Group  of  Hotels: In 1903 there was a significant event in hotel business. The Indian Hotel Company. Mumbai was  incorporated  on  1st  April,  1902  with  an  authorized  capital  of  Rs.  30  lakh.  Mr. Jamsetji Tata opened the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. The idea was born as long ago as 1888, because of a friend‗s disparaging remark that Mumbai could not boast of a single decent hotel. Jamsetji Tata searched the capitals of Europe and bought the best. As far back as 1888, he made sure the Taj would have its own laundry, aerated water-bottling plant,  electroplating  for  its  silverware,  a  Mora  silver  burnishing  machine,  crockery, washing plant and elevators, fellowship and trade and industry and there by to enhance the prosperity of the nation was the objective underlying the project undertaken by him. He knew that the hotel would have to be maintained for years as a losing concern, but the spirit of patriotism and consciousness of duty to the country demanded that he should not count the cost of providing what he regarded as a pre-requisite for the future growth of the  country  and  development  of  her  commerce  as  well  as  cultural  relations  and  cooperation with the advanced countries of the world. Accordingly, foundation was laid in 1988  and  the  construction  of  the  building  completed  in  1903.  Fronting  the  harbor  and commanding  a  magnificent  view,  open  to  sea  breeze  and  valued  service,  the  hotel rendered the country proud as being one of the largest by hotels in the East. It isso well known over the world that nothing more remains to be said about it. According to legend, the architect of the Taj, a Frenchman, spent long hours finalizing his conceptual drawings, then shipped off to France to recuperate. On his return he found the hotel completed in every detail with one small exception: it was located back to front. So the Frenchman did what any artistic soul would do. He did away with his body by shooting himself in the head. The hotel was completed at a cost of Rs. 5, 00,000 in 1904, but he did not live to preside  at  the  opening  ceremony.  In  it‗s  over  100  years  since  then,  the  old  gracious building has accommodated some of the best-known persons in modern history. Fronting the  Mumbai  harbor  and  over-looking  the  Gate  Way  of  India,  it  was  until  recently  the largest hotel in the east. It is rated amongst the top ten hotels in the world by the Fortune Magazine.  India‗s  great  industrialist,  Jamsetji  Tata,  felt  that  it  was  essential  for advancement of Mumbai city in particular and India in general, that it should have an up to-date hotel to provide facilities and comforts to visitors from all parts of the world. Not to  make  a  profitable  investment,  but  to  attract  visitors  from  overseas  with  a  view  to promoting.

## Hilton Hotels Corporation

Hilton  Worldwide  (formerly, Hilton  Hotels  Corporation )  is  a  global  hospitality company. It is owned by the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm. As of January 2009 Hilton  brands  encompass  3,200  hotels  with  545,000  rooms  in  77  countries.  Hilton  is ranked as the 43rd largest private company in the United States by Forbes.The company owns, manages or franchises a portfolio of  brands,  including  Hilton  Hotels  &  Resorts, Conrad Hotels, Doubletree, Embassy Suites Hotels, Hampton Inn, Hampton Inn & Suites, Hilton  Garden  Inn,  Hilton  Grand  Vacations  Company,  Homewood  Suites  by  Hilton, Home2 Suites by Hilton and The Waldorf-Astoria Collection. It was founded by Conrad Hilton  in  Cisco,  Texas  and  was  headquartered  in  Beverly  Hills,  California  from  1969 until  2009.  The  company  moved  to  Tysons  Corner,  unincorporated  Fairfax  County, Virginia, near McLean in August 2009.

HISTORY: Conrad  Hilton  founded  the  original  company  in  1919  with  one  hotel  in Cisco, Texas. The Hotels name is Mobley Hotel. The company separated its international operations  into  a  separate  traded  company  on  December  1,  1964,  known  as  Hilton International  Co.  In  1967  Trans  World  Corp.,  the  holding  company  for  Trans  World Airlines, acquired the separated company. In 1986 it was sold to UAL Corp., the holding company  for  United  Airlines,  who  became  Allegis  Corp.  in  an  attempt  to  re-incarnate itself as a full service travel company encompassing Westin Hotels and Hertz rental cars in addition to Hilton International and United Airlines. In 1987 after a corporate putsch, the renamed UAL Corp. sold Hilton International to Ladbroke Group plc, a British leisure and gambling company, which in May 1999 adopted the name Hilton Group plc. As a result, there were two separate, fully independent companies operating hotels under the Hilton name. Those Hilton Hotels outside the US were, until recently, styled as Hilton International hotels. In addition, for many years hotels run by the Hilton Group in the US were  called  Vista  International  Hotels,  while  hotels  operated  by  the  American  arm  of Hilton outside the US were named Conrad Hotels. The Vista chain has been phased out, while  Conrad  is  now  restyled  as  one  of  the  luxury  brands  of  Hilton  (along  with  The Waldorf-Astoria  Collection)  and  operates  hotels  within  the  US,  as  well  as  abroad.  To minimize  consumer  confusion,  the  American  and  British  Hilton  companies,  from  the 1990s onwards, had a joint marketing agreement under which they shared the same logos, promoted each others' brands and maintained joint reservation systems.

In 1971, Hilton acquired International Leisure Company, including the Las Vegas Hilton and Flamingo Hilton. On December 29, 2005, Hilton Hotels Corporation agreed to reacquire the Hilton International chain from its British owner, Hilton Group plc, for GBP 3.3 billion (or $5.71 billion). As well as bringing the two Hilton companies back together as a single entity, this deal also included Hilton plc properties operating as Conrad Hotels, Scandic Hotels  and  Living  Well  Health  Clubs. On  February  23,  2006,  the  deal  closed, making Hilton Hotels the world's fifth largest hotel operator in number of rooms. Hilton Group PLC (headquartered in the UK) then renamed itself  Ladbrokes plc.  In  February 2009, Hilton Hotels Corp., announced that its headquarters were moving from its three buildings  on  Civic  Center  Drive  in  Beverly  Hills  to  Fairfax  County,  Virginia,  located between  Washington,  D.C.  and  Dulles  International  Airport.  Just  across  the  Potomac River  is  Montgomery  County,  Maryland,  home  to  a  number  of  Hilton's  competitors including Marriott International, Ritz-Carlton, Host Hotels & Resorts, and Choice Hotels, and  was  also  considered  for  the  relocation  along  with  Washington.  The  move  was expected following to the 2007 acquisition, in order for the headquarters to be nearer to The Blackstone Group's New York headquarters.

HISTORY: In  the  1960s,  the  travel  industry  in  France  was  booming,  but  many  new hotels  were  concentrated  only  in  major  urban  areas  such  as  Paris.  At  the  time,  Paul Dubrule and Gérard Pélisson were both living in the United States,  working for  major computer  firms.  They  went  into  business  together,  and  in  1967,  founded  the  SIEH (Société d'investissement et d'exploitation hôteliers) hotel group. Having seen the success of  American  lodging  properties  in  suburban  areas  and  along  major  highways,  Dubrule and Pélisson opened their first American-style Novotel hotel outside of Lille in northern France. In 1974, they launched the Ibis brand with the opening of the Ibis Bordeaux.

This  is  different  from  Holiday  Inn  which  from  their  early  beginnings implemented  numerous  mandatory  standards  and  guidelines  (e.g.  room  size  and amenities)  at  every  one  of  their  locations.  Also,  Quality  Inn  accepted  franchisees  with existing hotels. During its early years, Quality Courts' operations were entirely in areas of the  U.S.  east  of  the  Mississippi  River  and  portions  of  Canada.  From  1946  to  1964, Quality had a marketing partnership with Best Western, whose properties were located mostly  west  of  the  Mississippi  River,  and  thus  not  in  direct  competition  with  Quality. While this partnership made sense geographically, it did not work well in the long run, and was abandoned in 1964 as Best Western expanded into the Eastern U.S. with its Best Eastern operation (which was replaced by a nationwide Best Western operation in 1967). Quality Courts began its efforts toward national coverage in 1966 when it opened a motel in St. Louis, Missouri and two in Texas at Houston and Arlington.

The  company  became  Quality  International  as  the  company  switched  to  franchising  in 1972.  A  few  years  later,  the  franchising  well  on  its  way,  about  300  hotels  were independently owned and only about 38 were still company-owned. In 1982, Quality Inns pioneered segmentation in the lodging industry by introducing Comfort Inns and Quality

Royale. Comfort Inn competes with such chains such as America Inn Hotels, Baymont Inn & Suites, and Fairfield Inn by Marriott; Quality Royale was meant to compete with upper  mid-priced  chains  like  Red  Lion  and  Four  Points  by  Sheraton.  Comfort  Inn experienced impressivegrowth in the 1980s and 1990s. Quality Royale was converted to Clarion Hotels in 1987. It represented a line of full-service hotels that offer travelers a variety  of  hotel  styles  and  locations,  from  city  centers,  airport,  and  resorts.  Clarion provides  a  full  spectrum  of  services  -  including  full  service  restaurants,  lounges,  room service, and banquet and conference centers. Clarion's boutique line, Clarion Collection (now Ascend Collection), is an extension of the brand. Ascend Collection is designed for high-end,  boutique  and  historic  hotels  that  have  an  established  local  identity.  Clarions compete  with  hotel  chains  like  Red  Lion,  Radisson,  and  Four  Points  by  Sheraton. Internationally, over 300 Clarion Hotels are open with several more under development. In  1989,  the  company  introduced  Sleep  Inn,  an  economy  brand  utilizing  a  consistent interior corridor design prototype and all-new construction, designed by Rob Spurr. Sleep Inn  and  Sleep  Inn  and  Suites  are  lower  mid-priced  and  can  be  compared  to  Marriott's Fairfield  Inn,  Wyndham's  Microtel,  Hilton's  Hampton  Inn,  or  I.H.G's  Holiday  Inn Express. The first location opened in the United Kingdom in 1989. Since then, over 320 locations are open. All offer a "Morning Medley" deluxe continental breakfast, swimming pools  at  most  locations,  free  local  calls,  and  a  consistent  exterior/interior  design.  The brand  is  receiving  its  first  major  facelift  in  history  with  its  "Brand  Refresh".  This  is essentially  a  modernization  of  all  properties  by  2012  with  new  boutique-inspired  guest rooms and public spaces.

In 1992 Choice Hotels became the largest franchise hotel chain in the world. In  January  2005  Choice  Hotels  introduced  a  new  upscale,  all-suite  hotel  designed  in contemporary  style  called  Cambria  Suites.  The  first  Cambria  Suites  opened  in  Boise, Idaho  on  April  17,  2007.  Approximately  20  Cambria  Suites  hotels  are  planned,  with locations such as Bloomington, Minnesota and Savannah, Georgia scheduled to open in 2007.  In  September  2005  Choice  Hotels  acquired  the  Suburban  Extended-Stay  Hotel chain,  which  consists  of  67  extended  stay  hotels.  In  2008  the  company  introduced  the Ascend Collection (formerly Clarion Collection), an elite upscale membership collection of historic, boutique and unique hotels.

## Best Western

Best Western International, Inc. is the world's largest hotel chain, with over 4,000 hotels in  nearly  80  countries.  The  chain,  with  its  corporate  headquarters  in  Phoenix,  Arizona, operates more than 2,000 hotels in North America alone. Best Western has a marketing program involving placement of free Wi-Fi access hotspots in its hotels. Since 2002, Best Western International has begun creatingan upscale brand for some properties located in Europe and Asia: Best Western Premier. Unlike other chains, which are often a mix of company-owned and franchised units, each Best Western hotel is an independently owned and  operated  franchise.  Best  Western  does  not  offer  franchises  in  the  traditional  sense (where  both  franchisee  and  franchisor  are  operating  for-profit),  however.  Instead,  Best Western operates as a nonprofit membership association, with each franchisee acting and voting as a member of the association.

History: Best  Western  began  in  the  years  following  World  War  II.  At  the  time,  most hotels  were  either  large  urban  properties,  or  smaller  family  owned  roadside  hotels.  In

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

California, a network of independent hotel operators began making referrals of each other to  travelers.  This  small  and  informal  network  eventually  grew  into  the  modern  Best Western hotel chain founded by M.K. Guertin in 1946.

The name "Best Western" was a result of most of their properties originally being located in  the  Western  part  of  the  United  States  west  of  the  Mississippi  River.  From  1946  to 1964, Best Western had a marketing partnership with Quality Courts, the forerunner of the chain known today as Quality Inns, whose properties were located mostly east of the Mississippi  River,  and  thus  not  in  direct  competition  with  Best  Western.  While  this partnership made sense geographically, it did not go over well in the long run, and was abandoned. In 1964, Best Western launched an expansion effort of its own operations east of the Mississippi by using the moniker "Best Eastern" for those properties with the same typestyle and Gold Crown logo as "Best Western." By 1967, the "Best Eastern" name was dropped  and  all  motels  from  coast-to-coast  got  the  "Best  Western"  name  and  Gold Crown, a move that would further enhance an already successful marketing brand into the "World's  Largest  Hotel  Chain"  by  the  1970s.  Best  Western's  "Gold  Crown"  logo  was introduced in 1964 and would continue with a few minor revisions over the next 30 years until it was replaced by the current blue and yellow logo in 1994.

Best Western Australia and New Zealand: In 1981, Homestead Motor Inns of Australia affiliated with Best Western. This move put 'International' after the Best Western name. The company has been known as Best Western International ever since. In early 2007, Best Western Australasia took over the rights to operate Best Western properties in New Zealand from the previous company, the Motel Federation of New Zealand. This was a bold but beneficial move for the brand as it made way for better quality properties to be brought  into  the  brand.  Currently,  Best  Western  Australasia  has  205  properties  in  the group (11 in New Zealand and 194 in Australia).

## Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide

Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. is a hospitality ownership and management organization, headquartered in White Plains, New York. One of the world's largest hotel companies,  it  owns,  operates,  franchises  and  manages  hotels,  resorts,  spas,  residences, and  vacation  ownership  properties  under  its  nine  owned  brands.  As  of  December  31, 2008, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc . owned, managed, or franchised 942 properties employing over 145,000 people, of whom approximately 36% were employed in the United States.

HISTORY: Starwood  Hotels  and  Resorts  were  originally  formed  by  the  real  estate investment  firm  Starwood  Capital  to  take  advantage  of  a  tax  break;  at  the  time  the company was known as Starwood Lodging. Initially, Starwood Lodging owned a number of hotels throughout North America, all under different brand names. The Westin Hotel Company was purchased in 1994 from Aoki Corporation of Japan. Starwood acquired the Sheraton, Four Points by Sheraton, and The Luxury Collection brands from ITT Sheraton in 1998.

In  1999,  Starwood  launched  their  "W"  Hotels  brand.  In  September  2005,  Starwood announced the launch of aloft, a new hotel brand based on W. aloft Hotels catered toward business travelers. Starwood intends to have 500 aloft hotels worldwide by 2012. In 2005,

Starwood  purchased  the  Le  Méridien  brand,  which  greatly  increased  the  company's operations in Europe.

Westin: The Westin Hotels and Resorts brand is Starwood's largest upscale hotels and resorts  brand,  and  it  is  the  oldest  brand  within  Starwood.  Apart  from  its  stylized  font, Westin's official logo is seldom used. It is either red or black, which usually depends on what the respective text color of "Westin" is. Four Points by Sheraton: Four Points by Sheraton  was  launched  in  1995  as  a  mid-scale  hotel  brand.  Originally  the  brand  was created  by  re-naming  existing  Sheraton  "Inns"  (a  smaller,  limited  service  version  of Sheraton Hotels). The new name avoided the confusion some guests found in having two hotel categories (full service and mid-scale) with the same name (Sheraton).

W Hotels: W Hotels is Starwood's luxury boutique hotel brand. The hotel brand, which generally markets towards a younger crowd, was launched in 1998 with its first property, W  New  York,  at  541  Lexington  Avenue  in  Manhattan.  The  brand  has  expanded internationally  with  properties  opening  first  in  Mexico  City,  Seoul,  and  Istanbul.  The brand's first resort property is W Maldives Retreat & Spa.

The W Barcelona hotel was the W's first in Western Europe and opened in October 2009. It features a futuristic design by architect Ricardo Bofill in the shape of a sail. Standing 26 stories tall, it can be seen from all over the city. The property is located next to the beach and boasts private access to it.  It  also  includes  a  Bliss  spa,  gym  and  conference facilities.

## Carlson Hotels

Carlson (often referred to by its previous name Carlson Companies ) is a privately held international corporation in the hotel, restaurant, and travel industries. Headquartered in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States, Carlson brands and services, including franchised operations, employ about 150,000 people in more than 150 countries and  territories.  The  company's  2008  sales,  including  those  from  franchised  operations, totaled $38 billion. It is one of the largest family-held corporations in the country.

History: Carlson  was  founded  in  1938  as  the  Gold  Bond  Stamp  Company  by  Curt Carlson, who used a $55 loan to start his venture. Founded during the Great Depression, Mr.  Carlson  used  "Gold  Bond  Stamps",  a  consumer  loyalty  program  based  on  trading stamps, to provided consumer incentive for grocery stores.

Revenue from this business was brisk until the late 1960s, at which time trading stamps began to lose popularity and the company was renamed "Carlson Companies" in 1973 as it diversified into various hospitality and travel industries. In 1962, Carlson purchased its first Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis. It then went on to purchase T.G.I. Friday's in 1975 and  Country  Kitchen  International  in  1977,  in  1987  it  purchased  Comfort  Suites,  and started Country Inns & Suites by Carlson. Carlson's economy brand, Park Inn/Suites, was launched in 1986, and a new upscale brand, Park Plaza, in 1988. In a return to its roots, the  Carlson  Companies  started  an  electronic  consumer  incentive  program  named  Gold Points.com in 1996. The program later was modified and became gold points plus, the incentive program of Carlson Hotels. Curt Carlson died in 1999, and the position of CEO was  soon  taken  up  by  his  daughter,  Marilyn  Carlson  Nelson.  Hubert  Joly  became Carlson's president and chief executive officer in 2008, and Nelson continues to serve as chairman  of  the  board.  Carlson's  hotel  business  is  one  of  the  world's  leading,  most

innovative, hotel companies with more than 1,075 locations in 77 countries and a vibrant portfolio of great brands including Radisson, Country Inns and Suites By Carlson, Park Inn and Park Plaza. Carlson's success in the hotel space is deeply rooted in our Carlson Credo and our entrepreneurial spirit.  We  have  seen  significant  global  growth  in  recent years and we have the necessary momentum, strategies, quality, brands and resources to accelerate this expansion: we plan to increase our number of hotels by at least 50 percent in  the  next  five  years  and  to  establish  all  our  brands  as  the  leaders  of  their  segments. Carlson has a great history as a hotel industry leader.

## Hyatt Corporation

Hyatt Corporation is one of the leading hotel companies in North America. Owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago, Hyatt manages or licenses the management of 87 hotels and 16 resorts (with a total of 55,000 rooms) in 83 cities in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean.  In  addition  to  its  resorts,  Hyatt  has  also  developed  other  special  hotel concepts--the Grand Hyatt, the Park Hyatt, and Classic Residence by Hyatt. Grand Hyatts are  large-scale,  higher  priced  hotels  located  in  culturally  rich  cities,  with  three  in  the United  States  (New  York,  San  Francisco,  and  Washington,  D.C.).  Park  Hyatts  are modeled  after  small  European  hotels  and  are  located  in  Chicago,  Los  Angeles,  San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. The Classic Residence by Hyatt properties offers luxury retirement apartments for rental. Starting in the mid-1990s, the company has also sought growth opportunities in franchising, time-share properties, free-standing golf courses, and casinos.

The Founding Family: While Hyatt's history as a corporate entity dates from 1957, the Pritzker family, who built and controls Hyatt, has been active significantly longer. In the late  19th  century,  the  Pritzkers  immigrated  to  the  United  States  from  the  Ukraine. Patriarch  Nicholas  Pritzker  led  them  to  Chicago,  and  in  1902  he  founded  Pritzker  & Pritzker  (P&P),  the  law  firm  that  was  to  evolve  into  a  management  company  and  the center of the Pritzkers' many and varied investments. P&P grew, and by the late 1920s it had become a respected local firm. At that time, the Pritzkers' best client was Goldblatt Brothers, the low-priced Chicago department store chain. Through the Goldblatts, Abram (A.N.) Pritzker, Nicholas Pritzker's son, met Walter M. Heymann, then a leading Chicago commercial banker and an officer at the First National Bank of Chicago. In succeeding years A.N. Pritzker and Walter Heymann became business associates, and the powerful First National Bank of Chicago became the financial cornerstone of the Pritzker family empire.

Hyatt Emerges in the 1950s: The story of Hyatt Corporation begins with the succeeding generation of Pritzkers. By the early 1950s, Pritzker's oldest son, Jay, had become active in the family business. Something of a prodigy, Jay Pritzker had graduated high school at 14.  He  finished  college  soon  thereafter  and  then  took  a  law  degree  from  Northwestern University. During World War II he worked first as a flight instructor and later for the U.S. government agency that managed German-owned companies. In that position, he sat on corporate boards with men many years his senior. An accomplished deal-maker even in his earliest years, Jay would later become well known for his quickness at sizing up balance  sheets  and  offering  deals.  Jay,  beginning  in  1957,  made  the  initial  deals  that formed the basis for Hyatt. Jay's youngest brother, Donald Pritzker, finished law school in

1959, whereupon he joined P&P. Meanwhile, the middle brother, Robert Pritzker, earned an  industrial  engineering  degree  at  the  Illinois  Institute  of  Technology  in  Chicago  and later he and Jay would found and manage the Marmon Group.

In 1957 Jay Pritzker bought a small Los Angeles International Airport motel named Hyatt House  after  its  original  owner,  Hyatt  von  Dehn.  Within  four  years,  Jay  expanded  the single  property  into  a  chain  of  six  hotels  and  brought  Donald  Pritzker  to  California  as manager  of  operations,  reporting  to  Jay.  The  two  made  a  good  team,  with  Jay's  dealmaking  skills  and  Donald's  managerial  ability  and  gregarious  personality.  Hyatt  grew rapidly  during  its  first  decade,  opening  small  motor  inns  on  the  West  Coast  and  one outside  Chicago.  The  fledgling  company  went  public  in  1967,  but  the  more  important event of that watershed year was the opening in Atlanta of its first hotel with an atrium tower  lobby,  designed  by  the  architect  John  Portman.  The  Portman  atrium  was  a  21storey interior courtyard, designed so that each hotel room entered off the high-rise open space, set off with a central glass elevator leading to all floors, and hanging green vines growing  from  each  floor's  balcony.  The  overall  effect  was  revolutionary,  because  the Portman interior eliminated the impersonal hallway with rows of doors and brought to the hotel  interior  an  open-air  congeniality,  with  the  spin-off  of  greater  safety,  feeling  of security, and warmth. The Portman lobby became the hotel's signature and brought Hyatt to widespread notice for the first time, as well as advancing the concept of public space in buildings.

What became the Hyatt Regency Atlanta was part of the 15-building Peachtree Center. The developers of the large hotel property were in financial trouble and both Hilton and Marriott passed up opportunities to purchase the property before Hyatt did and finished construction. Soon after the hotel opened, its occupancy rate reached 94.6 percent. Hyatt grew to a chain of 13 hotels by 1969. That year, the Pritzkers set up a separate company called Hyatt International Corporation to expand the chain overseas, with its first hotel the Hyatt Regency Hong Kong. In 1972, Donald died of a heart attack at the age of 39. Jay installed his brother-in-law, Hugh M. "Skip" Friend, Jr., as the new president.

Growth in the 1970s: The company grew rapidly during the 1970s aided by the signature Hyatt design and the innovations that a young staff was able to devise. Management went wrong,  however,  when  it  was  discovered  in  1977  that  Friend  had  spent  $300,000  of company money on personal expenses.

The  1980s: In  1980,  Thomas  Jay  Pritzker,  Jay's  son,  became  president,  with  Jay remaining chairman and CEO. The decade started promisingly with three significant firsts in  1980: the openings of the first Park Hyatt, the first Grand Hyatt, and the first Hyatt resort.  Park  Hyatts  were  designed  as  smaller  luxury  hotels  with  a  European  style, featuring  personalized  service,  privacy,  and  elegance;  the  first  one  opened  in  Chicago near the Water Tower. Grand Hyatts were designed for the high-end market in culturally rich  destinations,  and  featured  sophisticated  leisure,  banquet,  and  conference  facilities utilizing the latest technology. Hyatt Resorts werespecially designed to reflect the local area  of  location  and  offered  numerous  activities  and  facilities  for  their  guests;  the  first Hyatt resort was the Hyatt Regency Maui in Hawaii.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

Then in 1981, two skywalks at the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 229 in what the National Bureau of Standards called the most devastating structural collapse ever to take place in the United States. Between 1981 and 1986, more than 2,000 resulting lawsuits were settled for a total of $120 million. In June 1986, 900 individuals remaining in a federal class action suit against the hotel settled all claims for $1,000 each. Ultimately, "gross negligence and misconduct" were attributed to engineers Daniel Duncan, Jack Gillum, and their former company, G.C.E. International Inc., whose "hurry-up" design system caused them to be pouring concrete on one part of the building while finishing the design on the rest of the building. As was the case with most Hyatt hotels at this time, Hyatt was managing the hotel for its owner and builder, Hallmark Properties, so Hyatt was not held liable. Still it did not help to have the Hyatt name associated with such a disaster. During the decade, Hyatt Corporation also became involved in an indirect way in some of the Pritzkers' nonlodging activities. Most notable was the 1983 purchase of the troubled Braniff airline through Dalfort, a Hyatt subsidiary. Under Dalfort, and with Jay Pritzker taking the lead, Braniff's losses were cut. But after a proposed merger with the also troubled Pan Am Corp. failed in 1987, Braniff was sold the following year.

Also  in  1989,  Hyatt  introduced  the  Camp  Hyatt  program  to  attempt  to  attract  more families  to  its  somewhat  business-oriented  facilities.  Under  the  program,  Hyatt  hotels began to offer numerous activities geared toward the toddler to preteen set, gave parents the option of taking a half-priced second room for their kids, and added menus and room service tailored for children.

1990s and Beyond: As the 1990s began, Hyatt's growth was somewhat  challenged by what analysts regarded as the reluctance of some owners of new hotels to hire Hyatt as managers, given the relatively high cost of running a glitzy Hyatt hotel. In fact, Hyatt was beginning to run the risk of losing existing contracts. Seeking to streamline operations, the company laid off more than 1,000 of its work force and then embarked on a detailed appraisal  of  the  services  it  was  offering  at  its  hotels.  By  1994,  Hyatt's  gross  operating profits  had  increased  45  percent  from  1990  and  the  company  was  hearing  fewer complaints  from  hotel  owners  about  costs.  Starting  in  1994,  the  company  moved cautiously into franchising for the first time. The first two franchised Hyatts were older hotels--the Hyatt Sainte Claire in downtown San Jose and the Hyatt Regency Pier Sixty Six in Fort Lauderdale. Scheduled to open in 1997 was a third franchised Hyatt, the Hyatt Regency  Wichita,  and  a  new  downtown  convention  hotel.  Hyatt  also  entered,  again cautiously, the crowded time-share property market with the opening in June 1995 of a resort known as Hyatt's Sunset Harbor Key West. Hyatt was reportedly also looking for a site  to  move  into the lucrative  Las  Vegas  gambling mecca.  In addition to its pursuit of these growth opportunities, Hyatt also strived through innovation to retain its role at the forefront  of  the  industry.  In  1994  the  company  tested  automated  check-in  kiosks  in  a number of its hotels. The kiosks, which allowed guests to check themselves in less than one  minute  and  even  dispensed  room  keys,  proved  a  success  and  were  subsequently expanded to other Hyatts. The company also successfully introduced a telephone check-in system.

## 2.4 Room Tariff

Tariff: the  term  tariff  means rate  and when applied  to rooms of the  hotel  it becomes room rates/ room tariff  which are available in the published form  with the hotel known as the tariff card. Hotels display their room rent on tariff card, which provide information about the room rate for different types of rooms available in the hotel. As price is one of the  major  elements  involved  in  the  marketing  and  positioning  of  a  product  or  service therefore the room tariff of a hotel must generate the optimum revenue for the hotel and give the profit to the owner's besides covering the other cost involved in the production. Hotel room rates fixation is a difficult task.

Factors for deciding a room tariff: Various factors which should be kept in the mind while deciding the room tariff for the hotel are:

Cost: The total expenditure that is required in providing services and products to the ultimate consumer of the hotel services is the cost. The total cost can include fixed cost, labour cost and material cost. Tariff should be fixed in such a manner

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

that it covers the cost of it production and the profit. Higher the cost of the room, the higher will be the room rent.

Level/ Standard of Service: Level or standard of services provided by the hotel is  also  one  of  the  factor  for  deciding  the  room  tariff  .  A  hotel  offering  the  best services like spa, gymnasium, banquet halls, specialty restaurants, etc, will charge a higher room rent in comparison to other hotels offering limited services. Even more  the  amenities,  higher  the  standards  and  higher  the  room  rent.  the  star classification of the hotel is also based on level of services, five star or above will have  better  standards  of  services  so  higher  room  rent  as  compared  to  those  of others.

Competition: Rates  should  be  competitive  with  other  hotels  of  the  same standards  and  providing  the  same  services  and  facilities  in  similar  locations  of city.  Competition  in  the  market  plays  an  important  role  in  determining  the  rack rate of the hotel. The higher the competition, the lower will be the room rent.

Customer profile: The category of customer coming to your hotel must also be considered .The social status and financial status i.e. paying capacity, of the guest should be kept in mind.

Room location: The location of the room also affects the room tariff. front rooms or rooms with better and beautiful view would cost higher than other rooms.

Locality: The locality or the area in which hotel is situated also gain importance while fixing the room tariff. As if the hotel is situated in posh locality where all the shopping and other facilities are available and are also approachable to railway or airport will have higher room rates as compared to those located in backward and far off localities.

Publicity: The  amount  of  publicity  done  by  the  hotel  and  special  budget prescribed for hotel publicity also affects in deciding the room rates this type of expanse also need to be adjusted in the room rent as there is no source of return for such expenditure but they helps in increasing the occupancy of the hotel

## ROOM TARIFF FIXATION

Bases of charging room rent: Once the room tariff has been decided, every hotel has to decide  the  base  for  charging  the  room  rent  i.e.  they  have  to  decide  the  criteria  for establishing the end of the day to post the room charges into the guest account. The end of the day is the arbitrary time which is believed to be the end of the financial transactions for a particular day. As hotel works for 24x7x365 it is essential to fix a time which will be treated as the end of the day and beginning of the new day.

Fixed Check-in/checkout Time : Most hotels follow the fixed check-in/checkout system for fixation of tariff in hotel. As per this system, a particular time of the day is fixed as the check-out time or is marked as the end of the day. Generally, it is 12 noon. According to this, the day starts at 12 noon daily and ends at 12 noon the next day, regardless of the

time at which the guest checks-in. The major advantage of this system of charging the room rent is  that  the  same  room  can  be  sold  more  than  once  in  a  day.  This  system  is normally adopted by commercial hotels. Most of the hotels following this system may allow relaxation of a few hours before and after check-out time in charging the room rent. Since it is not practical for any guest to check in at exactly 1200 hrs, most hotels permit a grace  period  (of  about  2  hours),  before  and  after  checkout  time.  Though  the  system  is good for the hotelier, many guests may think of this system as unreasonable. To ensure renewed patronage by the guests, many hotels today tell a guest that there exists a two hour grace period for check-in or check-out, but actually give a leeway of three hours to avoid disputes. Also, for an early morning check-in after 0600 hrs, instead of a full day extra  to  be  charged,  most  hotels  charge  only  a  half  day's  charges.  Following  the  same systems, when a guest checks-out as late as 1800 hrs, a half day tariff is again charged instead of a full day's charge. The logic that is explained in this system is that the room cannot be sold after that point of the day. For an early morning check-in, the guest could be  told  that  the  room  could  not  have  been  sold  the  previous  night.  However,  the  least amount charged is a minimum of one day's charge.

## Example 1

Mr. A. checks-in on Sunday at 1200 hrs to room # 101.

Mr. A checks-out on Monday at 0030 hrs from room # 101.

Mr. B. checks-in on Monday at 0200 hrs to room # 101 and checks-out at 1200 hrs on Monday.

Mr. A. And Mr. B will both will be charged for one day each.

## Example 2

Mr. X checks - in at 0500 hrs on Monday.

Mr. X checks-out at 0600 hrs on Tuesday.

Mr. X will be charged for two days as per this system.

Twenty-four Hours Basis System : In this system of charging the room rent, there is no fixed  check-in/  checkout  time.  A  room  is  assigned  to  the  guest  for  twenty-  four  hours from the time of his arrival ie As per this system, the guest is entitled to keep his room for a period of 24 hours from the point of the his check-in, for a day's charge and there is no fixed time of arrival for the guest This system is followed in transit hotels and hotels that are located in the vicinity of railway stations, where guests normally stay for few hours. In this system, no relaxation of time is given after the completion of twenty-four hours of stay.

Example 1: Mr. X checks-in at 01:00 pm on Tuesday. He will be charged for one day till 01:00 pm on Wednesday.

Example 2: Mr. Y checks in at 11:00 am of 15th March would be charged for one day till 11:00 am of 16th March

Number  of  Nights: This  system  of  charging  the  room  rent  is  a  modification  of  the twenty-four  hour  system.  Here,  According  to  this  system,  the  guest  is  charged  on  the basis of the number of nights he stays in the hotel room. If a guest does not stay at night, a half day rent is charged from him. Very much connected to this system of charging is the concept of Day Rate or ‗Day Use Rate'. This is a concessional rate given to guests who do not stay over-night in the hotel. Usually this is targeted at business clientele who use

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

the room from 0900 hrs to 1800 hrs. The guest may check-in to the hotel for a wash and change in the morning, leave his baggage in the room and carry on for his business. He may return in the evening, have a wash and change, check-out and take the evening flight out. This system is now outdated and not so popular.

Example 1: Mr. A checks-in at 11:00 am on Tuesday and checks out at 02:00 pm on the same day  and Mr. G checks in at 05:00pm on Tuesday and checks out at 10:00pmon Tuesday .Both would have paid for only half day's rent thus hotel will only earn a total of day's room rent  from both of them.

Room tariff Fixation: Fixation of room tariff is a difficult task for the management. As if room rents are low, the hotel operations will not be economical and if they are too high guest  may  not  patronize  the  property.  Hence  an  accurate  and  competitive  room  rent  is very  much  essential  for  running  a  successful  hospitality  business.  A  hotel  fixes  room tariff on the following basis:

-  Cost Based Pricing: (For details refer Unit 5, refer 5.3.1 )
-  Market Based Pricing: (For details refer Unit 5, refer 5.3.1)
-  On the basis of competitor's rate:
-  Inclusive and non-inclusive rates/on the basis of meal plans

On the basis of competitor's rate: The hotels fix their room tariff on the basis of what their  competitor's in their neighborhood are charging. It is the most unrealistic method and  does  not  include  any  consideration  of  the  features  and  facilities  of  the  own organization and guest may sometimes feel cheated if the hotel is not able to give them value for money.

Inclusive and non-inclusive rates/on the basis of meal plans: Hotels also charge room rates  on  the  basis  of  meals  provided or  not  provided along  with the room to the guest. Meal plans include: European plan, Modified American plan, American plan, Continental plan

## TYPES OF ROOM RATES

Hotel offer two types of room rates- Rack Rate it is the standard rate of the room and the discounted rated which gives discount on the rack rate on the basis of the business offered by the clientele. Room rates are of two types:

-  Rack Rate
-  Discounted Rate

Rack Rate: It is a term which refers to the actual or normal room rate of the hotel room. Hotel generally fixes a standard rate for each of the category of rooms offered to guests. Traditionally, a wooden rack or rate board was placed near the room rack in the lobby or at the reception, hence the name is placed rack rate. This is the rate which is published on the  tariff  card  of  the  hotel  and  is  without  any  discount  is  known  as  the  Rack  rate.  In common parlance, rack rate may be termed as the MRP of a hotel room.

Discounted Rate: To attract the guest, increase the business and to compete in the market hotels offer different types of discounted room tariff. Discounted tariff is always lower

than the rack rate. Sometimes hotels offer discounts to guest to please him for a courtesy as it is expected that the guest may be sending lot of business to the hotel in future.

## BRIEF ABOUT EQUIPMENT USED IN FRONT OFFICE

Room Rack :  This  rack is found in non-automated and semi-automated hotels. A room rack is an array of metal file pockets designed to hold room rack slips bearing the name of the  guest,  date  and  time  of  arrival,  number  of  rooms,  room  type  and  rate,  date  of departure, other minor details like - reserved by, billing instructions, special instructions, which is used to indicate room status. In some hotels, a slip or the registration card itself can be inserted in the rack. Various color codes are also used to indicate the room status information  (occupied,  out  of  order,  vacant  and  so  on).  These  racks  cannot  be  moved easily and can be reused. Reservations can be kept in accordance with the date of arrival order. Room rack is eliminated in a fully automated system.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

Key Rack : Key rack has sockets to store guestroom keys. They are also called as pigeon hole.  Presently,  with  the  development  in  technology,  we  have  electronic  key  system which can be generated through one console itself and does not require any storage; the extra  space  needed  for  the  keys  is  eliminated.  Those  hotels  which  still  depend  on  key slots; they utilize their space by combining it with mail, and message rack.

Mail, and Message Rack :  Even if the mail, and message rack is separated from the key rack, accessibility factor for the person who is responsible for the same is a must. For the mails and messages in a fully automated hotel, it can be retrieved from the room, house phone as the message can be stored through the voice mail system. Even for the delivery of mail, the message for the same can be passed through the electronic message center. The guest gets to know about it through a message light in the room.

Reservation Rack :  In a non-automated hotel this rack plays a pivotal role. In this rack, the  guest  information  is  placed  as  per  the  date  of  arrival  and  also  subdivided  in alphabetical  order.  This  system  of  order  is  important  so  as  to  have  a  quick  look  at  the availability  of  the  rooms  for  further  bookings.  In  a  fully  automated  hotel,  this  rack  is eliminated, as the property management system takes over it.

Information Rack: This rack is used to help the employees to route the mail, messages and other visitor inquiries in a systematic way. To smoothen the functioning, the rack has two listing - one in alphabetical order and other one by room numbers. Again this rack is not required in a fully automated hotel.

Folio Bucket: This tray is kept usually in the non-automated hotel and semi-automated hotel as well, which is kept in ascending order of the room numbers. The placement of folio bucket should be such a way that it can be accessed by both the front office assistant and the cashier, for the updating/posting of transactions of the guest staying in the hotel and  final  billing.  For  the  departed  guest,  who  pays  the  bill  through  credit  card  or  by company account, there is one more folio tray in the accounts department. This folio is closed only after the final payment (when the balance shows zero amount) or if not paid and is declared as bad debt.

Posting Machines :  Semi- automated hotels use posting machines. This machine records transactions, makes account statement, also analyses sales activity and does an audit trail of charge purchase transactions. The advantage here is printed copy of the guest's folio. But the disadvantage and being the major one is that it is prone to errors as it requires a person to update charge manually and difficult to operate. Fully automated do not require posting machines as hotels PMS can do all the work with greater advantages over posting machines.

Voucher  Rack: Once  the  transaction  is  over,  the  vouchers  are  required  for  the  audit process by the accounts department for verification, hence the need of the voucher rack. Ideally  this  should  be  situated  near  the  posting  machine  where  the  cashier  or  the  front desk assistant can access it easily.

Call Accounting System: Call  Accounting System is a software program that helps in processing of calls (outgoing or incoming), pricing them and billing accordingly towards

the  necessary  account  (guest  account  in  the  guest  folio).  With  this  system,  there  is  no requirement of any phone company operators or staff to place the call. For the activation of phone calls in the guest rooms the front desk clerk has to enter the guest's name and room number into the data bank, which automatically keeps the call charges updated.

Cash Register: This is used to record any cash transactions. Today posting machine and computer  have  taken  the  place  of  cash  register  with  the  printing  device  for  producing various cash reports like sales receipts, price control reports etc. There are several keys which  can  be  used  to  record  data  like  amount  of  transaction,  its  type,  concerned department, its purpose, method of payment and so on.

Wake-Up Devices: This  is  an  alarm  clock  that  is  used  by  the  front  office  assistant  to remind  them  to  awaken  the  guest  as  per  the  request.  Presently  this  wake  services  are replaced  by  in  room  wake  up  messages  through  computer  interfacing  (automatic  call dispensing system).

Luggage  Trolleys  and  Bell  Hop  Trolleys: It  is  important  that  the  trolleys  are  well maintained, proper greasing and oiling is done in time and in case of brakes, make sure that they function properly. Also make sure that their movements are well controlled and move only in required guided direction. There is no squeaking or rattling noise when the trolleys are moved. However avoid excessive oiling as the oil drops may cause stains on floors  and  carpet  which  may  be  difficult  to  remove  and  may  also  cause  accidents.  The trolleys should fit in easily along with the guest and bellboy without creating overloaded condition in the elevator cage:

Telecommunication Equipment : you may find following telecommunication equipments in hotels:

PBX-  (Private  branch  Exchange) -  this  equipment  takes  inbound  calls  to  the hotels  operator's  console,  through  whom  the  calls  are  further  diverted  to  the respective  areas.  With  these  types  of  systems,  number  of  telephones  lines  is limited. Outbound calls normally do require an operator. Charging of calls is also done  by  the  operator.  With  a  PABX  (private  automated  branch  exchange)  the problem of calculation is eliminated with the usage of individual meters for each extension. The need of the operator is also eliminated.

Call accounting system - this system eliminates the requirements of any telephone company  or  any  operator  for  any  billing  purpose.  As  discussed  above,  it's software.

Pager and cellular phones - some hotels give a pager or the cellular phones on rent as soon as guests check in. billing is done according to usage shown in the meter. This system is not diverted through any CAS but is been posted manually.

Other  Equipments: Other  equipments  comprises  of  Fax  machine,  Telex,  credit  card imprinter (automatic as well as manual), credit card validator, time stamp and the latest technology i.e., the call detection system.

## 2.6.4 Organizational Structure of Front Office and Job Description of Staff

A hotel can be called as an organization because it is also a business which is set up to achieve certain goals (Guest satisfaction and revenue maximization) with the help of food and beverage services and accommodation for its guest. Also it plans and coordinates the activities of other staff to achieve its goals and also it divides personnel into functional departments each with their own areas of authority and responsibility. Requirements of Organization for proper functioning are:

Division of labour : - every job must be well defined and should possess a definite place in organization

Source  of  authority :  -  authority  means  having  the  right  to  acquire  work  from others

Span  of  Control :  -  the  limited  number  of  subordinates  whose  activities  are interrelated that a person can effectively supervise is called span of control

All  organization  should  have  well  defined  mission  and  objectives  and  to  meet  these mission and objectives every organization requires a formal structure. A common way to represent that is through an organizational chart which is a schematic representation of relationship between positions within an organization or a graphical presentation of the hierarchical frameworks. They are arranged in levels of hierarchical status connected by lines suggesting the different types of authority.

Using the minimum and maximum requirements of a hotel for the span of control we can design the organizational hierarchy or chart for the hotel. As the organization of staff will depend upon the size of the hotel the front office organization structure of the small hotels is shown below:

The front office staff interacts with all departments of the hotel, including marketing and sales,  housekeeping, food and beverage, banquet, controller, maintenance, security, and sales,  housekeeping, food and beverage, banquet, controller, maintenance, security, and human resources. These departments view the front office as a communication liaison in providing guest services. Each of the departments has a unique communication link with the front office staff.

-  Housekeeping Department
-  Food and Beverage Department
-  Sales and Marketing Department
-  Maintenance or Engineering Department

HOUSEKEEPING  DEPARTMENT: Rooms  sell  are  the  major  source  of  revenue generation for the hotel. The major function of front office is to sell the room, but to make the room ready for the sell is the part of housekeeping. So Housekeeping and the front office works in close coordination with each other. They communicate with each other for the following information about

Room Status :  -  the  report  on  the  availability  of  the  rooms  for  immediate  guest occupancy i.e. depicts the entire picture of all the room position or status of guest room.    Housekeeping  room  status  can  be  described  in  the  following communication terms:

- · Available Clean, or Ready-room is ready to be occupied
- · Occupied-guest or guests are already occupying a room
- · Stay over-guest will not be checking out of a room on the current day
- · Dirty  or  On-Change-guest  has  checked  out  of  the  room,  but  the housekeeping staff has not released the room for occupancy
- · Out-of-Order-room  is  not  available  for  occupancy  because  of  a mechanical malfunction

Once  the  housekeeping  is  ready  with  the  housekeeping  room  status  report  it  is send  to  the  front  office,  where  it  is  checked  and  compared  with  front  office occupancy report this helps front office to

- · Update room status
- · Know the exact house count
- · Find sleepers (a room from which the guest has checked out but is showing as occupied in front office status record)

- · Charge if any extra person has occupied the room

Discrepancy  Report: A  discrepancy  report  is  prepared  by  the  front  desk  on receiving the Room Report from the Housekeeping. The front office compares it with  the  Room  Rack  for  reconciliation  of  room  status.  Discrepancies  noticed between  Room  Rack  and  Housekeeping  Room  Report  are  noted  down  on  a separate report called the -discrepancy report‖ which is then handed over to a bell boy for physical check and reporting back of the room under discrepancy. After a physical  check of the room the bell boy  notes down the correct status which is accepted by the front office and room rack and reconciled accordingly.

Discrepancy Report

<!-- image -->

Room Clearance Arrangement: When a guest checks out, the front office has to immediately  inform  the  housekeeping  desk  (which  is  the  central  point  of information for housekeeping) or the floors, to clean the room so that it is ready for  sale  again.  This  information  is  controlled  on  a  Departure  Intimation  control sheet. Housekeeping in return would have to inform the front office immediately after  a  room  has  been  cleaned  and  prepared  for  sale  to  the  guest.  In  technical parlance  when  the  front  desk  informs  the  housekeeping  desk  about  a  check  out room, it  is  referred  to  as  giving  a  -departure  room‖  to  housekeeping  and  when housekeeping informs the front office about the rooms which are ready for sale, it is known as -cleared room‖.

Special  Arrangements: Guest    may  request  for  additional  or  special  amenities during  their  stay  like  personal  toiletry  items  such  as  shampoo,  toothpaste, mouthwash, and electrical equipment etc, and when such request is made to front office, they immediately convey it to housekeeping department .For special guest like VIPs and groups the front office may request the house keeping department to put extra amenities in the guest room like flower arrangements etc.

Security: The house keeping personnel should inform the front office about any unusual circumstances that may indicate a violation of security for the hotel guest.

## FOOD AND BEVERAGE DEPARTMENT :  The  front  office  department  coordinates

with the food and beverage department for the following information:

- · Arrival and departure of guests
- · Setting up bar in VIP rooms
- · Special arrangement like cookies, fruit basket, and assorted dry fruits.
- · In house and expected VIP's and corporate guest
- · In house and expected groups
- · In house and expected crews
- · The  scanty  baggage  in  house  guests,  all  points  of  sale  are  notified  to receive all payment in cash from these guests.
- · Groups and guests with booking of specific meal plan.

Thus the front  desk  will  provide  the  food  and  beverage  department  with  a  guest  room Special amenities request form. The food & beverage department then arranges for item such as welcome fruit basket with fruits, chocolates and wine to be put in the guest room. For  groups,  the  food  &  beverage  department  will  need  the  front  desk  to  provide information  on  meal  arrangements  so  as  to  reserve  seats  in  the  outlets  or  conference rooms for guests' meals.

SALES AND MARKETING DEPARTMENT: The  sales  and  marketing  department needs to work closely with the front desk and reservations department for reservations of groups,  tours  and  corporate  bookings.  The  front  desk  will  provide  to  the  sales  and marketing department updated information on:

- · guest histories
- · room reservation records
- · current room availability status

The guest  history  is  a  valuable  resource  for  marketing  and  sales,  which  uses  the  guest history information to target marketing campaigns, develop promotions, prepare mailing labels, and select appropriate advertising media.

The front office staff must make every effort to keep this database on room availability status and guest histories current and accurate. The marketing and sales executives may have to check the lists of available rooms three, six, or even twelve months in the future to develop marketing strategies for future period especially for lean period or off season period to be sure the hotel have desired occupancy throughout the year.

This  information  also  helps  the  sales  and  marketing  department  to  sell  the  product  by bundling  two  or  more  product  like  room  with  meal  or  room,  meal  and  sightseeing  all clubbed together to form a package is prepared keeping in minds the need of the target clientele. It is also the front office's job to make a good first impression on the public, to relay messages, and to meet the requests of guests who are using the hotel for meetings, seminars, and banquets.

Thus  a  close  coordination  and  cooperation  between  the  front  office  and  sales  and marketing department is important for hotel profitability.

MAINTENANCE  OR  ENGINEERING  DEPARTMENT: The  maintenance  or engineering  department  and  front  office  communicate  on  room  status  and  requests  for maintenance service required for the equipments and systems installed in the hotel. Front office  informs  the  maintenance  department  of  any  work  required  in  guest  room. Maintenance employees must know the occupancy status of a room before attending to plumbing,  heating,  or  air-conditioning  problems.  If  the  room  is  reserved,  the  two departments work out a time frame so that the maintenance work is carried out in absence of the guest, and in case of heavy work need to be done, the guest can be requested to change the room.

The  engineering  department  is  responsible  for  maintaining  properly  the  hotel  facilities under the care of the front office department such as the proper of functioning of the guest lift.

SECURITY DEPARTMENT: Communications  between  the  security  department  and the front office are important in providing security to the guest.

The front desk staff may also provide labour to prepare the daily announcement board, an inside listing of the daily activities of the hotel (time, group, and room assignment), and marquee, the side message board, which includes the logo of the hotel and space for a message. The majority of banquet guests are not registered guests in the hotel, for them, the front office is a logical communications center, as nonresident guest who are unaware of  the  hotel  lay  out  will  contact  the  front  office  for  the  direction  of  the  revenue.  The banquet  department  sends  function  prospectus  to  front  office  also  so  that  if  any communication from the parties hosting the functions reaches the front desk , the same may  be  transferred  or  replied  promptly.  the  preparation  of  marquee  with  different messages for the banquet guest is also handled by front office..

The persons responsible for paying the bills for a special event will also find his or her way to  the  front  office  to  settle  the  city  ledger  accounts.  If  the  banquet  captain  is  not available to personally present the bill for the function, the front desk clerk is informed (specially during the night) about the specifics of food and beverage charges gratuities, rental changes, method of payment, and the like so that he can present the banquet bill to the specific guest and even collect payment in absence of banquet captain.

## 2.6.6 Log Book

One of the most important register found at the front office is - log book. The log book is used  to  record  all  messages  that  staff  from  an  earlier  shift  wants  to  convey  to  the employees on the next shift, all supervisors and staff reporting for duty must read the log book before starting their duty for any important message left for them by the staff of the previous shift.

Each of the hotels must have and use a Front Office Log Book so that front office staffs are aware of important events and decision that occurred during previous shifts. The Log books are like daily journal and must be a bound (sewn, not loose leaf or spiral bound) ledger or diary with stamp or machine numbered consecutive pages. The reason the book should be sewn is so that removing pages is not as simple as a loose leaf or spiral book. In the log book front office staff records: - unusual events, guest complains or request and other relevant information throughout their shit. These notes should be clearly written in a prescribed form so that can serve as effective reference for next shift as well as for future. Before  beginning  their  shit  front  office  supervisors  and  agents  should  review  the  log book, notify any current activities, situations that require follow up or potential problems. Complete Logbook is so much more than a logbook- it is more of a full workbook for anything  a  manager  needs.  Get  the  visibility,  consistency  and  accountability  that  one

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

## 2.7 Guest Services and Relations

As  the  guest  checks  into  the  hotel,  they  start  availing  various  services  and  facilities offered by the hotel during their stay in the hotel. The stay is the third  phase of  guest cycle. This stage is very important for the hotel as the guest good experience is very much essential  and  crucial  in  generating  repeat  business  and  for  free  mouth  publicly  of  the hotel.  So,  the  hotel  tries  to  provide  a  more  professional  way  to  handle  the  services provided to the guest. Different guest services provided by front office are:

- · Mail & Message Handling
- · Paging of the guest
- · Safety Deposit Lockers
- · Room Change Procedure
- · Wakeup Calls
- · Guest Complains

## 2.7.1  Mail Handling

Mail  Handling  is  a  very  important  activity  of  the  front  desk  and  the  way  the  mail  is handled shows the efficiency and attitude of the hotel staff. When guests are away from their  homes because of  any  reason may be business, official, personal etc, they need  a contact address where they can receive their urgent mails, couriers, fax, parcels etc. Very often guests travelling and staying at hotels need to be contacted by their family or their colleagues of their office. Thus, they may receive letters, parcels and packets at the hotel address. The guest might also want to communicate with them. The hotel in such cases acts as an agent for receiving or forwarding such mail or messages.

All the mails addressed to the hotel are received by the front office and depending upon the hotel policy, mails are either handled by the front desk, bell desk or information desk. It  is  a  vital  duty  of  the  front  office  department  to  hand  over  all  mails  to  the  respective guest  without  any  delay.  Any  delay  and  carelessness  shown  by  the  staff  may  result  in great dissatisfaction.  The term mail handling covers up both incoming and outgoing mail. Following are some of the sources of mails:

- · Fax
- · Emails
- · Telegrams
- · Letters and Parcels

INCOMING MAIL: As per the policy of the hotel the incoming mail may be received at the  front  desk  or  by  the  information  desk.  Incoming  guest  mails  may  further  classified into two categories:

- · Ordinary guest mail
- · Registered guest mail

Ordinary  Guest  Mail: The  mails  of  which  no  delivery  record  is  maintained  by  the delivering agency (postman) are known as ordinary mails. But, hotel keeps a record of all received mails at the desk in a mail log book to avoid any kind of future discrepancy.

Registered Guest Mail: The mails whose delivery record is maintained by the delivering agency (postman) are known as registered mails.  It is advisable not to accept tampered registered  mails.  When  registered  mails  are  received,  they  are  recorded  in  the  mail  log book and the guest's signature is taken at the time of delivery.

Types of Incoming Mails

<!-- image -->

Procedure for Handling Guest Mail: The standard mail delivery process is as under:

- · The incoming mails (ordinary or registered) received are first stamped date and time and entry is made in the mail log book and then these are sorted out at the counter itself.

Mail for in-house guest/ Resident Guest Mail/Present Guest Mail: The mails of the resident guest are delivered in the guest rooms by the bell boy, if the guest is present in the room and his signature is taken in the mail log book.

In case the room key is in the pigeon hole i.e. if the guest is not in the hotel, or sometimes the guest may go out of his room without leaving the key on the counter the mail is placed in the key rack and a mail advice slip refer is put on the key knob of door so that if he goes to room directly he would know about the mail which the hotel has received in his absence, and later mail is delivered to the guest along with his room key when he come to collect room keys. These days hotels use message light on the telephone or on the door and also computers are used for this purpose in some hotels.

## 2.7.2   Message Handling

Receiving  messages  for  in  house  guests  in  their  absence,  recording  them  and communicating  them  to  the  guests  as  soon  as  possible  is  an  important  function  of  the front desk staff. A message can be received either by telephone call or in person or visitor coming  to  meet  the  guest.  The  need  for  receiving  message  for  the  in-house  guest  is important when the guest is not in the room. He may be out of the hotel or within the hotel but not in his room.

Very often people come to the hotel to meet the guest in person or people related with the guests might want to leave a message or talk to the guest over the telephone. When the guest is not available in the hotel then a message needs to be taken on guest behalf and then communicated to him or her. The recording of guest messages can be done manually or by computer. In case of manual message recording system -Message Slip‖ needs to be filled out. While hotels using computers have automated systems for delivering messages to guests.

The telephone in the guest room has a message indicator that can be switched on by the front desk in case any message is waiting for a guest. The message light will flash on the telephone instrument in the guest room. This prompts the guest that there is a message for him and he may call the front desk to receive it. In some hotels the message details may also be fed into computer and the guest may view it on the television screen in his room. Every hotel has its own standard operating procedure for handling guest Message. The common procedure followed is:

-  When there is a telephone call or visitor for the guest, the front desk staff checks whether the guest is resident guest, check out guest or future or yet to arrive guest.
-  In case of resident guest, the FO staff should check whether he is present in his room or not. If the guest is in the room, the front desk staff should immediately connect the caller or inform the guest about the visitor.
-  If the guest is not present in his room than the front office staff should check the mail  and  key  rack  for  the  location  form  or  any    instructions  left  by  the  guest thereby act accordingly
-  If  the  guest  has  not  left  any  instructions  or location form at  the  front  desk,  the front  office  assistant  should  note  down  the  message  on  the  message  slip  refer format, the three copies of message slip are prepared. The first or the original copy is placed in the key and mail rack and is delivered to the guest when he comes to collect  his  room  key,  the  second  is  slipped  under  his  room  door,  and  the  third remains in the message book for reference A Message Slip should be filled out

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

completely and the complete details, name and contact details of the visitor/caller should be noted so that the guest can be informed of the same. The message noted should  be  repeated  and  confirmed  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  message  noted  is correct and complete.

-  1 st copy of message slip
-  kept in mail and key rack
-  2 nd copy of message slip
-  slip pending the guestroom
-  3 rd copy of message slip
-  kept in the books

-  Sometimes hotel also receives message for the guests who are expected to arrive or have already departed checked out of the hotel. If there is visit or a call for the guest who has already check out of the hotel, than front office agent checks, and give  information  as  per  instructions  left  by  the  guest  in  the  mail  and  message forwarding slip
-  Guests  who  are  expected  to  arrive  in  future  will  have  their  messages  filed  in alphabetical  order  and  send  to  back  office  where  the  slip  is  attached  to  their reservation record and when preparing the registration form GRC (preregistration) the slip will be attached to GRC so that message can be delivered to guest at the time  of  check  in.  The  accurate  handling  of  messages  and  their  delivery  is  very essential.  In  case  a  message  is  received,  and  if  not  promptly  given  to  the  guest concerned may cause problems or embarrassment which could result in a strong complaint.

## 2.7.3   Paging

The paging is a system of locating the guest within the premises of the hotel. When the guest is expecting a visit or call, but does not want to wait for it in the room is within the hotel so he may fill the location form and leave that to reception, the front desk than sends the bell boy with the page board on which the guest name is written to locate the guest in specified area of the hotel

Location form: Many times the in - house guest expects a phone call or a visitor but decides  not  to  wait  in  the  room,  and  might  decide  to  go  to  a  public  area  such  as  bar, restaurant, swimming pool, Lobby or lounge etc. of the hotel or may go out of the hotel. In such cases the hotel requests the guest to tell about his whereabouts through a location form. This form is kept in the stationery folder in the room as well as also available at the information  counter.  The  filled  location  form  is  kept  in  the  key  and  mail  racks.  This information is sent to telephone department also. The purpose of form is to identify the area of paging and save time. In case of computer system the information is recorded in computer instead of location forms.

## Location Form

Page  Board  System: The  most  commonly  used  system  is  called  Page  Board  System. This is a simple system in which the bell boy / page boy is required to carry a small board which has a small handle and small bells attached to it. The receptionist or information list writes the name of the guest and his room on the board, and the bell boy / page boy carries this board to the public area which has been mentioned on the location form by the guest  and  keeps  ringing  the  attached  bells.  This  attracts  the  attention  of  the  guest immediately.

Public Address system: Another system which is used to page the guest was P.A system. In hotels piped/relayed or channeled music is played in all the public area from the central room generally in the front office. The switch of it is with the receptionist or information assistant  who  to  page  the  guest  will  switch  the  music  from  all  the  public  areas  and announces (with mike and speaker) the name of the guest and his room number. this is transmitted to  all  the  public  areas  thereby  saving  the  time  and  energy  of  bell  boy.  The communication skills  of  the  person  announcing  the  name  of  the  guest  is  important  his voice should be clear, correct and sweet

## 2.7.6   Wakeup Call procedure

The facility of awakening the sleeping guest as desired by the guest is called wakeup call. A wake up call  is  generally  a  telephone  call  made  by  the  operator  to  the  guest  at  the specific time mentioned by the guest.  It is like a telephone alarm to wake the sleeping guest. The wakeup call request is entered in the wake up call register.

Generally the telephone section is responsible for giving wake up call to the guest, but lobby personnel specially bell desk also get involved in case wakeup call is to be given to group or crew at the time registered by the group leader or airport authorities.

## Procedure for wakeup call:

- 1. When the guest calls for wakeup calls allow him/her to give the details
- 2. Fill the wakeup call sheet and register properly repeating each instruction clearly and precisely.
- 3. The main information which  required are:
- o Name of the guest
- o The guest room number
- o The date and time of the wakeup call
- o Repeat the entire information once again to clarify.
- 4. At the allotted time call the guest by saying -good morning sir this is your six o clock wakeup calls i.e. wishing the guest according to the time and giving wakeup call.

## There can be different responses:

- o The guest does not pick up the call
- o The guest pick up the call but will not answer
- o The guest will pick but gives sleepy grunt
- o The guest will thank the operator for the call
- o The guest will ask the operator to give the wakeup call at another time.

## Each will have different follow up

- 5. Always  call  the  guest  after  five  minutes  saying  -Mr.  …  this  is  your  second wakeup call. Have a nice day.
- 6. For the guest who does not respond to the wakeup call contact the lobby manager immediately who will either instruct the bell boy to give the physical wakeup call by  going  to  guest  room  and  if  required  to  lobby  manager  will  himself  go  as  to wake up the guest by entering in the guest room with the use of master key as a guest not responding to any type of wakeup call may be in the need of medical emergency.
- 7. For the guest who is asking for other time ,note the new time in the wake up call sheet confirm the same and remove the old time mentioned from the wakeup call sheet.
- 8. An operator has the discretion of calling the guest at third time if the guest picks the phone and gives no answer or a sleepy grunt. The operator would like to get a verbal response from the guest..
- 9. After  giving  the  second  wakeup  call  strike  the  guest  off  from  the  list  on  the wakeup call sheet.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

Modern hotels have sophisticated software which automatically gives the wake up call. The  operator  notes  and  feed  the  details  in  the  computer  -  the  guest  name,  his  room number and date and time when wakeup call is required. The software will automatically call  the  room  at  the  given  time  and  the  recorded  voice  will  inform  the  guest  about  the wakeup call. The software automatically calls after 5minutes to make the second call with the proper message. Though impersonal but it is highly effective.

While all of these calls can be completed without operator assistance,  guests sometime ask front office staff  for assistance in placing calls.   In addition, a single call often fits into more than one category of call. For example, A direct dial long distance call could also credit card call, a person to person call could also be a collect call, a local call could be to an internet service provider and international call could be a person to person credit card call.  For many of these of calls, the hotel can charge guests a surcharge for use of its telephone technology.

calling  for  a  flat  daily  charge.   Some  hotels  don't  charge  guests  for  local  calls.   Each charge or individual hotel determines its own local call policy.

Direct Dial Long Distance Calls: Direct Dial Long Distance Call are most common calls hotel guests place a long distance call determinates outsides the local calling area.  Once a long distance number is dialed it is distributed over phone company office, which roots the  call  to  whatever  long  distance  carrier  the  hotel  selected  to  handle  its  long  distance traffic Direct Dial Long Distance Calls are also typically required to as -1+‖ dial a ‗1‖ after accessing an outside line, then dial the area code and the telephone number.  They are attending to reach together; this string of numbers eliminates the need for telephone operator involvement.

The guest informs the operator that the call is collect, to be billed to the receiving party.  The operator stays on the line and verifies that the receiving party accepts the charges most telephone companies pay a commission to the hotels for collect calls placed by guests.

Third Party Calls: Third Party calls are similarly to collect calls except that the billed number is not the called number.  In most cases, the operator may require that someone at the  3rd  party  number  accepts  the charge  before  putting  the  call  through.   The  hotel's telephone company bills the 3rd party and the amount does not appear an guest's folio. The hotel may apply sur-charge or other fee for this service.

Person  To  Person  Calls: Person  to  Person  Calls  are  not  connected  unless  a  specific party name by the caller verify that he/she is on the line.

## 3.2 Introduction

As we already now know that the main source of income for the hotels comes from the rooms division  and,  the  rooms  division  comprises  of  two  major  departments,  the  front office and housekeeping, which are involved in the sales or services of rooms to guests. The three main functions of the front office are as follows:

-  Selling rooms
-  Maintaining balanced guest accounts
-  Providing services and information to guests

It is the responsibility of the front office to ensure that the guest do not face any kind of problem during their entire stay at the hotel. The guest of the hotel has four main stages of interaction  with  the  hotel  which  is  called  guest  cycle.   The  guest  cycle  describes  the activities  that  each  guest  passes  by  from  the  moment  he/she  calls  to  communicate  a reservation inquiry till he/she departs from the hotel. In fact, the guest cycle encompasses four  different  stages  and  each  stage  of  the  guest  cycle  is  associated  guest  service,  and guest accounting activity.

Guest Cycle: Below is a description of the activities undertaken at each stage of the guest cycle:

-  Pre-arrival: The stage where the guest makes room reservation.
-  Arrival: The point when the guest arrives at the hotel.
-  Occupancy: The period during which the guest stays in the hotel.
-  Departure: The point when the guest checks out and leaves the hotel.

Guest Cycle

<!-- image -->

Pre Arrival: The Guest chooses a hotel during the pre- arrival stage of the guest cycle. Choice of the guest can be affected by many factors which includes:

-  previous experiences with the hotel,
-  advertisement,
-  word of mouth referral by friends and colleagues,
-  location,
-  corporate,
-  travel agent booking,
-  Hotel name, hotel loyalty program member etc.

The guest's decision of making the reservation can also be effected by the ease of making the reservation and the way reservation agent interacted and described the facility of the hotel like room type, room rate, recreational facilities and other attractions near the hotels etc. We  can  certainly  call  the  reservation  area  as  the  sales  office  for  non-corporate  or group  bookings.  Its  employees  should  be  sales  orientated  and  present  positive,  strong image of the hotel.

If  a  reservation  can  be  accepted,  the  reservation  agent  create  a  reservation  on  the  hotel management software. The creation of this reservation record starts the hotel guest cycle. This  reservation  contains  details  of  guest  specific request  which  will  help  the  hotel  to provide the guest with personalized service during his stay. The details which is collected during  the  reservation  also  helps  the  hotel  to  complete  pre-registration  activities  like assign room according to guest request, room rate to be charged to the guest folio during the course of stay etc.

Although the reservation details helps in providing  guests with anticipatory service the primary objective of making the reservation is to make sure that room will be available when he arrives to the hotel.

Arrival: The arrival stage of the guest cycle includes registration and room assignment process.  After  the  guest  arrives,  he  or  she  establishes  a  business  relationship  with  the

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

hotel through front office. It is the front office staff responsibility to clarify any query of the guest especially the details of room rate of packages he /she is booked on.

Front  office  staff  should  determine  the  guest's  reservation  status  before  beginning  the check-in  /  registration  process.  Guest  with  reservation  and  guest  without  reservation commonly known as Walk-in's also provide a opportunity of business for front desk staff. A Registration card or GRC is printed and completed at the time of check in, which will help the front desk to collect essential information. The GRC should contain details like billing instructions, reservation details, number of adults and children occupying, address, passport  and  visa  for  foreign  nationals,  full  address,  personal  details  and  credit  card details. Because  the  guest  and  hotel  gains  certain  legal  benefits it  is  mandatory  to  get guest signature on the registration card.

The registration process is complete once a method of payment and the guest's departure date have been confirmed and duly signed by the guest. The guest may be given a room key and direction to the room or escorted by the guest service associate or guest service manager. When the guest checks-in to the room the occupancy stage of the guest cycle begins.

Occupancy: The manner in which the front office staff represents the hotel is important during  the  occupancy  stage.  As  the  main  contact centre  for  hotel,  the  front  office  is responsible for coordinating guest request and providing information and supplies to the guests. Front desk should take extra care to respond to the guest on a timely and accurate manner. The main focus of the front desk staff is to provide anticipatory service and to meet  or  exceed  the  guests  expectations.  This  will  encourage  the  guest  to  repeat  to  the hotel.

Security  is  also  a  main  important  concern  during  occupancy  of  the  guest.  Issues  like protection of funds and valuables are among those. The front desk should also follow the hotel  standard  operating  procedure  for  handling  the  hotel  and  guest  keys,  property surveillance,  safe  deposit  boxes,  guests  personal  property,  and  emergencies  are  also important.

A variety  of  charges  restaurant  charges,  telephone,  internet,  travel  desk  etc.  during  the occupancy stage affect guest and hotel account. Most of these charges will be posted to the guest account according to front office posting procedures. And also in most cases the Room charges is the single largest charge on the guest folio. Other front office financial tasks during the occupancy stage is to verify the charges posted to the guest account and checking guest accounts against the credit limit.

Departure: Guest services and guest accounting aspects of the guest cycle are completed during the cycle's fourth and final phase ie departure. At Departure the guest vacates the room, receives the accurate statement of the settled accounts, returns the room keys and leaves  the  hotel.  Once  the  guest  has  checked  out,  front  office  updates  the  rooms' availability status and notifies the housekeeping department. ( For hotels using Property management software the status of the room is updated automatically ). At this stage front office also collect the feedback of the guest experience in the hotels by handing over the guest feedback form.

The first interaction between the guest and the hotel begins when the guest enquires about the room availability and makes the room booking or reservation in the hotel. With the globalization and revolution in the field of travel and tourism, and with the increase in the disposable income of people, more and more people wants to travel to different places.

This increase in movement of tourist has increased the demand for tourist accommodation in  the  destination  and  to  have  safe  and  comfortable  stay  in  the  destination  guest  now prefer to make advance reservation in hotels. Hotel also these days relies mainly on the advance booking of room as it helps them to achieve high occupancy and to maximize their revenue.

What is reservation? Reservation is the first stage of guest cycle, it can be defined as -Reservation is the activity of booking the room in advance for a prospective guest on his request for future, which may be from a few days to month in advance or can be defined as  blocking  a  particular  type  of  guest  room  (i.e.  single,  double  room.  etc),  for  the particular duration of time (i.e. number of days)and for a particular guest.

Reservation is one of the major sections of the front office department which plays the central  role  and  is  responsible  for  booking  the  hotel  room.  Reservation  section  is generally located back/behind of the reception as it does not come in direct contact with the guest. Reservation and reception to some extent are similar as they play the similar role of booking the room in the hotel. Therefore in l small hotels, Front office manager is the head of reservation section while in large hotels this section is headed by reservation manager who is assisted by reservation supervisor and assistants.

The main function of reservation is to receive the reservation request from the prospective guest, check the availability of rooms, to process the request and either to accept, wait list or deny the request, communicating it and then recording it i.e. maintaining or reservation records, files, charts, racks and computer records etc.

Importance of Reservation: As mentioned earlier  the  role  of  reservations  is  not  only limited to making reservations but also to maintain records of the hotel occupancy which helps  the  management  in  planning  for  future  and  also  helps  in  estimating  man  power requirements. The same time efficiently executed reservation goes a long way in ensuring comfortable stay for the guest.  Thus reservation department is important for both hotel and the guest.

## 3.3.2   Types of Reservation

Hotel  receive  reservation  for  their  room  only  after  checking  various  factors  such  as availability of rooms, sales forecast, room rates, profile of guests and their importance to the hotel etc.  A reservation made by the guest could be tentative, confirmed or waitlisted. Once the reservation is confirmed than hotel will, take a guaranteed or non guaranteed reservation as per the guest's requirement.

Tentative: it's  a  reservation  request  made  by  a  prospective  guest  on  a  provisional  or tentative basis for particular stay dates. The hotel fixes a cut of date, in form the same to guest, by which hotel should confirm the reservation otherwise it get cancelled, and once the confirmation by the guest is received till cutoff date the hotel changes the tentative reservation to confirmed reservation and updates the records accordingly

Waitlisted: A  reservation  is  waitlisted  when  the  requested  category  of  room  is  not available for the requested date. It gets confirmed against a cancellation  request for the same category of room is made by other guest. This way hotel ensures that its room will not remain vacant   in case of cancellation. the  hotel in such situations not guarantee a room for  waitlisted reservation. it is informed that guest will only be assigned a room in case  of  cancellation  or    no  show.  This  situation    normally    occurs  in  high  occupancy period ,like in peak season time, festival in the destination  etc. the hotel informs the guest that they are on waitlist and will only be confirmed  in case of cancellation.

Confirmed: A reservation is confirmed when hotel Blocks a room for the guest for the specific dates and send a written confirmation of the same to the guest. It is of two types:

A) Guaranteed: It's a confirmed reservation that the hotel will hold the reserved room for the guest and will not give it to any other guest even if the guest does not arrive on time .this requires the guest to make an advance payment either  partial or full depending upon the hotel policy and occupancy status of the hotel during the stay, irrespective of whether the guest avails the reservation or not unless the request  is  cancelled    according  to  the    hotel's  cancellation  policy.  by  this  way guest  will  find  their  room  ready  even  if  they  reach  late  to  the  hotel  without  an prior  information  to  the  hotel..  The  guaranteed  reservation  can  be  obtained through one of the following ways:

Advance deposit: An advance deposit guaranteed reservation requires that the guest pay the hotel the decided amount of money before their arrival.

Pre-payment: This  requires  advance  deposit  of  payment  either  full  or partial (as per hotel policy) prior to the guest arrival. This is normally the most desirable form of a guaranteed reservation.

Credit  card: Guaranteeing  reservations  through  credit  card  are  most popular  method  of  payment  in  the  business  hotel.  Depending  upon  the financial  status  and  money  in  bank,  the  credit  card  is  issued  to  the buyers/clients.

Travel  agents: Guest  pays  the  travel  agent  in  advance  for  their  tour packages and the travel agent guarantees the clients reservation. In case of no  show  the  hotel  generally  bills  the  travel  agency  for  payment  and according to agreement.

Corporate guarantee: This is a contractual agreement between Corporation  Company  and  hotel  which  state  that  the  corporation  will accept financial responsibility for any no-show guest.

Allotment: It  is  a set of rooms booked for a particular period of time for the  company  or  group,  this  type  of  reservation  is  made  for  training, conferences and conventions and private parties.

- B) Non-Guaranteed Reservation: When a guest confirms his reservation in the hotel  but  does  not  guaranteed  it  with  an  advance  deposit,  it  is  termed  as  Nonguaranteed  reservation.  In  this  Hotel  holds  the  room  for  the  guest  till  the cancellation  hours,  unless  the  guest  informs  the  hotel  about  his  late  arrival.  the cancellation hour is the time fixed by the hotel after which the non guaranteed is considered cancelled and the room is released for other  guest, generally in hotel the cancellation time is 6 :00pm.if  the guest does not arrive by the cancellation hour the hotel is free to release the room for other  guest. There by it is also called as  provisional  reservation  where  rooms  are  not  secured  as  that  in  guarantee reservation.

## 3.3.3   Modes of Reservation

The  process  of  reservation  begins  with  an  inquiry.  A  guest  may  contact  the  hotel  for reservation either in writing or verbally.

Modes of Reservation

<!-- image -->

WRITTEN MODE: When the reservation request reaches the hotel in writing, the mode is classified as written mode of reservation. The different written modes of reservation are letter, fax, email. The merit of written mode are is that they are clear, un ambiguous, act as a proof because of written form as well as can be referred again and again  and can be filed. They are:

Letter: A  letter  is  a  good  mode  of  making  reservation  request.  But  If  the  guest send their letters to the hotel it requires several month in advance(as to reach the hotel and further action to be taken). This mode is commonly used by travel agent, tour operators and corporate houses, which send reservation request on their letter heads.  As  this  method  is  time  consuming  so  now  a  days  this  method  is  also becoming old fashioned.

Fax: Fax, or facsimile transmission, uses electronic scanning techniques to send copies of document/ written statements and graphics over an ordinary telephone line  to  a  special  machine  that  prints  out  an  identical  copy  at  the  other  end.  It  is much faster and cheaper than sending a letter.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

E-mail: Due to fast advancement and development of internet all over the world, today  most  of  the  hotel  allows  reservation  online  on  the  internet  through  their websites Email is the mail sent by  electronic means from one computer user to one or more recipients via a network from anywhere in the world. It is the fastest cheapest and convenient mode as it provides a written record for future as well.

VERBAL MODE: Reservation request may also be made through oral communication i.e. either in person or on telephone. The main advantage of this mode is that it is fast, cheapest,  convenient  and  generates  immediate  feedback  or  response  from  the  guest though its biggest disadvantage is the there is no written record. They are:

In Person: If an individual or his representative comes to the hotel to book rooms for future, it is called In-Person mode of reservation request. This is a good mode of  reservation  as  the  person  is  available  to  consider  the  various  option  and suggestion, in case the room ,or its availability, or its rate does not match the guest expectation  .The  hotel  processes  the  reservation  as  per  the  details  given  by  the guest and gives him the confirmation number and letter.

Telephone: this  is  the  most  commonly  used  mode  of  reservation    as  the Reservation  request  comes  to  the  hotel  through  telephone  calls  It  is  the  fast, convenient  and  generates  immediate  response  or  feedback  and  one  can  get  the complete information and clear doubts on telephone. The disadvantage is that it does not provide a permanent record.

-  Forecast Board,

## AUTOMATIC SYSTEM

-  Automated reservation system is computerized reservation that is ideally suited to dealing  with  the  large  amount  of  information  which  needs  to  be  extracted  in  a number of ways. Consequently a computer is an ideal tool for a hotel to employ for storing and retrieve room status information and conduct transaction
-  Guest goes on line and book the room which automatically blocks the room for the desired duration of time and removes the room from the availability records.
-  Generates electronic confirmation letters that are sent to the guest email addresses or postal address.
-  It  also  automatically  generates  report  like  occupancy  record  or  forecast  and  list like expected arrival list, expected departures list etc.eg CRS and GDS
-  In  either  of  three  systems  used  by  the  hotel  the  detail  are  first  filled  in  the reservation form.

Step  5:  Confirming  the  reservation  request: When guest  and  hotel  agree  on room and rates then reservation assistant confirms reservation request.    There are two  types  of  reservation  request  and  they  are guaranteed and  non-guaranteed reservation.  To  confirm  the  hotel  rooms  the  confirmation  should  be  in  written form  not  in  the  verbal  way.  Reservation  assistance  should  maintain  the confirmation slip and send it to the reception.

Step 6: Maintaining the reservation request: Once confirming the room to the guest,  we  need  to  make  a  reservation  record  for  each  and  every  booking  made. The records can be maintained or processed in two ways:

Documenting the original reservation : In this process we file and record the original reservation  details and if we are working in a computerized system  we  will  be  recording  a  printed  form  of  reservation  done.  The documentation  is  done  on  the  basis  of  date  of  arrival  and  afterward  in assurance to the surname of guest.

Modification of reservation : The next step in processing is changing of the details that are recorded in reservation form. In this case, we need to attach the different amendment/ cancellation form or slip with the original one.  In  this  process  of  modifying  the  reservation  request,  the  guest  can make amendment and/or cancel the request.

## Amendment procedure:

-  Take  the  Hotel  Reservation  Revision  /  Cancellation  Form and note down the revisions or changes made by the guest.
-  Amend the Hotel Reservation Chart by removing the room allocation  made  of  the  earlier  dates  and  allocating  the rooms on the new dates.
-  Amend the reservation slip from the rack.
-  Assign a new Hotel reservation confirmation number.

## Cancellation procedure:

-  Take  the  Reservation  Revision  /  Cancellation  Form  and note the name, address and telephone number of the person making the cancellation.
-  Amend the Hotel Reservation Chart.
-  Remove the reservation slip from the rack

Step 7: Compiling the reservation request: This is the last step in which all the reservation information are distributed to all different departments. Night auditor will maintain the room status report with the mode of payments, nationality, no. of packs, etc.

## HOTEL RESERVATION REPORTS

Reservation Transactions Report : - This report summarizes daily reservations activity in  terms  of  reservation  record  creation,  modification  and  cancellation.  Other  possible reports include specialized summaries such as cancellation reports, blocked room reports, and no-show reports.

Commission  Agent  Report :  -  Agents  with  contractual  agreements  may  be  owed commission for business booked at the property. This report tracks the amounts the hotel owes to each agent.

Turn Away Report / Refusal Report :  -  This  report  tracks  the  number  of  reservation requests refused because rooms were not available for the requested dates. The turn away

report  is  especially  helpful  to  properties  operating  near  full  occupancy  or  hotels considering expansion.

Revenue  Forecast  Report :  -  This  report  projects  future  revenue  by  multiplying predicted  occupancies  by  applicable  room  rates.  This  information  can  be  especially important for long range planning and cash management strategies.

Expected Arrival & Departure Lists :  -  These lists indicate the number and names of guests  expected  to  arrive,  depart  or  stay  over.  The  arrival  list  facilitates  the  guest registration process and the expected departure lists helps to anticipate and speed up the guest account settlement and check-out.

## 3.4 Overbooking (occupancy management)

Overbooking  is  the  process  of  accepting  reservations  for  more  rooms  than  they  are available  by  the  hotel,  by  forecasting  the  number  of  no-show  reservations,  stay-overs, under-stays, and walk-ins, with the goal of attaining 100 percent occupancy is viewed by the general public with doubt.

As a future hotelier, you should prepare for the difficult task of developing a policy on overbooking. The front office manager is responsible for administering this policy.

As in many situations, overbooking tries to overcome the problem of no-shows and late cancellations  and  may  produce  advantages  by  way  of  operating  efficiencies  that  far outweigh  the  occasional  inconveniences  to  guests  and  travelers  they  have  held  hotel overbooking to be customary  and justifiable  practice  for  offsetting  the  losses  from  noshows. Hoteliers and front office managers who practice overbooking do so to meet an organization's financial objectives. They do not intentionally overbook to cause problem to the traveler. Rex S.Toh reports -the no-show rate is anywhere between 5 and 15% in most markets

Thus  the  financial  loss  due  to  no-shows  are  substantially  high.  Lost  revenues  of  this volume force the hotelier to develop an aggressive occupancy management policy. This policy is based on management of the occupancy categories into which guests are placed:

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

those with confirmed reservations, those with guaranteed reservations, stayovers, under stays,  and  walk-ins.  However,  most  hoteliers  require  a  guest  guarantee  his  or  her  stay with a credit card number to ensure their intent of arrival and thus guarantee payment for product and services on the part of the guest and hotel.

Confirmed  reservations,  is  the  prospective  guests  who  have  a  reservation  for

accommodations that is kept until a specified time, represent the critical element in noshows. After that time (usually 4:00 P.M. or 6:00 P.M.), the hotel is under no obligation to hold the reservation. The front office manager must keep accurate records of no-shows in  this  group.  Various  types  of  travelers  with  confirmed  reservations  corporate,  group, leisure have different no-show rates. Walk-in numbers are often higher if the front office manager maintains good relations with the front office managers of nearby hotels, who may refer guests to the property when their own are fully booked. Sending guests who cannot be accommodated to nearby hotels is a win-win situation for guests and hotels. Guaranteed reservations, are the prospective guests who have made a contract with the hotel for a guest room, represent a less chances of no show because the guest provides a credit card number to hold a room reservation. According to the reports that the no-show rate  for  guaranteed  reservations  was  2  percent,  compared  to  10  percent  for  confirmed reservations.  The  front  office  manager  should  investigate  these  no-shows  to  determine their sources and plan accordingly. Stayovers are currently registered guests who wish to extend their stay beyond the time for which they made reservations.

Under stays are guests who arrive on time but decide to leave before their predicted date of  departure.  Leisure  travelers  may  find  their  tourist  attraction  less  interesting  than expected. Urgent business may require the corporate client to return to the office sooner than expected. Maintaining accurate records helps the front office manager predict under stays.

When  these  occupancy  categories  are  tracked,  the  front  office  manager  can  more accurately  predict  occupancy.  The  front  office  manager  can  obtain  the  data  for  this formula by reviewing the property management system (PMS) reservation module, which lists the groups, corporate clients, and individual guests who have made reservations for a specific period. Also, the front office manager should check tourist activity in the area, business  events  planned  in  other  hotels,  and  other  local  special  events.  Permitted overbooking  rate  may  therefore  vary  from  hotel  to  hotel  -  since  hotels  with  a  high proportion  of  transient  trade  will  have  a  higher  no-show  proportion  than  a  long-stay resort, say. The rate may also vary from week to week, and should be clearly stated on the reservation  charts  for  any  given  period.  In  a  computerized  system,  the  software  will automatically  monitor  the  ratio  of  reservations  to  actual  arrivals,  and  adjust  the overbooking parameters for different periods, bookings and room types.

## Advantages of overbooking

-  It helps to Minimizes financial losses from cancellations, no-shows and shortened stays or under stays of the guest
-  It helps to Minimizes unnecessary refusals, which may send
-  prospective customers to competitors
-  As  it  is  based  on  past  statistical    and  historical  trends:  it  should  not  result  in excessive double-bookings

## Disadvantages of planned overbooking

-  Double-bookings and relocations of the guest due to double booking of the same room may lead to movement of the prospective guests: lost opportunity of lifetime revenue
-  Double-bookings  and/or  confusions  over  bookings  can  cause  unpleasant  and stressful conflict for front office and guest

Thus Front office Manager must be carefully plan for the overbooking  as it sometimes may lead to double booking which will be a difficult situation to handle for both guest and  the  hotel,  As  an  alternative  to  overbooking,  the  hotel  may  accept  bookings  on  a waiting  list,  if  guests  are  able  to  be  flexible  about  taking  rooms  on  short-notice  when cancellations occur. Or Hotel needs to have a contingency plan to re-locate or book out some  of  its  guests,  so  that  their  dissatisfaction  is  minimized  by  having  satisfactory alternative arrangements made for them.

## 3.5 Registration

As the first stage of guest cycle was pre arrival reservation is the second stage of the guest cycle i.e.  arrival  or  registration  of  guest.  Guest  registration  is  one  of  the  first  and  most lasting  impressions  on  a  hotel  customer  Registration  begins  when  the  front  desk  agent

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

extends a sincere welcome to the guest. A warm greeting sets the tone for everything. The front  desk  agent  moves  into  the  registration  process  after  determining  the  guest reservation status.

What is registration? Guest  Registration  or  making  booking  for  hotel  rooms  are  sole responsibility  of  hotel  front  office.  During  room  booking  front  office  collect  guest information and at the time of check in of the guest those reordered are used to pre fill the GRC card. Guest registration is nothing but recording the guest's information for official purposes ie gathering information from the guest. As the guest arrives in the hotel, his first contact is with front desk staff where his registration activity takes place. At the time of registration, the front office staff asks the guests to enter their personal information on the Guest Registration Card (GRC).

Registration-  Legal  Implications: As  per  the  laws  prevailing  in  the  country  -  like Foreigner's  Act  1946  and  The  registration  of  Foreigner's  rule  1992,  Registration  is mandatory  requirement  for  both;  the  guest  over  the  age  of  16  years  -  irrespective  of Indian or foreigner, ordinary personnel or VIP and the hotel ie all hotels, Regardless of the size, boarding houses and other accommodation providers must keep a record of the basic information of the guest staying, ie full name and nationality of their guests each guest must be separately registered.

Registration acts as a valid contract between the guest and the hotel in which the hotel offers to provide safe and secure boarding and lodging facilities to the guest and the guest accepts  to  pay  for  the  service  and  facilities.  In  case  of  foreigner  guest  the  front  desk should fill Form C and verify the passport and visa of the guest.

During registration, the guest is required provide basic information about them and fill up either a visitors register / hotel register. The register may be a Red Book / form or a card also called G.R. C (Guest Registration Card). It is a legal obligation for all guests to be registered in the hotel. All guests have to provide their name and nationality. In addition foreigners must provide their passport number, place of issue and next destination. Guests might register by way of recording their details in a register, on a registration card or by using a self check-in kiosk. Group guests and VIP's are often pre-registered by reception. Many  hotels  now  also  have  self  check-in  kiosks.  It  is  the  duty  of  the  receptionist  to always check the registration details to ensure that it is correct.

## Importance of registration

Registration is helpful for both guest and hotel, in various ways:

-  It satisfies the legal requirements for hotels to keep records of their guests.
-  It  provides  a  record  of  arrivals  (as  opposed  to  reservations),  which  may  help  to account for residents in the event of a fire or other disaster.
-  It  provides  management  information:  e.g..  about  the  proportion  of  arrivals  to reservations; occupancy statistics; the national origin of guests and so on.
-  It confirms guests' acceptance of the hotel's terms and conditions (if they are asked to sign the register).
-  It  occupies  the  guest  while  the  receptionist  checks  booking  records,  allocates rooms, prepares keys

## 3.5.1   Pre-registration

Pre registration activities helps to accelerate the registration process and helps in giving fast,  efficient  and  smooth  check  in  of  the  guest.  Guest  can  be  pre  registered  using  the information collected during the reservation process. Pre registration normally involves preparing  registration  documents  in  advance  of  guest  arrival.  Room  and  room  rate assignment, creation of guest folio are part of the pre registration process. Pre registration is possible for all types of guest except walk in guest as in case of walk-in guest, there is no prior interaction between the guest and the hotel.

Thus Pre- Registration is an activity of registering (filling the GRC) a guest even before his arrival, which is generally done one day before his arrival in the night or on the same day but before his arrival.

The front office for pre registration needs a list of all the guests expected on a given day to prepare for guests' arrival, with their estimated arrival times, room type (or allocated room, if any), special requirements, and so on. The arrivals list is usually generated, using the data in the bookings diary, or the reservation records the day before the arrival date.

Separate  group  arrivals  lists  and  VIP/Special  Attention  Guest  lists  may  be  generated  a week in advance, however, because such guests generally require more preparation. The copies of these list will be send to the housekeeping department (so that rooms can be prepared for new arrivals), the food and beverage department.

## 3.5.2 Registration Methods

Hotels have different ways of posting and storing registration records depending upon the requirements of a hotel the registration records may be maintained in three ways:

Bound Book: It is a big bound book or register. Guest on arrival fills his details in a line and signs in this book. It is often used in small hotels. All the pages of this are bound into thick book and therefore can be used for long time.

## The advantages of this book are:

-  Wastage of paper is minimal.
-  No filing is required
-  All the records for the duration are available in the single book

## The disadvantages of this book handling are:

-  Confidentiality of guest information cannot be maintained. The next guest can easily access the details of the previous guests.
-  The book is bulky and gets dirty and torn very soon due to frequent usage.
-  Pre-registration of guest cannot be done.
-  Only one guest can register at a time.
-  If book is lost all the records of the guest are lost forever

## Format of a hotel register (hardbound and loose leaf)

Loose Leaf Register: In this system, a separate loose leaflet is used for each day instead of a consolidated / bound register. One new page is used everyday so to some extent the confidentiality of guest information can be maintained. It is mostly suitable for medium sized hotels

## The advantages of this method are:

-  The privacy of the guest can be maintained to some extent
-  If sheet is lost only one day record is lost.
-  It is convenient to hand over to the guest to fill their details

## The disadvantages of this method are:

-  It can be easily misplaced.
-  The leaflet may not be fully filled or in some occasions single sheet may not be sufficient.

-  Filing also becomes a problem
-  Only one guest can register at a time.
-  Pre-registration of guest cannot be done
-  The sheets are required to be filled

Individual Registration or Guest Registration Card: In this system, a separate card is used for each guest. The cards may be designed so as to serve various purposes. It may be made in duplicate or triplicate with the help of carbon papers so that one copy can be sent to Government departments and the other retained by the hotel.

## The following are the advantages of this method:

-  The size of the card is small and quite handy.
-  They may also be used to serve as a guest history card.
-  Complete privacy of the guest is maintained.
-  Many guests can be registered at the same time.
-  Pre-registration of guest can be easily done

## The disadvantages of this method are:

-  They are quiet expansive
-  If not stored properly they can be lost or misplaced easily

## 3.5.3 Registration Process

The registration process consists of following steps:

- A. Identification of guests
- B. Creating the Registration Record
- C. Allotment of Room & Rate Assignment
- D. Establishing the Method Of Payment
- E. Issuing the Room Key & Completion Of Check In Procedure
- F. Filling Special Request
- A. Identification of Guest's Status: the identification of guest's status is important as the hotel process the registration of guest with confirmed reservation and walk-in guest in a slightly different way. The front desk first verifies the status of the guest - if the guest has confirmed reservation his details will be in today's arrival list and as the pre registration would be done there check in will take less time as compared to walk in guest as we have no details of the guest
- B. Creating the Registration Record :  After  the  guest  arrives  at  the  hotel;  the  front desk  agent  creates  a  registration  record  which  is  a  collection  of  important  guest information.  The  registration  record  requires  the  guest  to  write  down  his  or  her name, address and other information. As the guest signs the registration card it is considered to be the completion of registration

## The formats used during the check-in of the guests are:

Guest Registration Card (GRC) : Registration card is filled by the guest during check-in. It is a very important document from where a front desk agent gets all the information about the guest. A registration card consists of name of the guest, address, organization name and address, nationality, arrival  time  and  date,  expected  date  of  departure,  purpose  of  visit,  room number, number of person, room rate etc.

## Guest Registration Card or GRC

C Form : According to the registration of foreigner's rule 1992 Rule 14, Form C is a legal document which is mandatory to be filled by all foreign nationals except those from Nepal and Bhutan. NRI's with green cards do not have to fill this card. Children up to 16 years and diplomats from other countries are also exempted from filling C form. Two copies of Form C are made, 1st copy is sent to the Foreigner's Regional Registration Office or  FRRO,  or  to  the  Local  Intelligence  Unit  (LIU)  as  FRRO  offices  are generally located in the metropolitan cities, within 24 hrs of the arrival of the  foreigner  guest  in  the  hotel,  but  in  case  of  nationals  from  Pakistan, China and Bangladesh, Form C should reach to the nearest FRRO within 12  hrs  of  the  arrival  of  the  foreigner  guest  or  LIU  and  also  to  the  local police station whereas the  2nd copy is kept as office copy with the hotel. The source of information for the C- form is basically the visitors passport, visa and in certain cases certificate of registration.

For every FIT a separate C form is to be made. It is also important to note that two persons of same nationality can be included in one C form.

For groups, the group leader on arrival provides the passport details of all the group members and signs the guest registration card on behalf of the group. If the group members are of same nationality than a single C form for entire group is sufficient along with list of passport details attached to it.

Arrival and Departure Register : It is a register maintained by the front desk agent which monitors all the arrivals and departures on a particular day. It monitors the rooms allocated and those just vacated for helping the Housekeeping department for making rooms ready again for guests. It also helps to find out the number of people checked in so as to calculate the house count

- C. Allotment of Room & Rate Assignment: Room assignment is an important part of the registration process. Room assignment involves identifying and allocating available rooms in a specific room category to a guest, keeping in the mind the preference of the guest. Room and room rates may be pre assigned on the basis of reservation information. Room assignments are finalized during registration.

Allotment of Rooms: After filling the registration card the next step is to allot  the  room,  and,  If  a  specific  room  has  not  yet  been  allocated,  the receptionist  may  need  to  check  on  room  status  (using  various  charts, discussed later) and allocate a room. Room status documents show which rooms are occupied, which are reserved, which are currently being worked on  by  housekeeping  or  maintenance,  and  which  are  available  for immediate occupation. Available rooms can then be allocated, according to room availability - and guest preference.

While allocating rooms following points need to be considered:

-  Priority (i.e. allocation of the best rooms of a given grade or rate) should be given to VIPs and major clients, regulars (loyal returning guests), earlier bookings and longer stays.
-  Priority should be given to the requests of guests with special needs (e.g.. for accessibility for the disabled).
-  Specially  requested  rooms  should  be  marked  or  flagged  as requested  or  reserved  in  advanced  reservation  and  room  status charts, so that they aren't let to someone else by mistake.
-  A certain  number  of  the  'better'  (preferred)  rooms  might  be  'hold back', if possible, to allow for special requests on check-in.
-  Computers may be used to allocate non-requested rooms randomly or  in  rotation,  so  that  all  rooms  are  used  equally  over  time  (and available for maintenance on rotation).
-  Computerized systems may also be used to select the best available room  for  a  given  set  of  parameters  (rate,  room  type,  guest preferences and yield management).
- D. Establishing the Method of Payment - Some guests prefer to pay room charges during  registration,  in  advance  of  occupancy.  Determination  of  the  guest credibility and the mode by which he will be settling his bill is very important for the  hotel.  There  are  various  modes  which  a  guest  may  choose  while  making  a payment like cash, credit card, Bill to company etc .
- E. Issuing The Room Key - By issuing a room key the front office agent completes the registration process. For the security of both the guest and the property, room keys must be very carefully controlled. For security reasons, the front desk agent should  never  announce  the  room  number  when  handing  a  guestroom  key  to  a guest. If the hotel provides bell service, the front desk agent should introduce the bell attendant to the guest, hand the guestroom key to the bell boy and ask him or her to show the guest to the room. While escorting guest to the room, the bell boy should  familiarize  the  guest  with  hotel  information  special  features  such  as, locations  of  emergency  exits,  emergency  procedures,  restaurant  locations,  retail outlets  and  their  hours  of  operations,  and  other  appropriate  information.  Once inside the guestroom, the bell boy should explain the features of the room answer any questions and hand the room key to the guest. If the guest is displeased with the  room,  the  bell  boy  should  listen  attentively  and  bring  the  matter  to  the attention of the front desk agent for immediate action. with the issuance of keys the  check  in  procedure  of  the  guest  gets  over,  later  the  receptionist  updates  the room status records, prepares arrival notification slip (ANS) send them to concern department, creates guest folio and fills Form C in case if any and send it to the concerned authority.
- F. Filling  Special  Request -  During  registration,  the  front  office  agent  must  make sure that the special requests made by the guest during the reservations process are acted upon. Some requests may be:
-  Location - Eg. close to or far from elevator
-  View

-  Bed Type
-  Smoking / no-smoking status
-  Amenities
-  Special furnishings for disabled guests such grab bars in bathrooms
-  High-speed Internet access

## Guest Departure Errand Card

Activities at the Reception desk: The Front desk receptionist checks the list of expected checkouts for the day and will confirm with the guest his date and time of  checkout.  Departure  notification  slips  are  prepared  to  inform  the  other departments  of  the  guest's  checkout.  In  a  manual  system  the  room  racks  are updated. The departure register is also updated.

Accounting all transaction of guest bill: The front office cashier will coordinate with other departments like housekeeping for any laundry bills to be posted in guest accounts food and beverage department for any room service  bills/  restaurant  bills  etc.  Since  it  is  very  difficult  to  collect  the payment for unsettled bills after guest has checked out. Some time even guest may refuse to pay for the un-posted bills. So the cashier must ensure that all bills are posted in guest folio before bill settlement.

To Update Guest Folio By Cashier: The cashier must update guest folio by adding the last minute bills from other point of sale. To check for any late  checkout  charges  if  applicable.  For  example  if  the  hotel  checkout timing  is  12-noon  and  the  guest  depart  at  5.00  in  the  evening,  the  guest will be charged for late checkout. Cashier should make sure that all bills are posted before preparing final bill.

To Prepare Final Bill: Guest final bill is prepared on the basis of guest folios. Front office cashier must promptly enter the late checkout charges or  last  minute  bill  from  other  revenue  generating  departments.  Some common bills which are generally remain unposted in guest bill at the time of checkout are loss to the hotel revenue. To avoid any such situation of un posted  bills  in  guest  folio,  the  front  office  cashier  can  call  through telephone to other departments to send the bills to front office which can be posted without much delay or enquire with guest about their last minute bills.

The  other  department  also  should  cooperate  to  send  the  guest  bills  by deputing some staff to directly handover guest bills to front office cashier for smooth guest checkout to avoid any loss in revenue to hotel. It is very difficult  to  collect  money  from  guest  after  checkout  formalities  are completed and the guest left the hotel.

To  confirm  the  mode  of  payment  from  guest: The  method  of  bill settlement  is  generally  confirmed  with  the  guest  at  the  time  of  making room reservation or at the time of guest check in at the hotel. The guest will make appropriate entries in GUEST REGISTRATION CARD. So that it  is  easy for the cahier to perform checkout in professional manner. The mode of payment will differ from guest to guest in terms of guest profile and status. The guest can settle their bill by cash, credit card. Debit card, travel  agent  vouchers,  personal  cheque,  and  bill  to  company,  foreign currency, etc.

The above mentioned mode of bill settlement is generally followed in all luxury hotels, so that the cashier can prepare guest folio in advance. But it is  very  important  to  confirm  the  mode  of  bill  settlement  at  the  time  of guest check out also. Because even at the last minute the guest can change their mode of bill settlement, and the cashier should be able to handle such kind situations.

Receiving Payment From Guest: After the final preparation of guest bill, it is given to guest for reviews. Once the guest is satisfied about their bills receive the payment as per the pre-decided mode of payment. Any posting error should be shown to the cashier for necessary action by guest. In case of cash settlement check the currency notes and hand over the balance to guest. PAID STAMP seal is put on top of the guest copy of bill. Put the bills in hotel envelope and hand over to guest.

Marketing Activity Procedure During Check-Out: Since guest checkout is the final stage where guest come in contacts with front desk staff, the  hotel  staff  should  use  this  opportunity  for  marketing  efforts  for promoting hotel business.

The following marketing strategies may be followed:

-  Receptionist can politely enquire about guest experience at the hotel during their stay.
-  Guest  may  be  given  feedback/guest  comments  card  to fill up.

-  In case any guest complaints, assure the guest for taking action.
-  Providing service in terms of future reservation for the guest  trip  or  helping  the  guest  in  making  room reservation at the next destination of the guest.
-  Thank the guest for staying in the hotel.

Notify  all  other  departments  about  guest  departure: The  front  desk through  departure  notification  slips  (DNS)  informs  all  the  departments about the departure of the guest to ensure smooth operations of the hotel, therefore the point of sale will not offer any credit facility to the guest who have  already  settled  their  bills  and  politely  ask  for  direct  payment.  The housekeeping  department  once  get  the  information  about  checkout performs following things

-  Prepare the room for the next guest
-  Block the room for special cleaning processes
-  Look for maintenance requirement in the room
-  Refurnish the room for future sales

To ensure proper room management, both front office and housekeeping must coordinate and inform of the change in the room status

Updating Records after Guest Departure: Once the  guest  has  cleared his/her bills and checked out, the front office staff should update the hotel records especially the room status records for reselling of rooms. Different records which are updated after the guest check out are:

Room status record: As soon as the guest checkout the front desk updates the room status record, for this the front office removes the Name tag  slip  from  the  information  desk,  room  rack  so  that  the checkout rooms may be cleaned for next guest. If it is not followed the  room  will  be  vacant  and  dirty  and  it  cannot  be  given  to  any guest, which is loss to the hotel.

Guest  History  Card: Generally  most  hotels  maintain  Guest history  Card,  which    is   a  file  which  containing  all  relevant personnel information about guest details like his previous arrival and departure dates, type of room and rate charged,  guest Name, age, Designation, Company, Marital status, Salary, Likes, dislikes, Interest in sports, Music, choice of Food, Any Special habits etc. Front office Department plays a very important role in maintaining and updating guest history time to time. Generally in all hotels this type  of  data  maintained  to  know  about  their  guest  preference  in terms of providing great customer service by all hotel staff.

All these details are collected at the front desk and entered in the guest  computer  data.  This  file  provide  information  about  guest financial status, spending pattern, mode of bill settlement, previous

visit date, any complaints and suggestions given by guest. Having such information helps the hotel to provide better guest service.

## Benefits of Guest History Record:

-  It helps to know about their guest
-  It helps to promote business
-  It  helps  to  serve  guest  better  according  to  their  needs and choice
-  Better understanding with guest
-  To  wish  the  guest  on  birthdays,   Anniversaries, Festivals,
-  To  provide  professional  and  anticipated  service  to guests
-  Act as a bridge between the management and guest.
-  For any future reference of guest

## 3.8 METHODS OF SETTLEMENT

The hotel determines the mode of settlement t the time of registration or sometimes at the time of reservation .this makes it more convenient to prepare the front desk in terms of preparing the bills at the time of check out At the time of checkout the guest account is brought to a zero balance by receiving payment in several ways which includes foreign currency, travelers cheque, cash payment, credit card etc

FOREIGN  EXCHANGE: The  tourism  and  hospitality  industry  is  one  of  the  major foreign exchange earners for any nations in the world. All the foreign visitors in a hotel can settle in their currency of their country - Dollar, Pound etc except the guest who are employed with United National (UN) and its agencies, embassies, consulates, and high commission. Hotels have to take valid license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deal with foreign exchange.RBI issue two types of licenses - Sales License for the sale of foreign  currency&  Purchase  License  for  the  purchase  of  foreign  currency  .Generally hotels  have  purchase  license  which  means  hotel  can  only  purchase  foreign  currency  ie Hotel can accept foreign currency from the guest but cannot refund amount will only be made in Indian currency. If Hotel have both the license than they can buy and sell foreign currency i.e. can accept foreign currency and give balance amount in foreign currency.

## Procedure for accepting foreign currency:

-  The cashier requests the guest to produce his passport and check the credentials such  as  name  and  photo  identification  place  of  issue  and  date  of  expiry  of  the passport.
-  The cashier confirms that the guest is a resident of the hotel by asking his room number.  If  the  guest  is  a  non-resident  the  permission  of  the  lobby  manager  is obtained who will extend this facility to VIP's and regular guests.
-  Find  out  the  type  of  currency  to  be  exchanged  and  determine  whether  it  is exchangeable as per governor banking regulation and their exchange rates as per the day
-  Receive the cash or traveler's cheque in foreign currency.
-  Calculate the total amount of local currency to be paid by multiplying the foreign currency by the exchange rate displayed.
-  The cashier prepares the foreign currency encashment certificate.
-  Request the guest to sign the foreign currency encashment certificate and compare the signature with the passport.
-  Request the guest to sign the traveler's cheque if it is an instrument of exchange.
-  Give  the  total  amount  of  local  currency  with  the  original  copy  of  encashment certificate to the guest
-  Second  copy  of  the  certificate  is  attached  to  the  notes  or  traveler's  cheques received
-  Third copy remains in the encashment certificate book.
-  Fill in details in the records of foreign currency control sheet of foreign currency transactions.

SETTLEMENT IN CASH: The cash payment is one of the most preferred modes of settlement of guest accounts as it is very convenient for both hotel and guest. At the time of settlement, the cashier zeroes the balance in the guest account. A cash receipt is to be issued  to  the  guest  by  the  cashier  and/or  the  cashier  should  mark  the  folio  paid.  The various modes of settlement by cash are as follows:

Currency Notes: Guest can settle their account by paying through currency notes. This is one of  the  most  widely  accepted  mode  of  account  settlement  while  accepting  currency notes  the  cashier  should  check  if  the  currency  notes  are  genuine  or  not  the  procedure followed by cashier while accepting currency notes are:

-  If  accepting  foreign  currency  from  the  guest,  the  cashier  checks  the  daily conversion rate.
-  To avoid any confusion the cashier should retain the cash amount outside the cash drawer till the transaction is complete.
-  The cashier should count the value of the currency in front of the guest
-  If  accepting  foreign  currency  the  cashier  prepares  foreign  currency  encashment certificate
-  The cashier issues receipt for the transaction
-  As  per  government  rule  the  cashier  should  accept  foreign  currency  only  from foreigners and return the balance amount if any in local currency.

Traveler's  Cheque: It  is  an  internationally  accepted  cheque  for  a  sum  in  a  specific currency that can be exchanged elsewhere for local currency or goods. It is issued by a financial institution and functions as cash but is protected against loss or theft. It is useful especially in the case of overseas travel where all credit and debit cards are not accepted. As it is accepted all over the world so it is very famous mode of settlement across the world in terms of settling bills in hotels while travelling in foreign countries. The value of travellers' cheque is mentioned in it. Some bank charge for commission when we encash the cheque and some bank don't charge for it. A Traveller's cheque in short is called as TC. The purchaser of the traveller's cheque has to put two signatures - one in front of the issuing authority and second in front of the encashing authority. To prevent misuse the loss of traveller's cheque should be immediately reported to the issuing bank and local police authority.  While accepting a traveler's cheque from a guest the front desk cashier should proceed as follows:

-  Ensure that the second signature is put in front of the cashier
-  Check the guests passport to establish identity
-  Write the passport number behind the traveller's cheque
-  If  the  traveller's  cheque  is  in  foreign  currency,  then  calculate  the  correct exchange value as per the daily rate
-  The cashier must return the balance in local currency.

## Advantage of Travellers cheque:

-  The cheques are issued in fixed denominations by major banks, Travel agents.
-  No need of bank account for purchasing traveller's cheque
-  Two signatures are required one in the presence issuing authority at bank and second signature of guest at encashing authority (hotels)
-  These cheques are valid for indefinite period of time unless dated.

-  This type of cheque never bounces, since it is already paid by guest at bank.
-  Quite safe in carrying traveller's cheque.
-  In case of loss of traveller's cheque it should immediately reported to issuing bank and local police station.

Personal Cheques: Personal cheques are cheques drawn against funds deposited in the individual  personal  bank  account  and  it  takes  some  time  to  clear  from  the  bank  ie  to receive  payment  from  it  there  are  also  the  chances  of  bouncing  the  cheques  ie  bank refusing to make the payment if there is insufficient amount in the account or if the guest has stopped the cheque, hence it is normally not accepted mode of account settlement. however hotels may accept personal cheque from regular guest of the hotel and corporate companies that give high volume of business to the hotel. In case if any guest insist on settling  bill  through  personal  cheque  than  front  desk  should  first  take  the  authorization from the lobby manager, On receiving authorization than the guest is asked to submit an letter  for  making payment by personal cheque the cashier before receiving the personal cheque should check the following details :

-  The signature in the application form and the cheque must match
-  The cheque is crossed as A/c payee only
-  The amount in figures and words should be same.
-  The date on the cheque should be valid
-  Accept only MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Reader)cheques
-  Do not accept second or third party cheques

Demand Draft: Demand draft in a written order form which is issued by the bank for the payment of money for the person on whose name the draft is issued. The bank authorises to make the payment once it is presented to the bank. Any person can obtain a demand draft by filling the necessary documents prescribed by bank and paying the draft amount and the bank will charge some commission amount for preparing demand draft.

Debit Card: Debit card is also a mode of bill settlement generally accepted in all hotels. A debit card is a card made of plastic that allows the guest/customer to access their funds immediately, electronically. It enables the holder to withdraw money or to have the cost of  purchases  charged  directly  to  the  bank  account  without  paying  by  cash  or  writing  a cheque. While settling bills these cards are given to the cashier to swipe in the machine for deducting money directly from their saving account and the customer has to authorise the payment by pressing their PIN NO in the machine and the amount will be deducted from the customer account. In case of insufficient funds, the bank does not authorize the transaction and the guest is requested for an alternate mode of payment.

Credit Settlement: A credit settlement is a settlement in which the hotel does not receive any payment on the day of departure of the guest but would receive it later.

Credit Card/ Charge Card Payments: A credit card is a payment card generally  made  up  of  plastic  that  allows  the  owner  to  obtain  goods  and services on credit terms. It is a popular method of guest bill settlement for payment  as  Credit  cards  are  very  much  convenient  for  travellers:  they don't need to carry heavy cash or cheque book during their journey. As

credit cards are generally made up of plastic other name for credit card is plastic  money.  As  most  of  the  hotels  nowadays  use  electronic  machines linked  directly  to  the  bank,  card  details  are  collected  through  magnetic swiping  machine  for  appropriate  payments  and  mostly  hotels  accept  at least  one  or  two  major  credit  cards  for  example  Master  card,  American express,  Visa  card,  diners  club,  SBI  card,  ICICI,  etc.  A  charge  card  is similar to credit card is a plastic payment card that enables the holder to obtain  goods  and  services  without  the  requirement  to  pay  cash.  The account  settlement  is  sent  to  the  card  holder  every  month  and  must  be settled in full. Unlike the credit card the balance in the charge card account cannot be rolled over from one billing to the next. In addition for obtaining goods the charge card can be used to obtain cash few examples of charge card are American Express, Diners Club etc.

## How to Process Credit Card For Payment:

Most of the hotels entertain credit card payment because of the electronic machines  linked  by  telecommunication  links  directly  to  concerned  bank and all relevant information of card is collected when it is swiped in EDC MACHINE (ELECTRONIC DEVICE CIRCUIT).

It  is  amongst  the  most  favored  modes  of  account  settlement.  While processing a payment through credit card the front office cashier follows the following procedure:

-  Checks the card holder's name on the card
-  Checks the expiry date on the card
-  Checks if the card is a stolen card
-  Checks the credit limit of the card.
-  Swipes  the  card  through  EFTPOS  (Electronic  Fund  Transfer Point of Sale) terminal for verification and authorization from the issuer of the card and than enters bill amount and the hotels identification code.
-  Receives transaction slip from the machine which produces two charge slip
-  Asks the guest to sign on the transaction slip
-  Verifies the guest signature with the signature on the signature panel on the reverse of the card
-  Returns the credit card and a copy of the transaction slip to the guest
-  The other copy along with the guest signature is kept with the hotel for processing of payments from the bank.

Travel Agent Voucher : These  type of travel agent vouchers are issued by travel agents, and tour operators who sells package tour to a tourist in advance which includes  room  accommodation,  food  charges,  sightseeing,   transportation,  ticket fare etc. Travel agency voucher(TAV) indicates that the guest has already paid in advance to travel agency for making all necessary arrangements for a tour. Travel agents thus sends a copy of voucher to the hotel at the time of room booking with the details of the billing procedure (direct payment by the guest or bill to travel

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

agent), and second copy of the voucher is given to guest .At the time of check-in at hotel, guest submit the travel agent voucher at reception desk.

Most  of  the  voucher  includes  the  services  (room  and  fooding)to  be  offered  by hotel  to  guest  and  thus  guest  must  be  aware  about  the  services  included  in  the voucher and Any extra charges will be recovered from guest directly.

Apart from travel agencies and tour operators, airlines that have contract or tie up with  the  hotels  also  send  meal  and  accommodation  order(MAO)or  passenger service order(PSO)to layover passengers in case of flight delays and cancellation. In that case hotel obtains payment from airlines or the travel agents. Points should be kept in mind while handling Travel agent voucher for bill settlement:

-  Read the voucher carefully issued by travel agent
-  Refer  to  the  list  of  approved  travel  agents  to  whom  the  hotel  offers credit.
-  Check  the  billing  instruction  carefully  what  all  the  services  are included and what are the extra services to be paid directly by guest?
-  In case of a foreign travel agency voucher get authorization from the lobby manager.
-  Check the expenses which are covered under the voucher.
-  Collect  payments  from  the  guest  for  the  services  not  covered  or included in the voucher for eg bill of laundry or spa treatment.
-  Enclose all the bills signed by guest, with the master bill and request the guest to verify and sign the bill.
-  Do not hand over the original bills to guest as original bills has to be
-  Presented to travel agent which is going to make payment to hotel.

## 3.9.5   Front Office Accounting System

The front office accounting system is responsible for:

-  Creating  and  maintaining  an  accurate  accounting  record  for  each guest or non-guest in the hotel
-  Tracking all financial transactions throughout the guest cycle
-  Ensuring internal control over cash and non-cash transactions
-  Settlement of all guest accounts

The front office accounting system can be customized and tailored to meet each hotel's needs. Therefore, the hotels can have their own front office accounting systems. Though the General Concepts of Front Office Accounting is:

CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF GUEST ACCOUNTS: All  guest  folios  or account shall be created at the time of pre-arrival (reservation) or arrival (registration)stage of the guest cycle. As it is the responsibility of Front Office Cashier to record  all  transactions  that  affect  guest-ledger  and  non-guest  accounts  accurately  and completely  for  folio  creation,  the  necessary  information  is  taken  from  reservation  & registration  records,  for  pre-numbered  folios,  the  folio  number  is  entered  on  to  the registration card and vice-versa for cross-referencing.

-  Manually-/ machine-posted folios are stored in a front desk folio tray (also known as posting tray/folio well/ buckets).
-  Electronic Folios are automatically cross-referenced with other records within the system. This considerably reduces transactional accounting errors
-  As far as walk-ins are concerned, all their guest folios are created at the arrival stage.

Record keeping systems: Non- automated systems: Ensured through a series of columns  listing  individual  debit  and  credit  entries  accumulated  during  the occupancy stage after which and establishment of an ending outstanding balance is needed.

Semi-automated systems: Under this very system, all guest transactions should be printed sequentially on a machine-posted folio. Later, the front office  clerk  needs  to  come  up  with  the  folio  outstanding  balance.  It  is extremely  important  here  to  mention  that,  under  this  very  system,  each account's previous balance shall be re-entered each time a transaction is posted to the folio.

Fully-automated systems: All  guest  charges are automatically posted to an electronic folio

Guest charge privileges : The privilege  given to a guest to avail hotel facilities on credit basis.

-  A guest may be required to present an acceptable credit card or  a direct billing  authorization  at  the  time  of  registration  (  or  at  the  time  of reservation in fully automated hotels)
-  Guests are authorized to make charge purchases once a line of credit has been established (through Direct Billing Authorizations or Credit Cards).

Credit monitoring: In order to monitor and control charge privileges, the front office  clerk  should  check  whether  the  total  net  purchases  are  less  than  the minimum of floor Limit (i.e.:  credit  card  company's  limit)  and  house  limit  (i.e.

hotel's  limit).  At  least,  each  day,  lists  of  guests  with  high  risk  or  high  balance accounts  shall  be  communicated  to  all  point  of  sale  outlets.  This  is  vital  since, failing to do so, will let point of sales outlets continue giving charge privileges to a  point  that  eventually  the  credit  card  company  refuses  to  pay  the  amount  of money  exceeding  its  limit.  This  will  cause  very  serious  financial  losses  to  the hotel.  To  avoid  such  situation  front  office  cashier  and  night  auditor  in coordination works to check that:

As the guest approaches his credit limit, The night auditor who is primarily responsible for identifying accounts of all the guest which have reached or exceeded  predetermined  credit  limits,  prepares  a  high  balance  report mentioning  the  details  of  all  such  guest(in  detail  discussed  in  night auditing) for the management or front office who may need to be notified, according  to  hotel  policy.  Such  accounts  are  called  high  risk  or  high balance accounts.

Management  than  may  choose  to  request  additional  credit  authorization from the credit card company, or request a partial payment from the guest to reduce the accounts balance.

The front office may even deny charge purchase privileges to guest with high balance accounts until the situation is resolved.

## Account maintenance:

All  the  monetary  transactions  that  take  place  between  the  hotel  and  a  guest  are recorded in the guest folio in order of their occurrence an entry in the guest folio may be either debit or credit.

Net outstanding balance = Previous balance + Debits - Credits

NOB                      =            PB             +    DR  -   CR

Debit  entries  may  include -  room  charges,  food  and  beverage  charges telephone charges etc

Credit  entries  may  include -  prepayment  in  part  or  full  t  the  time  of reservation or registration, allowances given  to the guest, adjustments, full payment made at the time of settlement

TRACKING ALL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS : In accounting, a transaction is an exchange  of  goods  and  services  for  cash  or  a  promise  to  pay.  The  occurrence  of  a transaction  by  the  guest  initiates  activity  within  the  front  office  accounting  system. Nothing happens without a transaction. For this reason, the front office accounting system is called a transactional accounting system.

Both the nature of the transaction and its monetary value are required for proper posting procedures.  Charge  purchase  transactions  must  be  properly  documented  (typically  on vouchers) for appropriate postings to be made. These must be promptly communicated to the front office for posting in the guest folios. The night audit verifies all transactional data  to  ensure  that  the  hotel  collects  accounts  receivable  balances  for  all  goods  and services provided.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

Under the manual and semi-automated systems, tracking transactions is ensured through an intensive use of vouchers. On the other hand, Under fully automated systems, tracking transactions  is  ensured  through  on-line  electronic  transfer  of  transactional  information from remote points of sale to the front office main frame terminal.

A transaction can be one of several types:

-  Cash payment
-  Charge purchase
-  Account correction
-  Account allowance
-  Current transfer
-  Cash Advance

Cash payment: In this transaction, Cash payments made by guests at the front desk are posted as credits to a guest or non guest account, and decrease the balance of the account, and cash vouchers are used as a transaction-supporting document.

Charge  purchase: Charge  purchases  represent  deferred  payment  transactions.  In  a deferred payment transaction, the buyer receives goods and services but does not pay for them  at  the  time  they  are  provided  that  increase  the  outstanding  balance  of  a  folio account.  In  this  transaction  type,  front  office  clerks  shall  use  charge  vouchers  as  a transaction-supporting document.

Account  correction: Account  correction  is  used  to  resolve  a  posting  error  in  a  folio detected at the day the error is made (i.e. before the closing of the business day). In this transaction, front office  clerks shall use correction vouchers as a transaction-supporting document.

Account allowance: Account allowances occur because of two reasons:

- 1. Either as compensation of poor service, or as rebates for coupon discounts. That way, guest outstanding balance decreases.
- 2. As to correct a posting error detected after the closing of the business day.

For both reasons, front office clerks shall prepare an allowance voucher as a transaction supporting document.

Account Transfer: When any one guest offers to pay a charge for another guest, the charge must be transferred from one account to another account. The reduction in balance on the originating folio and the increase in balance on the destination folio will be supported by a transfer voucher.

Cash  advance/  Visitors  Paid  Out  (VPO): Cash  advances  differ  from  other transactions in that they reflect cash flow out of the hotel, either directly to or on behalf of a guest. Cash advance transactions are similar to debit transactions and increase a folio balance. Cash advances are supported by cash advance vouchers

.

INTERNAL CONTROL: In the hotel industry, the main purpose of internal control is:

-  Tracking transaction documents
-  Verifying accounts entries and balance

-  Identifying vulnerabilities/ weaknesses in an accounting system

The keyword to internal control is auditing, which is the process of verifying front office accounting records for accuracy and completeness. Each Financial transaction produces paperwork which documents the nature and amount of the money of the transaction.

For example, the transaction that occurs when a guest charges a meal to his or her account folio  may  be  supported  by  the  restaurant's  guest  check,  cash  register  tape,  and  charge purchase voucher. The voucher is prepared and sent to the front office as notification of the transaction. A front desk agent, in turn, retrieves the guest's folio, posts the charge purchase  transaction,  and  files  the  folio  and  voucher.  Later  that  day,  the  night  auditor ensures  that  all  vouchers  have  been  properly  posted  to  accounts  discrepancies  may  be easier  to  resolve  if  complete  documentation  is  readily  available  to  substantiate  account entries.

Below are some forms that are of extreme importance to internally control, one of the most vital assets in the hotel (i.e. cash):

Front  office  cash  sheet: The  front  office  is  responsible  for  a  variety  of  cash transaction,  which  may  affect  both  guest  and  non-guest  accounts  .proper  cash handling procedures and controls must be established, implemented, and enforced. The front office cash sheet records each cash receipt or disbursement in order to reconcile  cash  in  hand,  at  the  end  of  a  cashier's  shift,  with  the  documented transaction  that  occurred  during  the  same  shift.  It  provides  separate  columns  to record transactions affecting  guest  accounts,  non-guest  accounts(or  city  ledgers) and miscellaneous transactions

Cash  banks/  Imp  rest/  Cash  Float: A  second  set  of  front  office  accounting control procedure involves the use of cashier banks. Cash bank is an amount of cash assigned to a cashier so that he/ she can handle the various transactions that occur during the shift. At the beginning of each shift, all cashiers must sign their cash  banks  and  at  the  end  of  the  shift,  shall  deposit  all  cash,  checks,  and  other negotiable instruments in the general cashier's safe deposit box. Moreover, at the end  of  each  shift,  cashiers  should  watch  out  for  cash  discrepancies  (i.e.  any difference  between  front  office  cash  sheet  and  the  actual  amounts  in  their  cash drawers). Cash discrepancies might have the form of cash overages, shortages, or due backs. Lastly, cashiers might come up with the net cash receipt, which is:

Amount of all cash, checks, and other negotiable instruments in cashier's drawer - amount of the initial cash bank + all paid outs

Audit control: A  number of  audit  control  measures  are  used  to  ensure  that  the front office staff properly handles cash, guest accounts, and non-guest accounts. Therefore most of the hotels have internal audit as well as external annual audits performed by independent certified public accountants. This is done to ensure that all  accounts  are  being  properly handled by the staff concerned.  In both  cases,  a report is prepared and completed for management and ownership for their review.

SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS: One of the responsibilities of front office clerks is to settle  guest  accounts,  which  means  the  eventual  collection  of  payment  for  outstanding

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

account balances i.e.: bringing account balances to 0 All guest accounts must be settled at the time of checkout and this is usually ensured either by full cash payment, or by transfer to  an  approved  credit  card,  personal  check,  special  program,  or  direct  billing  account. This is  the  final  and  concluding  phase  of  the  front  office  accounting  cycle;  it  refers  to zeroing the balance of the guest folio to settle their account. The formula for calculating outstanding balance is:

Outstanding amount =opening balance +debit entries-credit entries

## 3.10 Night Audit

Auditing  is  nothing  but  conducting  financial  inspection  of  the  organization.  It  is performed to ensure accuracy, reliability & thoroughness of accounting system. As Hotels operate 24x7x365 so Front Office regularly reviews and verifies the accounts. Because the  guest  staying  in  the  hotel  include  regular  guest  or  occasional  guest  and  there  is duration of stay may vary from few hours to several weeks, and a transaction especially financial one should be reviewed on daily basis guest might depart from the hotel anytime and it may be too late to recover an unpaid bill or loss due to is take in posting the charges in the guest account thus in order to safe guard the interest of the hotel, a systematic and daily examination of the financial transaction of the guest is carried out by the hotel. Thus Auditing  in  hotel  results  in  balanced  guest  &  non-guest  accounts,  accurate  account statements, credit monitoring and reports generation. It is generally done during night that is  why  it  is  called  as  night  auditing  and  person  responsible  for  doing  it  is  called  night auditor.

Definition: According  to  the  oxford's;  learner's  dictionary  audit  is  an  official examination of business and financial records to check that they are true and correct. The night  audit  is  a  daily  review  of  guest  accounts  and  non-guest  accounts  having  activity, against  revenue  centre  transaction  information  which  helps  guarantee  accuracy  in  front office  accounting.  It  is  the  process  of  auditing  where  the  night  auditor  reviews  all financial activities of the Hotel that has taken place in one day. A successful audit will result  in  balanced  accounts,  accurate  statements,  and  appropriate  credit  monitoring  and timely reports to management. Since hotels operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, it is important to review and verify the accuracy and completeness of its accounting records. Whatever the mode of audit the audit routine would remain relatively unchanged.  The audit is called a night audit because hotels generally perform it at night.

Why it is called as Night Audit? In most of the business An audit is generally carried out at the end of the every financial years and as hotel operates for 365 days following 24X7 pattern it become compulsory to safeguard the loss of revenue that may occur due to any error in the posting of charges in folios a daily auditing was required in the hotel and as in olden days, manual system was followed it was found night time was the most appropriate period for auditing due to very little business and movement during the night i.e. traffic of guest was less in the night and besides that all the posting will be done till the night so night was the most suitable time to review and check all the posting done throughout the day, therefore auditing was done in night and thereby it is called as night auditing.

It  is  called Night Audit because it is performed at Night. In olden days, manual system was followed and For a hotel business, the finance management starts at the front office. Accurate  posting  of  transactions  on  the  guest  folios  start  at  the  front  office,  which  is further  carried  to  the  back-office  accounting  department.  The  guest  accounts  are counterchecked  on  a  daily  basis  during  auditing.  Experts  recommend  the  hotel management team to go through the night audit reports daily to get an insight of the hotel occupancy and finances.

The  Need  for  Night  Audit: The  objective  of  night  audit  is  to  evaluate  the  hotel's financial activities. Night audit not only reviews guest accounts by checking credits and debits but also tracks the credit limits of the guests and tallies projected and actual sales from various departments. Night audit reviews daily cash flow into and out of the hotel's account.  Night  audit  has  a  large  significance  in  hotel  business  operations.  The management body refers night audit report to plan future goals and control the expenses.

The managers can react immediately on the acquired information.

-  Responsibilities of a Night Auditor
-  Basic Activities During Night Audit
-  The night auditor performs the following steps during night audit activity:
-  Posting accommodation and tax charges
-  Accumulating guest service charges and payments
-  Settling financial activities of various departments
-  Settling the account receivables
-  Running the trial balance for the day
-  Preparing the night audit report

Apart  from  the  basic  audit  activities  listed  above,  the  night  auditor  carries  out  the following Functions:

-  Establishes the end of day.
-  Ensures accuracy of Front Office accounting records and balances them
-  Reconciles all financial transactions between hotel and guests.
-  Calculates the total revenue generated during the day.
-  Verifies and validates the cashier's posting of charges in guest accounts.
-  Posts room charges in the guest folios.
-  Transfers unpaid guest accounts to city ledger.
-  Monitors the house limits of guests.
-  Prepares a high balance report of guest accounts nearing or crossing their house limit.
-  Monitors  current  status  of  discounts,  meal  coupons  and  other  promotional activities that are carried out by front office employees.
-  Tracks important operating statistics of the hotel for the day- room occupancy %, ARR, Rev PAR, Yield, etc.
-  Prepares reports for management analysis and action and future planning.

## NIGHT AUDIT PROCESS : It includes following steps:

-  Establishes the end of the day

-  Complete outstanding postings and verifying transactions
-  Reconciling Transactions
-  Reconciling Room Status Discrepancies
-  Verify no-show reservations
-  Post room rate and tax
-  Preparing reports

Establishes the end of the day: An end of day is an arbitrary stopping point for the business day i.e. it is supposed to be the end of the financial transaction for a particular day. As hotel remain operational 24x7x365 is very necessary that there should be a time fixed at which all the financial transaction for that day comes to an  end.  In  hotels  this  time  is  usually  the  hours  at  which  the  least  number  of transactions would occur and which is in the night shift that is why the auditing in hotel is done during night.

Complete  outstanding  postings  and  verifying  transactions: Night  auditor ensures proper posting of all transactions affecting non-guest and guest accounts. Transactions are supposed to be posted to accounts as they are received and he has to  ensure  that  all  vouchers  are  posted.  Further  he  has  to  verify  (even  in computerized  system)  the  postings.  This  he  does  by  matching  reports  from interfaces with reports from Front Office system in a computerized environment.

Reconciling  Transactions: The  next  step  is  there  reconciliation  of  the  entire financial  transaction  taken  place  throughout  the  day  with  the  original  source documents/vouchers.  There reconciliation is done in the following sections:

-  Guest accounts
-  City accounts
-  Point of sales

Reconciling  Room  Status  Discrepancies:  Room  status  discrepancies  must  be resolved in a timely manner. Such errors can lead to lost revenue and omissions in postings. The front office must keep room status current and accurate to monitor the  number  of  rooms  available  for  sale.  The  night  auditor  is  responsible  for ensuring that discrepancies between the daily housekeeping report and the front office  room  status  are  reconciled  before  the  end  of  the  day.  If  the  front  office believes a guestroom is occupied, but it is reported as vacant on the housekeeping report,  the  auditor  should  look  for  an  active  folio  (folio  with  a  balance outstanding)  If the folio has a balance, possibilities are:

-  The guest may have departed but has forgotten to check out
-  The guest may be a skipper
-  The front desk agent may not have closed the folio

Verify no-show reservations: The night auditor also verifies no show. A no show is  a  situation  when  a  guest  with  a  confirmed  reservation  does  not  arrive  at  the hotel on the date of arrival without any prior information about the cancellation The  night  auditor  is  responsible  for  verifying  all  the  no  shows,  clearing  the reservation  rack  and  posting  no  show  charges  or  retention  charges  to  no-show

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

accounts after confirming that the reservation was guaranteed and the guest never arrived. A hotel should take great care to record cancellations properly and should be very sure before posting retention charges as There might be a regular guest / Corporate  etc.  and  sometimes  A  cancellation  might  not  have  been  recorded. Therefore night auditor should be very careful before posting to avoid charging a guest for no-show charges when not applicable.

Post room rate and tax: The posting of room rates and tax to all guest folios is typically  done  at  the  end  of  day.  Direct  posting  of  these  to  the  electronic  room folios in a computerized system is one of the greatest advantages of a PMS. After such posting, a Room Rate and Tax Report may be made sfor the management.

Preparing reports: The next step is that auditor is responsible for preparation of various  reports  for  managerial  use  which  helps  them  manage  entire  view  the profitability of the hotel operations and to plan for future. In manual system this is one of the typical task but in fully automated hotel these reports are automatically prepared by the system. The reports prepared are

-  High Balance Report
-  Occupancy reports

High Balance Report: The High Balance Report identifies guests who are approaching  an  account  credit  limit.  This  is  a  detailed  report  about  the guests  either  resident  guest  or  city  account  who  are  approaching  or exceeded the credit limit set by  the hotel management. the night auditor checks all the accounts against the credit limit or the house limits set by the hotel and a high balance report is prepared in case any guest account reaches or crosses the house limit.

Occupancy  reports: The  night  auditor  also  generates  the  following occupancy reports:

-  Occupancy percentage
-  House count
-  Bed Occupancy Percentage
-  Domestic Occupancy Percentage
-  Foreigner's Occupancy Percentage

Occupancy Percentage: This is the ratio of the number of rooms sold to the total saleable rooms. It helps in determining the level of revenue that will be generated by the hotel and is indicator of the performance of the hotel.

𝑶𝒄𝒄𝒖𝒑𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒚 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 = 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒏𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒔𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔

House Count : The house count is the total number of resident guests present in the  hotel  ie  the  total  number  of  rooms  sold.  It  is  used  to  determine  the  average room rate per person.

House count = house count of previous day brought forward - today's departure's + today's arrivals

Bed occupancy percentage: It is the ratio of the number of beds occupied to the total number of available beds in the property

## 3.11  Summary

There are four stages of guest cycle followed by account settlement which is taken care by  account  department  in  coordination  with  front  office  as  the  maximum  revenue  is generated from front office. The four stages of guest cycle are: pre arrival, arrival, stay and departure. each guest coming to the hotel has to go through the same procedure as they proceed from reservation to arrival and allotment of rooms to their stay in the hotel, to the settlement of bill and departure from the hotel.

Pre arrival is the stage where guest books the room for himself in advance also called as reservation, as more and more people are travelling these days so to have comfortable and secure stay guest now pre book their room before visiting the destination, this helps the hotel in planning for future in terms of revenue, occupancy and man power requirement. Hotels can receive reservation request from different modes- verbal and oral and through different sources like the travel agencies, direct guest, corporate, but now days with the advancement of technology the most accepted source of reservation is CRS &GDS. the reservation made by the guest can be tentative, confirmed or waitlisted. In either of the type  of  reservation  request  received  the  standard  procedure  of  responding  is  to  first

receive  the  guest  reservation  inquires,  then  checking  the  room  availability  and  then accepting or denying the request.

Generally hotels do the overbooking so as to reduce the losses caused due to no shows, under stays etc, overbooking means booking more rooms than available in hotel. These stage of guest cycle is arrival- in which the registration activities are carried out to check in the guest, registration is mandatory for all the hotels to keep the details or records of all the guest staying in the hotel i.e. it act as a valid contract between hotel and the guest, the activities that are carried out just before the arrival of the guest for the efficient, smooth and  speedy  check  in  of  the  guest  is  known  as  preregistration,  To  maintain  registration records hotel either uses bound book , loose leaf, or Guest registration card GRC. The registration  process  involves  the  identification  of  guest  status,  preparing  registration records, room and rate assignments, establishing mode of settlement and finally allotting the room and issuing the keys there by completing the check in procedure.

The third stage of guest cycle is the stay- in this the major role is played by F& B Service and housekeeping department in terms of room service and room cleaning for the guest, front  office  is  only  concerned  with  providing  guest  services  like  handling  mails  and messages in absence of the guest, proving wakeup call on the request of the guest, paging the guest inside the premises of the hotel, providing safety deposit lockers if required by the guest, All these services contribute to guest satisfaction which ensures repeat business and positive mouth publicity by the guest . The fourth and the last stage of guest cycle is the departure stage and settlement of guest accounts. An efficient, speedy and error free billing leads to leaving a lasting impression in the minds of the guest.

## 4.1 Introduction

The  budget  is  a  vital  part  of  planning  and  controlling  as  it  represents  a  significant mechanism  for  performance  evaluation  of  the  organisation.  The  budget  is  a  document prepared to assess income and expenditure over a time period usually the previous year and altered to accommodate any predictable variations. In universal terms, a budget is an assessment of the income and expenses over a specified future period of time.

A  budget  can  be  made  for  anyone  -person,  family,  and  group  of  people,  business, government, country, multinational organization or for any thing that makes and spends money. As budget helps people to vigilantly look at how much money they are taking in

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

during a given period, and work out the best way to divide it among various categories. When  making  a  personal  budget,  an  individual  will  normally  assign  the  appropriate amount of money to fixed expenses such as rent, car payments, or utility bills, and then make an educated estimation for how much money they will spend in other categories, such as groceries, clothing, or entertainment. While in organization business will assign the money for cost of production ‗labour cost ‗overhead cost etc.

Batty explained that the entire process of preparing the budget is known as budgeting. Therefore the term budgeting refers to the act of preparing budget (Bhattacharyya, 2011). Whereas  budgetary  control  is  the  monetary  control  of  organisation  through  budgets  ie budgetary  control  is  the  perpetual  comparison  of  budgeted  figures  to  actually  achieved figures  of  the  business  for  the  specific  period  for  which  the  budget  was  prepared.  The word yield means to produce or give organisation an output or return and the term yield management  means  output  management.  In  terms  hotel  industry  the  term  means  the management of revenue generation from   rooms etc. In other words it act as a yardstick of performance of the establishment in terms of achieving maximum occupancy ie to be fully sold out that too at optimum revenue generation making the very best use of product is known as yield management.

## 4.2 Budget - Concept of budget

A budget is a plan and a budget document is a manifestation of the organisation actions in future. While any plan need not be a budget, a budget has to be necessarily a plan. . More  explicitly,  a  budget  contains  information  about  plans,  programmes,  projects, schemes  and  activities-current  as  well  as  new  proposals  for  the  coming  year,  resource position  and  income  from  different  sources,  actual  receipts  and  expenditure  for  the previous  year;  and  economic,  statistical  and  accounting  data  regarding  financial  and physical performance of the organisation.

Many persons,  corporations  and  governments  plan  their  financial  actions  by  preparing budgets.  In  order  to  get  huge  success  in  business  area,  an  organization  must  plan  its financial  activities  well  in  advance.  It  must  assess  its  income  and  expenditures  using historical data of activities in the past and predict future trends. The budget as explained by numerous experts is not just a financial plan that sets forth cost and revenue goals but it is an  effective  tool  for  planning  for  future,  for  controlling,  synchronization, communication, enthusiasm and performance measurement. In the organisation one of the most  important  aspects  of  management  is  control.  The  control  is  derived  from  two categories as:

Traditional  approach -  includes  break  even  analysis,  standard  costing,  rate analysis, internal audit, budgets etc.

Modern  control  approach -  includes  PERT  (programme  evaluation  review technique),CPM (critical path method) or  time network an analysis or (operation research)though all these methods are being used, still budgeting remains one of the most important techniques of control.

With reference to  hotels  an  annual  budget  is  a  profit  plan  which  addresses  all  revenue sources and expanses items, Hotels prepare annual budgets to help the management team

operate  the  hotel  more  efficiently.  Success  in  the  hotel  business  requires  careful management of expenses, particularly labor cost. Hotels have a relatively large staff. It is important to have sufficient human resources on property to deliver excellent customer service but not be overstaffed, which can reduce the hotel's profitability.

## 4.2.1  Definition of Budget

From above discussion it is clear that Budget: -A budget is a plan which projects both the revenues that hotel anticipates during the period covered by the budget and the expenses required generating the anticipated revenues‖. or can also be defined as "A plan by which resources are required to generate revenue is recorded." or According to Terry -Budget is an estimate of future needs arranged according to an orderly basis covering some or all other activities of an enterprises for a definite period of time‖.

According to CIMA, London a budget is a financial and quantitative statement prepared and approved prior to a defined period of time of policy to be pursued during that period for  the  purpose  of  attaining  a  given  objective.  Budget  is  an  estimate  of  government revenue and expenditure for the forthcoming fiscal year. Budget is a plan to be followed of how money will be spent over a period of time in relation to the money available and for  the  purpose  of  attaining  determined  goals.  In  other  words,  budget  refers  to  a  plan covering all the sectors of operations expressed in monetary or quantitative terms for a definite future period (Bhattacharyya, 2011).

Attributes of budget: A budget must have following features (Bhattacharyya, 2011):

-  It  should  reflect  the  managerial  plans  and  policies  to  accomplish  business  goals and objectives.
-  It must be expressed in monetary or quantitative terms or both.
-  It is comprehensive plan for definite future period.
-  Though  it  is  basically  an  instrument  of  planning,  it  still  provides  the  basis  for performance evaluation.

## Importance of Budgeting:

-  It lays the parameters of how much expenditure is permitted for various items    of cost.
-  The  efficiency  of  the  department  is  reflected  in  the  way  it  remains  within  the range of the budget.
-  It helps in focusing on priorities of expenditure.
-  Acts as an inbuilt control on activities.

## 4.2.2  Classification of Budgets

Budget  is  generally  categorized  on  the  basis  of  the  need  of  respective  organization. Preparation of budget may be required by organization for the purpose of its flexibility of production or its functions involved or for the purpose of its period covered. It includes:

Classification of budget on the basis of period: On the basis of period, or time covered in budget, it is grouped into short term and long term budget. Long term budget: When budget is prepared for business activity covering a period of more than one year, it is called long term budget. When budget is prepared for business

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

activity  covering  a  period  of  one  year  or  less,  it  is  termed  as  short  term  budget such as for sales, cash.

Classification  of  budget  on  the  basis  of  flexibility  of  production: In  this category,  budget  is  classified  into  three  parts  that  include  fixed,  flexible  and current  budget.  Fixed  budget  is  prepared  for  particular  level  of  production. Flexible budget include series of budgets prepared in respect of different levels of activity during a budget period. Current budget is associated with current business activities  of  a  concern  and  is  prepared  under  current  condition  for  a  very  short period.

Categorization  by  Department  Involved: Based  on  departmental  involved, budget may be categorized into: Master Budget and Departmental Budget. Master Budget: These represent the forecasted targets set for the whole organization and incorporate all income  and  expenditure  estimated  for  the  organization. Departmental  Budget:  Each  department  of  the  hotel  forwards  a  budget  for  its estimated  expenses  and  revenue  to  the  financial  controller.  For  instance  there would be front office budget etc.

## Classification of budget on the basis of purpose: It includes:-

Production  budget -  an  estimate  of  the  number  of  units  that  must  be manufactured to meet the sales goals.

Production  cost  budget -  details  the  estimated  cost  of  carrying  out production as per the production budget. It includes three main elementsmaterial, labour and overheads.

Purchase  budget -its  how  the  purchase  to  be  made  during  the  budget period, eg deals with the purchase of all direct and indirect material require for running the business.

Sales budget - this means an estimate of minimum future sales required to produce operating profit with respect to trading period. It is used to create company sales goals.

Capital budget -  used  to  determine  whether  an  organization's  long term investments such as new machinery, replacement machinery, new plants, new products, and research development projects are worth pursuing.

Cash  flow/cash  budget -  a  prediction  of  future  cash  receipts  and expenditures for a particular time period. It usually covers a period in the short term future. The cash flow budget helps the business determine when income will be sufficient to cover expenses and when the company will need to seek outside financing.

Marketing  budget -  an  estimate  of  the  funds  needed  for  promotion, advertising, and public relations in order to market the product or service.

Project  budget -  a  prediction  of  the  costs  associated  with  a  particular company project. These costs include labour, materials, and other related expenses. The project budget is often broken down into specific tasks, with task budgets assigned to each. A cost estimate is used to establish a project budget.

Revenue  budget -  consists  of  revenue  receipts  of  government  and  the expenditure met from these revenues. Tax revenues are made up of taxes and other duties that the government levies.

Expenditure budget - includes spending data items.

Classification of budget on the basis of Type of Expenditure: Based  on  the  type  of expense and assets involved, budget may be categorized into:

-  Capital Budget
-  Operating Budget
-  Pre-opening Budget

Capital  Budget: These  allocate  the  use  of  capital  assets  that  life  span considerably in access of one year; these are assets that are not normally used up in day to day operation. Example: furniture and fixture.

Operating  Budget : Operating  expenditures  are  those  costs  that  are incurred in order to generate revenue in normal course of doing business. The cost of all non recycled inventory items, such as cleaning and guest supply is also operation cost.

## 4.2.3 Capital and Operational Budget for Front Office

Front  office  is  one  of  the  major  revenue  producing  departments  of  the  hotel  and  is responsible  for  guest  satisfaction.  This  department's  efficient  and  profitable  operations affect the overall profitability of the hotel, as it is very much clear that about 70% or even more revenue is generated from front office so it becomes very much essential to make a more conscious budget for this department keeping in view all the aspects of the hotel. When we talk about front office budgeting it includes budgets from different sections of front office which includes reservation, bell desk and lobby etc individually, that means a front office manager will get individual budget from each of these sections, which when combine together by FOM, than on that basis he prepares a departmental master budget of front office.

Front Office Budgets may be divided into two basic classes: Capital Budgets & Operating Budgets. Capital budgets are directed towards proposed expenditure for new projects & often  require  special  financing.  The  operating  budgets  are  directed  towards  achieving

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

short term operational goals of the organization, for instance, production or profit goals in a business firm. Let us say that reservation section will give its budget which will mean the budgeted figures of reservation for a specific period of time. This budget shall also include  the  cost  of  reservation  system  that  is  to  say  the  cost  to  be  incurred  on  various equipments and stationary used in the system. For eg reservation rack, their replacement, were and tear's etc also the cost incurred on stationary, similarly it is on computer system then the cost incurred on maintenance and repairs of computer hardware and if the need be  of  the  procurement  of  new  machine  which  may  be  for  adding  on  to  the  present infrastructure  or  replacing  of  old  one  with  the  new  one.  similarly  other  equipment  like more filing racks for the section, more telephone lines and other such equipments which may be necessary for the efficient functioning  these action and ultimately in achieving the budget or targeted figures.

Further  the  reservation  budget  shall  also  include  the  budgeted  figure  of  labour  which mean number of staff required in future for the specific period for which budget is being made and also include labour cost and labour related cost for that period. This budget will be  prepared  by  reservation  manager.  This  type  of  budget  prepared  by  FOM    which includes  the  budget  for  all  those  items  which  are  required  for  daily  functioning  of  the department is classified under operating budget ie the operational budget includes budget for all those items that are required for efficient and smooth functioning of the front office on daily basis.

Whereas Capital Budget makes provision for all items of capital expenditure. It takes into account all items, which are guaranteed to have a life span of a number of years ie It is an intentional  expenditure  by  the  organisation  on  the  assets  that  are  not  used  up  in  the normal course of operations; instead they have a life span that exceeds a single year. As Capital  expenditure  involves  large  sums  on  such  investments  that  have  a  long  term impact. It is thus natural that decisions on these items are critical and should be made by General Manager, Financial controller and Front Office Manager altogether. Besides that it  is  very  important  to  keep  records  of  purchases  and  repairs  as  a  form  of  control.  A decision may have to be taken at some stage as to what it is more beneficial- to have a piece of equipment repaired or to simply buy a new one.

Having  received  a  decision  from  management  on  capital  expenditure  the  FOM  should observe the following steps:

-  Identification  of  supplier,  receiving  the  competitive  quotations,  selection  of  a supplier and finally purchase of the product taking into all consideration ie freight and transport, and handling charges.

The types of items, which are provided for in the capital budget, are as follows:

-  Large equipment and machinery.
-  Fixtures and fittings of front office.
-  Uniforms.
-  Special projects
-  Miscellaneous. It is quite normal to have a certain amount of money allocated for such a heading in order to make provision for emergencies, problems that could not have been foreseen, alterations required by law etc.

Some of the common items of front office which involve capital expenditure are

Tele-communication equipment eg EPBAX, telephone equipment with special features, computers, new and improved  software for front office department, billing machines, self service  terminals  etc.  Finally  on  the  basis  of  sub  section  budgets  including  both Operational and Capital budget, received from all the sub sections of front office, front office manager prepares a front office departmental master budget.

## 4.2.4   Refining Front Office Budget Plans

Once  the  budget  has  been  approved  and  given  for  implementation  ,it  is  the  duty  of management  to  ensure  that  employees  follow  the  budget  and  any  deviation  must  be observed,  recorded  and  notified,  the  reason  for  deviation  must  be  found  and  analyzed, thus from time to time refining of the budget should be done by FOM.

Once  the  budget  has  been  approved  and  given  for  implementation  ,it  is  the  duty  of management  to  ensure  that  employees  follow  the  budget  and  any  deviation  must  be observed,  recorded  and  notified,  the  reason  for  deviation  must  be  found  and  analyzed, thus from time to time refining of the budget should be done by FOM.

The  term  refining  budget  can  also  be  called  as  amending  the  budget  or  adjusting  the budget  or  modifying  the  budget,  ie  it  means  to  bring  changes,  which  may  be  either increasing or decreasing the figures of the already prepared forecasted figures, budget as already mention is a forecast or projection of figures for future and is based on certain assumption either from past records of from the expected future activities. Now since the future is indefinite so whatever base we might have taken for future may occur or may not occur  completely  or  partially  as  per  our  planning,  and  hence  when  it  comes  to  actual stage,  the  actual  figures  may  match  -  may  be  more  or  may  be  less  than  the  projected figures.  Like  for  eg  we  have  budgeted  a  sale  of  Rs1,00,00,000over  a  period  of  three months which meansapproxRs33,33,333 shall be earned every month by the hotel, now at the  end  of  every  month  we  are  required  to  check  whether  we  are  able  to  achieve  the targeted figure or not, and, if in actual also we are meeting the target than our forecasted targeted  sale  was  right  but  if  there  is  lot  of  difference  which  may  be  both  positive  or negative then it means our initial planning was wrong. Such variances have to be studied and analyzed immediately and corrective action should be taken which means based on new circumstances, new targeted figures are to be calculated. Furthermore let us suppose hotel has projected arrival of around10, 000 foreign tourist in the first quarter of financial year,  but  due  to  certain  problem  in  the  country  like  unstable  government,  increased terrorist activities, broke down of epidemics, the projected figure drop down from 10,000 to  5000  only,  thus  in  such  situation  re-  forecasting  is  normally  suggested  when  actual operating  results  begin  to  change  significantly  from  the  original  budget.  This  is  only possible  when  operational  results  are  reviewed  from  time  to  time.  Thereby  refining  of budget  is  very  important  activity  it  protects  the  establishment  from  heavy  losses.  The refining of the budget must be done by the same person who has initially prepared the budget, but he must be furnished with facts and figures.

## 4.2.5   Budgeting For Operations

The most important long terms planning function that front office performs is budgeting front office operations.  The hotels annual budget is a profit plan that covers all revenue sources and expenses items.  Annual budgets are commonly divided into monthly plans

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

that, is terms are divided into weekly etc plans.  These budget plans act as the standards against  which  management  can  evaluate  the  actual  results  of  operations.  In  general, revenue  generated  from  room  is  always  greater  than  food  &  beverage,  or  any  other revenue  generating  department  of  the  hotel. Therefore,  an  accurate  room's  division budget is vital in creating the overall budget of the hotel.

The  budget  planning  process  requires  the  effective  coordination  of  all  management personnel.  While the front office manager is responsible for room revenue forecast.  The accounting  division  staff  will  be  responsible  to  supply  department  managers  with statistical  information  process.   The  front  office  manager's  primary  responsibility  in budget  planning  are  forecasting  room  revenue  and  estimating  related  expenses.   Room revenue  is  forecasted  with  input  from  the  reservations  manager's,  while  expenses  are estimated with input from all department managers in the rooms divisions.

## 4.2.6   Forecasting Rooms Revenue

- To  forecast  room  revenue,  historical  financial  information  or  the  past  financial information serves as the foundation for the front office managers to do the forecast. This implies  that  one  method  of  rooms  revenue  forecasting  involves  an  analysis  of  room's revenue of past years. This means that reservation manager must provides the front office manger the data or figures of room revenue of past. Another way of revenue projection is on the basis of past room sales and average daily rates.

Forecasted Rooms Revenue = Rooms Available x Occupancy % x Average Daily Rate To understand the two approaches let us suppose: For example the table shows  yearly increases  in  net  rooms  revenue  for  the  Jason  Hotel.   For  the  years  2001  to  2004,  the amount of rooms revenue increased from Rs 1,000,000 to Rs 1,331,000, reflecting a 10 percent  yearly  increase.   If  future  conditions  appear  to  be  similar  to  those  the  past,  the rooms revenue for 2005 would be budgeted at Rs1,464,100 a 10 percent increase over the 2004 amount.

Rooms Revenue Summary for the Hotel ABC

|   YEAR | ROOMS REVENUE  Increase   | every year   | 10%   |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------|-------|
|   2001 | Rs1,000,000               | -            |       |
|   2002 | Rs1,100,000               | $1,00,000    |       |
|   2003 | $1,210,000                | $1,10,000    |       |
|   2004 | $1,331,000                | $1,21,000    |       |

## 4.2.7 Estimating Expenses

In hotel industry one of the major departments is Front office and most expenses of front office  operations  are  direct  expenses  in  nature  that  is  they  vary  in  direct  proportion  to rooms revenue which means more the revenue, more the expenses, and less the revenue, lesser the expenses. By using the data, we can calculate approximately the percentage of room revenue in relation to other direct room division expenses.

Typical  rooms  division  expenses  are  patrol  and  related  expenses,  guestroom  laundry (linen  included),  guest  supplies  (bath  amenities,  toilet  tissue),  hotel  merchandising  (inroom  guest  directory  and  promotional  brochures),  travel  agent  commission  and  direct reservation expenses, and other expenses.  When these costs are totaled and divided by the number of occupied rooms, the cost per occupied room is determined.

## 4.2.8  What is Budgetary Control

Welsch  has  defined  budgetary  control  as  -the  use  of  budgets  and  budgeting  reports throughout  the  period  to  coordinate,  evaluate  and  control  day-to-day  operations  in accordance  with  the  goals  specified  by  the  budget.‖  According  to  H.S.  Wheldon,  -By budgetary control, every items of actual cost is so controlled by vigilant supervision as to make it conform, as nearly as possible, to the predetermined standards. It has resulted in the  elimination  of  waste  and  excess  costs  in  every  suitable  instance  where  budgetary control has been properly instituted.‖ According to John Blocker, -Budgetary control is planned to assist the management the allocation of responsibilities and authority, to aid in making estimates and plans for future, to assist in analysis of various between estimated and  actual  results  and  to  develop  basis  of  measurement  or  standards  with  which  to evaluate the efficiency of operations.‖

In other words, the budgetary control device in the organisation encompasses practically the whole range of management activities right from planning and policy formulation to the final function of control over various activities of the manufacturing enterprise.

Budgetary control is a useful management control device. As the name suggests is the financial  control  through  budgets  which  means  fixing  the  responsibility  for  budgeted result to the managers concerned for eg fixing responsibility on front office manager for promoting results and meeting the targeted and budgeted figures of sales, cost and staff etc.  It  act  as  a  control  technique  as  it  provides  a  standard  for  evaluation  of  actual performance. Hence when we speak about budgetary control we mean the responsibilities that we assign to manager's usually expressed in terms of items such as sales target, profit margins, etc hence budgetary control is the technique to check what is being done and comparing  actual  result  with  the  standard  budgeted  data  in  order  to  approve accomplishments  or  to  remedy  differences  by  either  adjusting  the  budget  estimates  or correcting  the  cause  of  differences  where  there  is  budgetary  control  in  the  operation, current  operating  result  are  continually  viewed  and  analyzed  on  weekly,  monthly  or quarterly  basis  or  any  other  period  depending  upon  the  profile  of  the  policy  of  the business. The most important aspect of budgetary control is the planning which goes into the making of budget and its effectiveness in the control of hotel operation.

How budgetary control is applied: Budgetary control is required to achieve the goals and  objectives  of  the  hotel.  For  this  it  is  important  to  follow  the  course  of  action  that would help to achieve the targeted budget. when the manager find that there is deviations in actual from the budgeted targets he must immediately find the cause for it and quickly decide and implement the corrective action to set those deviations right.

Objectives of Budgetary Control: The main purpose of budgetary control is to enable the management to conduct the business in the most efficient manner in the organisation. Budgetary control has the following specific objectives:

-  Planning: Budgets are the plans to be followed during the designed period of  time  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  organization.  Budgetary  control will force the management at all levels to follow and plan various activities well in advance so as to achieve those objectives.
-  Policy making: Budgets are generally prepared on the basis of forecasts made about market forces, supply conditions and consumer's preferences in the organization. This help in making and revising business policies in the organization.
-  Control: Budgetary  control  is  an  important  instrument  of  managerial control  in  any  organization.  Budgetary  control  helps  in  comparing  the performance of various individuals and departments with the predetermined  standards  laid  down  in  various  budgets  and  as  separate budgets are prepared for each department it becomes easier to determine the weak points and the sources of waste of time, money and resources.
-  Coordination: Budgetary control involves the preparation and participation  of  a  master  budget,  which  helps  in  bringing  effective coordination  and  cooperation  among  different  departments  of  the organization.

-  Increase  in  Efficiency: Budgetary  controls  lay  down  the  standards  of production,  sales,  costs  and  overheads  keeping  in  mind  various  internal and external factors. This forces and stimulates every department to attain maximum efficiency on the use of men, machine, material, methods and money.
-  Financial Planning : Budgets are generally expressed in financial terms in the organisation. They provide the estimates of expenditures and revenues in  the  organisation.  This  helps  the  management  to  make  plans  about  the flow of cash in such a way that it would never run short of working capital in the organization.

## 4.2.9  Advantage of Budgetary Control

Some of the advantages of budgetary control are as follows:

-  Definite  planning :  Budgets  are  based  on  the  well-defined  plans.  Thus  budgets help  the  management  and  the  managers  to  know  what  is  expected  of  them  to achieve organizational goal.
-  Enhanced  efficiency :  Budgeting  is  an  effective  way  of  controlling  costs  and eliminating wastage. It promotes economy and efficiency.
-  Control: Budgeting  is  an  important  technique  for  keeping  control  over  the activities  of  the  organization  as  budgets  provide  standards  against  which  actual performance  can  be  measured  and  compared.  This  helps  in  taking  corrective action, which is an important part of controlling.
-  Co-ordination: It  promotes  co-ordination  between  different  departments  or divisions of the organization. In preparation of various budgets, knowledge, skill and experience of many executives are combined and business plans are reduced into  concrete  numerical  terms  in  the  organization.  This  leads  to  proper coordination  of  the  efforts  of  various  departments  of  the  enterprise  in  the organization.
-  Delegation of authority :  Budgeting  encourages delegation of authority. It fixes the  limits  within  which  delegated  authority  can  be  used.  It  act  as  an  important device  for  fixing  the  responsibility  of  various  positions.  The  persons  occupying various positions can be made to understand their responsibilities with the help of budgets.
-  Motivation: Budgets act as a strong incentive to employees by fixing targets of performance.  Thereby  motivating  them  to  perform  better  so  as  to  achieve organization goal.
-  Responsibility  can  be  pinpointed :  Budgets  helps  in  identifying  the  weak  area which  are  not  able  to  work  according  to  planned  budget  thereby  helps  in

identifying  the  weak  spot  as  and  helps  in  pinpointing  the  responsibility  on  the department or employees.

-  Maximization of profit: It  aims  at  the  maximization of profit of the enterprise. To  achieve  this  aim  planning  and  co-  ordination  of  different  functions  is undertaken.  There  is  control  over  costs,  revenue  and  capital  expenditures.  The resources are put to optimum use.
-  Forecasting  credit  needs :  The  budgets  of  cash  expenditure  and  cash  receipts make it  possible  for  the  financial  manager  to  forecast  their  need  for  credit  and arrange for it in advance.
-  Optimum utilization of man machine and material: Budgeting in the organization helps  in  reducing  unproductive  operations  by  minimizing  waste  of  resources. Budgets aims at distributing production program according to production capacity and  makes  most  effective  utilization  of  men  material  and  machines  so  as  to achieve organizational goals.
-  Optimum  use  of  capital  resources : Budgeting  in  the  organization  makes financial  planning  and  control  easy.  The  ultimate  effect  of  budgeting  is  the thorough  examination  and  scrutinizing  the  financial  aspect  of  the  business enterprise. This helps in optimum use of financial resources of the enterprise



-  Uniform policy: The  centralization  of  budgetary  control  over  all  divisions  and departments help in carrying out a uniform policy without the disadvantages of an authoritarian type of business organization.
-  Planning orientation . The process of creating a budget takes management away from its short-term, day-to-day management of the business and forces it to think longer-term.  This  is  the  chief  goal  of  budgeting,  even  if  management  does  not succeed in meeting its goals as outlined in the budget - at least it is thinking about the company's competitive and financial position and how to improve it.
-  Profitability review . It helps in review in the profitable area of the business as a properly structured budget points out what areas of the business produce money and which ones use it,  which  forces  management  to  consider  whether  it  should drop some parts of the business, or expand in others.
-  Serves  as  a  beacon  light :  Budgeting  helps  in  providing  benchmarks  or  set standards for actual performance and guide us the path to achieve those standards.
-  Budgeting is an all inclusive management tool .  It  integrates  and  ties  together various  organizational  activities  in  the  organization  right  from  planning  to controlling.
-  Budgetary control in the organization facilities 'control by exception' . It helps in  focusing  the  time  and  effort  of  the  managers  upon  areas,  which  are  most important for the survival of the organization.

-  Budgets  translate  strategic  plans  into  action .  They  specify  the  resources, revenues,  and  activities  required  to  carry  out  the  strategic  plan  for  the  coming year.
-  Proper communication: Budgets improve communication with employees
-  Budgets provide an excellent record of organizational activities.

## 4.2.10  Disadvantages of Budgetary Control

Budgeting suffers from the following disadvantage:

-  The major problem occurs when budgets are applied mechanically and rigidly.
-  Budgets can demotivate employees because of lack of participation. If the budgets are  arbitrarily  imposed  top  down,  employees  will  not  understand  the  reason  for budgeted expenditures, and will not be committed to them.
-  Budgets can cause perceptions of unfairness.
-  Budgets can create competition for resources and politics.
-  A rigid budget structure reduces initiative and innovation at lower levels, making it impossible to obtain money for new ideas.
-  Budgets are estimates and cannot be 100 percent accurate they are as good as data as forecast on which they are based.
-  Sound system of supervision is required to make the budget effective which if not, leave it ineffective.
-  Budgets bring fear in the minds of employee who feels that if they will not adhere to the budgetary will be called as inefficient.
-  Too much emphasis on budgeting in the organization may bring about rigidity in the  enterprise.  It  may  deprive  the  managers  of  the  flexibility  they  require  in managing their departments.
-  Budgeted estimates in the organization are generally based on the price level at a particular  period  of  time.  These  estimates  may  become  useless  when  there  is either inflation or depression in the market.
-  Sometimes budgets in the organization are tested as an end in themselves. Some people may be extra cautious to function within the boundaries of budget figures rather than achieving the enterprise objectives.
-  A budget, which allows liberal expenditure, may be used to hide inefficiency. For instance, a department may be inefficient even though its expenses are within the budget limits in the organization.
-  Budgetary control in itself does not prevent deviation from appearing. It neither ensures  satisfactory  results  nor  control  automatically  in  the  organization.  A deliberate effort has to be made in this direction in the organization.
-  Budgetary  control  in  the  organization  requires  expenditure  of  time,  money  and effort.  Moreover,  it  is  not  easy  to  prepare  various  kinds  of  budgets  in  the organization because of obvious difficulties in forecasting to be used in budgeting
-  Budgeting is a time consuming process and involves expanses.
-  Budgets  cannot  guide  as  to  what  action  should  be  taken  similarly  it  is  not  an outlived program  that must be adhered to under all conditions

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

-  The creativity  and  initiative  in  an  employee  are  hampered  if  the  supervisor  and managers stick to budgets strictly.
-  Budgets may be misused by the manager to find faults in employees and restrict performance rather than improve it.

Essential of Effective Budgetary Control: Following are requirements of a good system of budgetary control in the organization:

-  Quick  Reporting :  A  good  system  of  budgetary  control  in  the  organization requires the establishment of such procedures, which will provide reports on the performance  of  various  operations.  The  reports  should  reach  the  persons concerned  with  the  implementation  of  budgets  without  any  delay  so  that  quick actions may be taken wherever necessary in the organization.
-  Detailed  Organization  Structure :  There  should  be  a  detailed  organization structure  with  properly  designed  authorities,  responsibilities  and  lines  of communication so that everybody in the organization understands the objectives of organization.
-  Frequent  Comparison :  There  should  be  frequent  comparison  between  budget estimates and operating results in the organization.
-  Definite Plan: There should be comprehensive planning in the organisation. All the  operations  in  the  organisation  should  be  planned  in  clear  terms.  The administration of the budgets should also be properly planned in the organisation. It must be pre-determined who is to be held responsible for the implementation of budget in the organization.
-  Responsibility Matched  by  the  Authority : Those assigned with the responsibility  to  implement  the  budgets  should  also  be  given  the  necessary authority  to  achieve  the  budgeted  targets  in  the  organisation.  Lack  of  sufficient authority will make the implementation of budgets ineffective in the organisation.
-  Participation: The purpose of budgetary control is to achieve coordination among the departments to achieve organizational objective. Therefore, it is essential that participation  from  top  to  bottom  should  be  ensured  to  make  the  employees committed to the budgets.
-  Support of the Management :  The  top  management  in  the  organisation  should support a good system of budgetary control.
-  Flexibility: Budgets  should  not  be  rigid,  instead  should  be  flexible  enough  to allow changes or remodeling in case of any change in the organization.

Limitations of Budgetary Control: There are following limitations of budgetary control:

- o Too  much  emphasis on  budgeting  in  the  organization  may  bring  about rigidity  in  the  enterprise.  It  may  deprive  the  managers  of  the  flexibility they require in managing their departments.

- o Budgeted estimates in the  organisation  are  generally  based  on  the  price level at a particular period of time. These estimates may become useless when there is either inflation or depression in the market.
- o Sometimes budgets in the organization are tested as an end in themselves. Some people may be extra cautious to function within the boundaries of budget figures rather than achieving the enterprise objectives.
- o A  budget , which  allows  liberal  expenditure,  may  be  used  to  hide inefficiency. For instance, a department may be inefficient even though its expenses are within the budget limits in the organisation.
- o Budgetary control in itself does not prevent deviation from appearing. It neither  ensures  satisfactory  results  nor  control  automatically  in  the organisation.  A  deliberate  effort  has  to  be  made  in  this  direction  in  the organisation.
- o Budgetary  control in  the  organisation  requires  expenditure  of  time, money  and  effort.  Moreover,  it  is  not  easy  to  prepare  various  kinds  of budgets in the organisation because of obvious difficulties in forecasting to be used in budgeting.

## 4.3 Yield Management

Yield Management is becoming part of the standard operating procedure(SOP) for many hotels  with  property-Management  systems  (PMS)  being  used  in  hotel  industry. Appropriately designed to meet the hotels need, yield management systems generally tries to increase revenue and do much of the guesswork out of rooms-management decisions.

THE CONCEPT OF YIELD MANAGEMENT: The airline industry is considered as the  birthplace  of  yield  management.  After  deregulation  in  the  late1970s,  airline competition  increased,  and  the  airlines  tried  to  operate  their  planes  as  efficiently  as possible. As they knew their product is perishable in nature eg airplane seat if not sold on a  particular  day  cannot  be  stored  for  future  use  ie  revenue  lost  from  that  seat  is  lost forever so to avoid losses and to maximize revenue- Yield management was one of the methods developed as a way of increasing competitive advantage and increasing revenue. In airlines, yield management is concerned with selling the right seat to the right customer at the right price so as to maximize yield.

The airline and hotel industries have several characteristics in common that make them ideal candidates for yield-management systems, the most important one is that both their product or services are perishable ie Each has a fixed number of products (hotel rooms and airline seats) that, if not sold on a certain day or flight, cannot be resold eg a guest room if not sold on particular day cannot be stored for future use- revenue lost for the day is  lost  forever.  Besides  that  Both  have  relatively  fixed  capacities.  Once  an  airplane  has been purchased or a hotel has been built, it is rather difficult and expensive to increase capacity. The idea, then, is to use the available capacity in the best (most profitable) way possible. Moreover Airlines and hotels sell to market segments that have distinct needs in product and service level. Each has demand periods (holidays, weekdays, and weekends in hotels; holidays, weekdays, and time of day for airlines) that place the provider in a favorable position. Airlines and hotels have various rates from which guests can choose. Reservations  allow  managers  to  use  yield  management.  By  using  computers  to  track  a database of products (hotel rooms and airline seats) and to process reservations, managers have the ability to look at a sales horizon of 45 to 90 days and to set price and reservation policies that will allow a prediction of profitability.

Thereby  from  above  discussion  it  is  clear  that  when  any  organisation  or  industry  is operating with a relatively fixed capacity, when demand can be segmented into clearly identified  partitions,  when  inventory  is  perishable,  when  the  product  is  sold  well  in advance, when demand fluctuates substantially, and when marginal sales costs are low but marginal production costs are high- Yield-management techniques are appropriate to use to get maximum revenue.

## 4.3.1  What is Yield Management?

Yield management can be defined as -selling a product or service to the right customer, at the right time, and at the right price‖. Or can be defined as -It is a technique based on supply  and  demand  used,  to  maximize  revenues  by  lowering  prices  to  increase  sales during periods of low demand and raising prices during periods of high demand‖. It is also  known  as  revenue  management  or  yield  management.  As  the  history  of  yield

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

management provides the framework for developing background of revenue management, the  key  to  successful  revenue  management  is  to  sell  the  right  product  (guestrooms, banquets,  ancillary  services)  to  the  right  customer  (business,  leisure,  convention, government or any other guest) on the right day (weekday, weekend) for the right price (rack rate, corporate rate, or any other discounted rate). Yield management is the source for the concepts that underlie revenue management.

Basically, yield management is the process of allocating the right type of capacity to the right kind of customer at the right price so as to maximize revenue or yield. In the case of hotels, yield management is concerned with the number of rooms that should be sold at various  rate  levels.  The  manager  would  prefer  to  sell  all  rooms  at  the  highest  rate possible, but since this rarely is possible, following this policy may lead to empty rooms and  lost  revenue.  Conversely,  if  a  hotel  fills  its  rooms  with  low-price  customers,  the revenue that  could  have been obtained  from higher rates will be lost. The objective of yield management, then, is to define what should be done, so as to get maximum revenue in all possible situations. How many rooms should be allocated to and protected for each market segment over time?

Yield Management also is not only a Technique used to Maximize Room Revenues but also  act  as  an  evaluative  Tool  that  allows  the  Front  Office  Manager  to  use  Potential Revenue as the Standard against which Actual Revenue can be Compared.

## 4.3.2   Applicability to Room Division

As already mentioned that Hotel and hospitality industry faces the common problem that they produce a fixed inventory of perishable products which cannot be stored if unsold by a  specific  time.  The  commodity(room)  that  the  hotel  sells  is  perishable  in  nature  ,  if  a room goes unsold on a given day there is no way to recover the time lost and therefore the revenue lost and is, lost forever for that time, therefore these products are typically sold for  varying  prices  that  depends  on  the  time  of  the  transaction  and  the  proposal  date  of delivery. As yield management strategies can be applied to virtually any type of business that: have a fixed number of products to sell, examples include hotel rooms etc and from the  day  the  hotel  industry's  has  shifted  their  focus  from  high  volume  booking  to  high profit booking, yield management has gain lot of importance in the hotel industry, as they understood  that  mere  volume  sale  do  not  generate  the  desired  revenue,  and,  yield management is composed of a set of demand forecasting techniques used to determine whether  room  rates  should  be  raised  or  lowered,  and  whether  a  reservation  should  be accepted or rejected in order to maximize revenue

Thereby  as  per  the  definition  of  yield  management,  Front  office  managers  have successfully applied such demand - forecasting strategies to room reservation systems, management  information  system,  room  and  package  pricing,  rooms  and  revenue management, seasonal rate determination, pre-theater dinner specials, and special, group, tour operator, and travel agent rates.

Besides that one of the major differences in how yield management is used in airlines and hotels  is  that  at  the  hotel,  the  guest  may  also  spend  money  for  products  and  services besides  the  room  itself.  While  in  the  airline  passenger  usually  does  not  have  an opportunity to spend large amounts of money during a flight. Because of this difference, hoteliers  must  consider  the  financial  potential  of  one  prospective  guest  over  another  in determining reservation policies.

## 4.3.3 Importance of Yield Management

Different benefits of yield management are

- a. It helps in improving forecasting.
- b. Improved seasonal pricing and inventory decisions: It helps in deciding the seasonal and off seasonal pricing for rooms and other products also helps in making important inventory decision.
- c. It helps in the identification of new market segments
- d. Identification of market segment demands
- e. Increased coordination between the front office and sales divisions
- f. Determination of discounting activity: It helps in deciding the amount of discount to be offered to the guest depending upon the dates and periods.
- g. It helps in the development of short-term and long-term business plans
- h. Establishment  of  a  value  based  rate  structure  -It  helps  in  defining  rate structures, based on perceived values.
- i. It helps in Increasing business and profit margin of the organization
- j. It helps in savings labor costs and other operating expenses
- k. Planned responses to guest inquiries or requests regarding reservations

## 4.3.4 Tools of Yield Management

In order to maximize Revenue, the Front Office Manager needs to forecast Information In three ways:

-  Capacity Management
-  Discount Allocation
-  Duration Control

Capacity Management: Capacity Management which is also called as selective overbooking  involves  a  number  of  methods  of  controlling  and  limiting  room supply. For example, hotels in general will accept a statistically supported number of  reservations  in  excess  of  actual  room  availability  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  the losses generated through the situation of early check-outs, cancellations, and noshows. Capacity management balances the risk of overselling guestrooms against the  potential  loss  of  revenue  arising  from  spoilage  because  rooms  going unoccupied after reservations were closed out.

Other forms of capacity management include determining how many walk-ins to accept  on  the  day  of  arrival  based  on  expected  cancellations  and  no-shows. Capacity  management  usually  varies  with  room  type.  That  is,  it  might  be economically  advantageous  to  overbook  more  in  lower-priced  rooms,  because upgrading to higher-priced rooms is an acceptable solution to an oversell problem. The  amount  of  such  overbooking  depends,  on  course,  on  the  demand  for  the

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

higher-priced  rooms.  In  sophisticated  computerized  yield  management  systems, capacity  management  may  also  be  influenced  by  the  availability  of  rooms  at neighboring hotels or competing properties.

Discount  Allocation: Discounting  involves  restricting  the  time  period  and product mix (rooms available at reduced prices (prices below rack rate). For each discounted room type, reservations are requested at various available rates, each set below rack rate. The theory is that the sale of a perishable item (the guestroom) at  a  reduced  price  is  often  better  than  no  sale  at  all.  The  primary  objective  of discount allocation is to protect enough remaining rooms at a higher rate to satisfy the projected demand for rooms at that rate; while at the same time filling rooms that would otherwise have remained unsold. This process is repeated for each rate level  from  rack  rate  on  down.  Implementing  such  a  scheme  requires  a  reliable mechanism for demand forecasting.

A second objective of limiting discounts by room type is to encourage upselling. This technique requires a sound estimate of price elasticity and / or the probability of upgrading. (Elasticity refers to the relationship between price and demand.) If a small  increase  in  price  causes  drop  in  demand  the  market  is  said  to  be  elastic while, if small increase in price causes no effect on demand, the market is said to be inelastic produces little or no effect on demand.

Duration  Control: Duration  control  places  time  constraints  on  accepting reservations  in  order  to  protect  sufficient  space  for  multi-day  requests (representing higher levels of revenue). This means that, under yield management, a reservation for a one night stay may be rejected, even though space is available.

## 4.3.5 Measuring Yield

Yield  management  is  designed  to  measure  revenue  generated  by  the  hotel.  For  the calculation of  yield management is yield statistic, which is the ratio of actual revenue to potential revenue. Actual revenue is the revenue generated by the number of rooms sold. Potential revenue is the amount of money that would be received if all rooms were sold at full rack rates.

𝒀𝒊𝒆𝒍𝒅 =

## 𝑨𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆

## 𝑷𝒐𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆

The mathematics of yield management is relatively simple, although several formulas are involved. These are:

## Formula 1: Potential Average Single Rate

It is calculated by multiplying the number of rooms in each type by its single room rack rate and dividing the sum total by the number of potential single rooms in the hotel.

𝑷𝒐𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝑨𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑺𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝑹𝒂𝒕𝒆  = 𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝒂𝒕 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆𝒔

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

## Formula 2: Potential Average Double Rate

It is calculated by multiplying the number of rooms in each type by its respective doubleroom rack rate and dividing the sum total by the number of potential double rooms in the hotel.

𝑷𝒐𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝑨𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑫𝒐𝒖𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝑹𝒂𝒕𝒆  = 𝑫𝒐𝒖𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆 𝒂𝒕 𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒌 𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝒂𝒕 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆𝒔

## Formula 3: Multiple Occupancy Percentage

An  important  element  in  determining  a  hotel's  yield  statistic  is  the  proportion  of  the hotel's room that are occupied by more than one person, that is, the multiple occupancy percentage. This information is important because it indicate sales mix and helps balance rates with future occupancy demand

## Multiple occupancy = Number of rooms Occupied by More than One Guest Number of Rooms Occupied

## Formula 4: Rate Spread

The determination of a room rate spread among various room types can be essential to the use of yield decisions in targeting a hotel's specific market. The mathematical difference between the hotel's  potential  average  single  rate  and  potential's  average  double  rate  is known as rate spread

Rate Spread = Potential Average Double Rate - Potential Average Single Rate

## Formula 5: Potential Average Rate

The  one  very  important  element  in  revenue  management  formulation  is  the  potential average  rate.  A  hotel's  potential  average  rate  is  a  collective  statistic  that  effectively combines the potential average rates, multiple occupancy percentage, and rate spread. The potential average rate is determined in two steps. The first step involves multiplying the rate  spread  by  the  hotel's  multiple  occupancy  percentage.  The  result  is  added  to  the hotel's potential average single rate to produce a potential average rate based on demand (sales mix) and room rate information.

Potential  Average  Rate  =  Multiple  Occupancy%  X  Rate  Spread  plus  Potential Average Single Rate

## Formula 6: Room Rate Achievement Factor

The percentage of the rack rate that the hotel actually receives is contained in the hotel's achievement factor (AF), also called the rate potential percentage. The achievement factor is  found  by  dividing  the  actual  rate  the  hotel  is  currently  collecting  by  the  potential average  rate.  The  actual  average  rate  is  equals  to  total  room  revenue  divided  by  either rooms sold or rooms occupied.

## Formula 7: Yield Statistic

An  important  element  in  yield  management  is  the  yield  statistic.  The  yield  statistic calculation incorporates several of the previous formulas into a critical index. There are various equivalent ways to express the yield equation. There are various ways to calculate yield statistical of which are equivalent.

𝒀𝒊𝒆𝒍𝒅 = 𝑨𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆 𝑷𝒐𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆

𝐘𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝 =

𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐝𝐲

×

𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞

𝐏𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞

## Yield = Occupancy Percentage x Achievement Factor

Instead of computing yield as a percentage, some lodging operations prefer an alternate statistic which focuses on revenue per available room (REVPAR or REVPAR). The Rev PAR can be calculated using either of the following equations:

𝑹𝒆𝒗𝑷𝑨𝑹 = 𝑨𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆 𝑨𝒗𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔

Rev PAR   = Occupancy % x ADR

## Formula 8: Identical Yields

It  involves calculation of different combinations of occupancy and actual average room rate which may result in identical room revenue and yield statistic. It other words it means equivalent gross revenue.

𝑰𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒍 𝒀𝒊𝒆𝒍𝒅𝒔 = 𝑪𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒆 ×𝑶𝒄𝒄𝒖𝒑𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒚 %

## Formula 9: Equivalent Occupancy

A more effective way of evaluating whether a change in room rates is justifiable or not involves determining an equivalent occupancy. The equivalent occupancy formula can be used  when  management  wants  to  know;  what  other  combinations  of  room  rate  and occupancy percentage provide equivalent net revenue. The marginal cost of providing a room  is  the  cost  the  hotel  incurs  by  selling  that  room  (for  example,  cleaning  and supplies); this cost would not be incurred if the room were not sold.

Equivalent Occupancy = Current Occupancy % x Rack rate - Marginal Cost /   Rack Rate x (1 Discount %) - Marginal Cost

Equivalent Occupancy = Current Occupancy % x   Current Contribution Margin/

New Contribution Margin

## Formula10: Required Non-Room Revenue for Guest

Non room revenue means revenue generated from centers others than room such as food and beverage etc. If manager decides that in order to increase room occupancy percentage offers discount and reduces room rates then this would render an off selling changes in non room revenues and involves determining or estimating a number of elements:

-  The net loss in room revenue due to room rate discounting
-  The amount of non-room revenue needed to compensate this loss.
-  The average amount each guest spends in non-room revenue centers.
-  The increase in occupancy likely to result from rate discounting

The  breakeven  calculation  is  based  on  the  weighted  average  contribution  margin  ratio (CMRw) for all non-room revenue centers. While a detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this text, a simple formula for determining the CMRw for all nonroom revenue centers is as follows:

𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨  =

𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐧 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 - 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐧 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐫𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐭

## 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐍𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞

## 4.3.6  Elements of Yield Management

The following elements must be included in the development of a successful revenue or hotel yield management strategy:

-  Group room sales
-  Transient or FIT room sales
-  Food and Beverage activity
-  Local and area-wide activities
-  Special events

Group  Room  Sales  and  its  effect  on  Hotel  Yield: A  group  sale  provides  the  bulk booking and thereby forms the majority of the room revenue and is very important for hotel yield. It is common for the hotels to receive group reservations for group sales from three months to two years in advance of arrival. Therefore understanding group booking trends  and  requirements  is  very  essential  for  the  success  of  revenue  management.  To understand the impact of group sales on overall room revenue, the hotel should collect as much group profile information as possible, including:

Group booking data It is a common practice that Groups tend to block 5-10% percent more rooms than they actually require. Thus FOM analyze and checks that If a group has a previous business profile with the hotel than on the basis of their past records, he can often adjust the block on the basis of group's booking history. The hotel's deletion of unnecessary group rooms from a group block is called the ‗wash  factor'.  However  management  must  be  very  much  careful  in  estimating how many rooms to be ‗washed' or deleted from the block as if a group block is reduced by too many rooms, the hotel may find itself overbooked and unable to give rooms to all the members of the group and it will effect hotel yield badly.

Group booking pace The rate at which group business is being booked is called group  booking  pace.  The  rate  at  which  initial  agreement  between  the  group organizers and hotel takes place, over a period of time.

Anticipated group business - Hotels generally watches out for repetitive group patterns and act accordingly in order to forecast the pressure on the market, and thereby  adjusting  their  selling  strategies  many  national,  regional  and  state associations  as  well  as  some  corporate,  have  policies  regarding  the  locations  of annual meeting.

Group  booking  lead  time -  A  measurement  of  how  far  in  advance  group bookings  are  made  ie  lead  time  is  the  gap  between  the  date  of  booking  and expected date of arrival. The hotel should fix the lead time for group booking the lead time together with the pace of booking is important in deciding how much additional group business should be accepted. If the current booking pace is lower than  expected  a  lower  rate  to  stimulate  the  business  should  be  offered  to  get increased occupancy and if demand is strong an group booking pace is ahead of the trends no discounts should be offered.

Displacement of transient business -The process of Displacement means when the hotel decides to accept the group business even if they have to turn away the transient guest, although the transient guest are ready to pay higher room rates is the  acceptance  of  group  bookings  instead  of  transient  guests.  Since  transient guests or FITs pay higher room rates than group business, the reservations team should consult its forecast staff whether or not to accept group business for better hotel  yield.  As  well  as  there  is  risk  of  bad  reputation,  so  the  Front  Office Management  should  monitor  and  ensure  that  by  transient  displacement  more revenue generation and higher occupancy should be achieved by the hotel, and to avoid  the  situation  that  transient  guest  who  will  not  return  back  to  the  hotel because  of  their  initial  treatment,  the  hotel  must  take  care  of    and  by accommodating them in some other hotel of the same standards and should be in constant touch with the guests as to give them the feeling that hotel really cares for them.

Transient or FIT room sales and its effect on yield: Transient rooms are the rooms sold to  free  individual  travelers  (FIT)  or  non  group  travelers.  Transient  business  is  usually booked near to their date of arrival than group business who books their rooms one to three months in advance; transient may book their room only one to three weeks before arrival. Thus in order to maximize room revenues, front office managers may:

-  Monitor and keep a track of the booking pace and lead time for highest occupancy rate.
-  Classify rooms on the basis of their location, desirability or size, and charge more for better rooms.
-  Hotels may offer deluxe rooms at standard rates to attract guests especially when demand is low to scale hotel yield.
-  Discounts reduce the amount of business lost because of rate resistance and allow the  hotels  to  sell  rooms  that  would  otherwise  remain  vacant.  Discounts  can  be offered  to  corporate  guests,  government  travelers,  senior  citizens,  military  and airline personnel etc.
-  Controlling  discounts  also  is  very  important  for  generating  the  highest  revenue and hotel yield.

Food and Beverage activity and Hotel Yield: Food and beverage activities in particular catering  for  functions  and  receptions  etc  generate  revenue  for  hotel  independently  they can  have  an  effect  on  room  revenue.  For  example,  if  a  banquet  with  no  guestroom requirements is occupying the hotel's banquet hall, while a group needing 50 guestrooms and a banquet hall may have to be turned away. Therefore a group needing both catering and  guestrooms  is  more  profitable.  Thus  the  hotel  staff  should  be  encouraged  to  book such groups who need both accommodation as well as fooding and banquet hall and other function facilities etc from the hotel only (such as marriage parties or corporate having residential  conference)  so  as  to  earn  revenue  from  both  rooms  and  food  and  beverage also.  Special  packages  can  be  made  and  offered  to  the  guest  for  this  a  effective communication and coordination between departments is necessary to maximize revenue from all revenue centers in the hotel.

Local and Area-Wide activities and Hotel Yield: Local  and  area  wide  activities  like conventions, meetings etc, have a great effect on the revenue management strategies of the hotel. The front office manager and sales or marketing division should be aware of such activities taking place in the destination and the demand for guestrooms created by them in the area. The room rates should be offered according to the demand to take full advantage of the opportunity. Even when a Hotel is not in the immediate vicinity of a Convention, Transient  Guests  and  Smaller  Groups  displaced  by  the  Convention  as  one individual hotel may not be able to accommodate all the guest thereby displacing them, the FOM should be ready to cash such situations by inviting them in their hotel may be referred to the Hotel (as an Overflow Facility) and this will have a tremendous impact on Hotel's Revenue

Special  Events  and  Hotel  Yield: Special  events  such  as  concerts,  festivals  and  sports events  held  in  or  near  the  hotel  are  also  very  important  for  the  hotels  yield.  The  front office manager should be able to take advantage of these events by controlling discount ie hotels  might  decide  to  benefit  from  high  demand  by  restricting  room  rate  discounts  or requiring a minimum length of stay.

## 4.3.7 Yield Management Strategies

A hotel needs to determine revenue management strategies for both high and low demand periods. Transient and group business market segments may each require a unique and specific strategy so as to maximize revenue:

Potential  High  Demand  Techniques: During  high  demand  periods  the  normal techniques is to increase room revenue by maximizing average room rate. Besides that there are some other tactics that can be used to maximize room revenue:

-  Try to determine the right mix of market segments in order to sell out the highest possible  room  rates.  This  strategy  is  highly  dependent  upon  accurate  sales  mix forecasting.
-  Monitor New Business Bookings and use these changed Conditions to  reassign Room
-  Inventory.  As  Occupancy  increases,  consider  closing  the  lower  room  rates, management  should be prepared to reopen the lower room rates as the demand begin to decrease, management must closely monitor demand and be  flexible in adjusting room rates.
-  Consider establishing a Minimum Number of Nights per Stay restriction carefully. For example, resort that always fills to capacity over weekend   may ask the guest a three day minimum stay in order to better control occupancy.
-  Close or restrict discounts - Analyze the discounts and restrict them as necessary to maximize the average rate. You may offer discounts to those guest who books for longer stays, or restrict bookings to shorter stays.
-  Reduce  group  room  allocations  is  another  great  tactics-  Communicate  and coordinate  with  group  leaders  on  a  regular  basis.  Make  sure  the  group  actually

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

- needs  the  number  of  rooms  specified  in  its  contract.  If  not,  make  early adjustments.
-  Reduce  or  eliminate  6  P.M  holds  -  Reduce  or  eliminate  the  number  of  unpaid rooms  that  are  being  held  until  6  p.m.  When  demand  is  high,  you  need  rooms available to fill.
-  Tighten  guarantee  and  cancellation  policies  tactics-  Tightening  guarantee  and cancellation policies helps to ensure payment for room nights. Charge credit cards for the first night's stay on the day the reservation is made.
-  Tactics  on  raise  rates  to  be  consistent  with  the  competitors  -  Charge  rates consistent with the competition, but limit rate increases to those rates published in the central reservations systems and listed in brochures for the period.
-  Consider  a  rate  raise  for  packages  -  If  you  are  already  offering  a  package discount, consider raising the rate for that package.
-  Apply  full  prices  to  suites  and  executive  rooms  -  In  a  high-demand  situation charge full price for suites and executive rooms.
-  Reserve  close  to  arrival  dates  -  By  allowing  the  reservations  to  be  taken  for  a certain  date  as  long  as  the  guest  arrives  before  that  date,  a  property  is  able  to control the volume of check-ins.
-  Evaluate the benefits of sell-through - With a sell through, the required stay can begin before the date the strategy is applied. This is often used when one day has a peak in occupancy and management does not want the peak to adversely affect reservations on either side of the peak day.
-  Apply deposits  and  guarantees  to  the  last  night  of  stay  -  For  longer  lengths  of stay,  make  sure  the  deposits  and  guarantees  apply  to  the  last  night  of  the  stay, minimizing early departures.

Besides the above tactics, a number of group business tactics may be appropriate during high demand periods, while deciding between two groups or more, one should select the group  that  produces  highest  total  revenue.  For  this  FOM  or  management  must  rely  on their previous experience with the groups to develop the effective management policies. Keeping the focus on the total revenue it is good to sell blocks of guest rooms to groups because they not only give money through rooms but also provide revenue through the purchase  of  meeting  place,  food  and  beverage  services  and  other  hospitality  products from the hotel. This tactic usually requires restricting access of local patrons to functions meeting and public spaces if these spaces are booked by local patrons potentially more profitable for groups needing such space may be forced to go elsewhere. Another tactics for  handling  group  business  during  high  demand  periods  is  to  attempt  to  move  price sensitive groups to low demand days. In other words if the hotel forecast is high demand for a time when a price sensitive group has already booked space, management may try to reschedule the group's business to a period of lower demand. This tactic which is often easier said than done allow the hotel to replace the lower room rate group with a group willing to pay higher rates.

Potential  Low  Demand  Techniques: The  strategy  for  transient  and  group  business during low demand period:

-  Carefully design a flexible Rating System that permits Sales team to offer lower Rates

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

-  under  Certain  Situations,  such  rates  should  be  decided  during  early  planning period keeping in mind the time of low demand periods.
-  Strive to accurately project expected Market Mix, the precision of this projection will influence the eventual yield statistic.
-  Management  should  closely  monitor  Group  Bookings  and  Trends  in  Transient Business and do Not close off lower Rate and Market Segments arbitrarily
-  During    low  occupancy  periods,  open  Lower  Rate  Categories,  solicit  Price Sensitive Groups, promote Corporate, Government, and other Special Discounts, and consider develop New Rate Packages and soliciting business from the local community
-  Consider  maintaining  High  Room  Rates  for  Walk-in  Guests  since  these  guests have not contacted the hotel prior to arrival they typically present an opportunity to increase the average rate through top down up selling technique.
-  A Non-Financial Technique that involves upgrading Guests to a higher category of room than they asked for or are entitled to by virtue of their Room Rate. This techniques may lead to increased guest satisfaction and enhanced customer loyalty but the implementation of this strategy is purely a management decision and has some risks also like for eg the guest may expect the same upgrade on future stay which may not be possible in future and front desk staff has to take extra care to explain that this is a special one time upgrade because the hotel appreciates guest business.
-  Sell value and benefits tactics- Rather than just quoting rates, make sure guests know you have the right product for them at the best value. Sell the various values and  benefits  of  staying  at  your  property  versus  others  that  the  guests  may  be considering.
-  Tactics  on  Offer  packages  -  To  increase  room  nights,  one  tactic  is  to  combine accommodations with a number of desirable products and services into a single package  with  one  price.  Mention  any  additions,  renovations,  or  new  amenities. Non-room  revenue  can  be  included,  for  example  -  free  movies,  discounted attraction tickets and shopping coupons.
-  Keep discount categories open - Discounts are directed toward particular markets or are instituted during a particular time or season. During low-demand time, it is important to accept discounts to encourage room nights.
-  Offer stay-sensitive price incentives - A stay sensitive price incentive provides a discount for guests who stay longer. For example, a guest staying 3 nights might get  an  additional  Rs.2000/-  per  night  discount,  while  a  guest  staying  one  night might not
-  Remove stay restrictions - Remove any stay restrictions so guests are not limited as to when they can arrive or depart. Guests who can stay only one night will be encouraged to stay as well as those who are staying for a week. This will help to maximize occupancy.
-  Involve your staff - Create an incentive contest to increase occupancy and room nights. Make sure to involve all members of revenue department as well as central reservations staff.
-  Establish  relationships  with  competitors  -  Having  a  cordial  relationship  with competitors  can  help  with  referrals  and  can  help  to  carry  out  cross-marketing efforts.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

-  Lower rates tactics- There is great value in keeping guests at the property as long as you are at least covering the cost of occupancy. You may want to lower your rates  as  low  as  possible.  Identify  the  hurdle  rate,  which  is  the  lowest  rate acceptable at that given moment

Implementing Revenue strategies: Once all the tactics are being analyzed and decided than the FOM must decide what rates will be applicable on any given day, as rack rates are  always  left  open  whether  demand  is  high  or  low  than  in  order  to  implement  these tactics, Management or FOM must establishes the Hurdle Rate or The Lowest Rate for a Given Day, below which it is impossible to sell any Room ie any room that can be sold at the rate above the hurdle rate is acceptable by the management while if the room rates goes below these hurdle rates this should not be the situation. Some automated revenue system do not even display the room rates below the hurdle rate this preventing their use, hurdle rates can fluctuate from day to day, season to season depending upon the hotel's desired  yield  and  market  conditions,  the  hurdle  rates  usually  reflects  the  FOM  pricing strategy  to  maximize  yield.  Sometimes  incentives  are  being  offered  to  front  desk  and reservation  staff  for  selling  the  rooms  above  the  hurdle  rate.  Incentives  may  also  be provided for longer guest stays, for eg a guest staying for three nights may qualify for lower rates than a guest staying for one night, this is called as stay sensitive hurdle rate. Reservation staff should receive incentive for booking a guest with there night stay even if it is at lower rate, because the total revenue generated from reservation will be greater than the revenue of one or two night stay.

## 4.3.8   Yield Management Team

The yield is primarily concerned with accommodation in the hotel industry, so everyone who  is  concerned  with  it  either  directly  or  indirectly  with  it  forms  the  team  of  yield management.  Basically  three  persons-front  office/room  division  manager,  reservation manager and sales manager comprise the team of the yield management. The front office manager  has  the  overall  control  of  the  department  with  the  targets  of  maximizing occupancy  and  revenue.  Reservation  manager  has  complete  information  of  booking patterns, past histories and trends pace and bad times etc of hotels and its bookings, and sales department who bring business and whose primary function is to get guests to the hotel and hence working with the forecast team ensures that his department's team is fully aware of highs and lows of the hotel business.

The role of the team is primarily to forecast the demand of rooms and to assess whether to take transient or FIT in preference to group etc ie allocating the right number of rooms to various  market  segments  on  the  basis  of  discussing  reasoning  and  possible  revenue generation calculation. Factors such as historical data, expected walk-ins, corporate rate business  volume  or  corporate  guest  are  also  considered.  The  team  working  on  yield management will decide on the levels of rates to open or close. Feedback sessions are another  important  function  of  yield  management  team.  It  is  basically  done  to  assess whether  the  decision  taken  with  respect  to  revenue  and  occupancy  management  and strategies used were effective and accurate or not. Feedback also tells about the efficiency and performance of staff and hence is a guide for future improvement. Yield management team should collect as much information as possible and as fast as possible and should react to it immediately so as not to loose any opportunity as it comes to the hotel. There

might be situation coming where the hotel rooms may be full yet the revenue yield may not  be  maximum  possible  if  the  information  collected  is  not  complete  or  action  is  not taken immediately.

## 4.3.9 Yield Management Software

Although the individual task of revenue management can be performed manually, but for processing  of  large  databases  it  is  impossible  without  appropriate  yield  management software that too at much faster pace and with great accuracy thus hotels that uses these software gain strategic advantage over those that rely on intuitive revenue management decisions  only.  Yield  management  software  helps  revenue  of  front  office  managers  by giving suggestions on price amendments, inventory control and channel management, and can  integrate  room  demand  and  room  price  statistics  and  can  stimulate  high  revenue producing  product.  A  yield  management  software  is  designed  to  analyze  raw  data collected  from  in  house  property,  management  system,  creates  booking  patterns, categories all information and prepares forecasting reports. The software should be able to:

-  Establish and monitors the hotel rate structure
-  Continual monitor's reservation activity and set inventory controls as needed
-  Identify  the  high  and  low  demand  periods  of  the  hotel  and  prepares  hotel  act accordingly
-  Helps in rate negotiation with travel wholesalers and group booking
-  Monitor and restrict the number of reservation that can be taken for any particular room night or room rate/room type.
-  Matches the right room product and rate with guest need's and sensitivities.
-  Makes the organisation ready for the changes in the competitive world
-  Screening the available data and makes necessary projections for decision making of what action should be taken in terms of rate, occupancy and revenue etc.

Thus  on  one  hand,  the  software  analyses  enormous  data  bases  and  provides  useful forecasts based on the optimization models embedded in it and on the other hand, helps the revenue managers to plan for future and helps in decision making ie it is able to keep track  of  a  wide  range  of  forecasting  data,  and  responds  more  flexibly  to  changes  in booking levels: swiftly recognizing where demand is getting ahead of, or falling behind, forecast,  at  any  given  time.  The  system  can  then  help  reservations  clerks  in  taking  the right  decision  about  what  bookings  to  take  and  at  what  price.  The  system  accesses  the database  of  all  historical  guest  information,  fluctuations  in  demand,  room  rates  and sources of business. In addition, data can be input on local events and other factors which might  attract  higher  demand  in  a  certain  period.  Thereby  computer  based  yield management system has become a popular hotel industry software application.

## 4.4 Summary

In  technical  view,  a  budget  is  a  statement  that  includes  a  combination  of  revenues  and expenditures for a period of time, generally a year. It is a broad plan of action prepared to achieve the policy objectives set by the management for the coming year. It can be called as the blueprint of how the revenue generated will be utilized by the organisation. There are  different  types  of  budget  like  fixed  budget,  flexible  budget,  departmental  budget, master budget etc but  the  two  main  budget  prepared  by  front  office  are  capital  budget which include expenditure for those items which have lifespan of more than one year eg furniture and fixtures of front office software of front office etc whereas operating budget includes the expenditure required for daily operation of the organization eg labour cost etc.  Besides  that  the  most  important  function  of  FOM  in  budget  is  to  forecast  room revenue  and  estimating  related  expenses  as  most  expanses  of  front  office  are  direct  in

nature,  and  historical  data  can  be  analyzed  to  calculate  the  room  revenue  that  each expense  item  may  represent.  The  management  of  hotel  uses  budgetary  control  for controlling cost and maximizing profit as it helps in continuous comparison of actual with budgeted figures so that timely action can be taken in case of deviation.

Here in this unit we studied yield and the various techniques that are used to maximize revenue  generation  in  the  hospitality  industry.  Yield  is  the  ratio  of  actual  revenue generated  to  potential  revenue.  These  techniques  are  applicable  to  all  the  perishable products  and  services  .yield  management  or  revenue  management  is  a  pricing  strategy based on demand and supply as when demand increases more than supply, the prices are raised and when supply increases than demand, prices are reduced or lowered to attract more business. The yield management tools are capacity management, discount allocation and duration control. In a nutshell, yield management can be defined as selling a product or service to the right customer, at the right time, and at the right price so as to maximize revenue.

## 4.5 Key Terms

## 5.2 Introduction

Planning and execution of activities and operations are one of the major responsibilities of  all  managers.  In  Front  office  it  is  given  more  importance  as  it  is  the  major  revenue producing  department  and  the  activities  of  other  departments  are  dependent  on  their activities,  so  the  front  office  manager  (FOM)  has  to  pay  more  time  and  efforts  in identification  of  data  which  can  be  useful  for  planning  in  front  office  operations.  The process of front office management can be divided into specific management functions:

Planning : It is one of the most important management functions as if the planning is  properly  done  it  will  lead  to  the  achievement  of  the  organizational  goals therefore  at  the  planning  stage,  the  front  office  manager  tries  to  determine  the department's goals both short term and long term and later, he will use these goals as a guide for planning more specific and measurable objectives. Finally, the front office manager will decide the strategies and tactics to achieve these objectives.

Organizing :  The front office manager shall organize the work in such a manner that work is so divided among the staff keeping in mind the planned goal as the benchmarks. While doing so, he ensures that the work shall be distributed fairly among the employees and should be completed in a timely manner.

Coordinating :  It  involves bringing together and using the available resources to attain planned goals. The FO manager must be able to coordinates efforts of the employees so that they can perform their work more efficiently and effectively. Effective  coordination  is  not  only  required  among  the  employees  of  the department but also coordination is required with other departments for eg front office coordinating with housekeeping for selling the room so FOM should ensure effective  coordination  within  and  with  other  departments  so  as  to  achieve organizational goal.

Staffing :  It  involves  recruitment  and  selection  of  the  candidates  those  who  best qualifies  for  positions,  and  scheduling  employees.  FO  manger  should  develop staffing  guidelines  which  are  based  on  formulas  for  calculating  the  number  of employees required to meet guest and operational requirements.

Leading : It  involves  guiding,  motivating,  training,  disciplining,  overseeing  and setting an example for the front office employees.

Controlling :  It  involves  setting  the  standards  or  benchmarks,  communicating these  standards  to  employees,  measuring  the  actual  results  of  operations, comparing the measured results with the actual and finally taking the corrective actions.

Evaluating :  It  involves  identifying  the  extent  to  which  planned  goals  are achieved.  Than reviewing it and, when necessary, revising or helping to revise front office goals.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

In this unit the focus is on the two main front office management functions- planning and evaluating of front office operations.

## Planning involves three important front office functions:

- o Establishing room rates
- o Forecasting room sales
- o Budgeting for front office operations (already discussed )

In  order  to  achieve  and  maintain  profitability  the  front  office  manager  is  required  to focus on two important front office management functions:

- 1. Establishing room rates
- 2. Forecasting room Availability

## 5.3 Establishing Room Rates

Revenue management is the technique of planning to achieve maximum room rates and most  profitable  guests.  As  price  is  one  of  the  major  guest  concerns  for  selecting  a particular hotel for stay. Guests with budget constraints may request a room for the lowest price; this is their primary concern, while Room location, floor plan, room arrangements, ancillary equipment, and immediate occupancy play very lesser roles in their choice of room selection. Room price is not only the concern for the guest but also for the hotel. The  pricing  should  be  such  that  it  covers  the  cost  of  production  and  overheads,  and include  a  fair  amount  of  profit,  so  that  the  hotel  business  remains  sustainable  and profitable.  As the room are the major source of revenue for hotel so a competitive and good  room  rent  is  essential  for  running  a  successful  hospitality  business.  As  if  the management fixes low room rates, the hotel operations might not be economical while if they are too high, the guest may not patronize the property.

As it is very clear from above point of view that price of the room is one of the major elements so the manager should be very careful in terms of tariff fixation (The term tariff means the rate which when applied to rooms of a hotel it means room rate).Hotel tariff or room  rate  fixation  is  a  difficult  task  as  the  room  rates  are  both  quantifiable  and qualifiable. Therefore the basis of charging the room rates varies from hotels to hotels.

## 5.3.1 Approaches for Setting Room Rates

The rate of a hotel room should be based on the competition in the market, cost involved, standard of services and amenities offered by the hotel, the profile of the guest, location of the hotel, location of the room etc.

The common approaches to deciding room tariff are given as below:

-  Cost based pricing
-  Market based pricing

MARKET BASED PRICING: Market based pricing is  deciding  a price based on the value of the product in the perception or terms of the customer. The concept is based on an  idea  of  what  the  ultimate  customer  is  ready  to  pay  i.e.  what  he  is  willing  to  pay becomes the starting point. In that case, the hotel works backwards as it first makes an accommodation product available at a price that a guest is willing to pay, and then it tries to work on the cost in such a manner that a hotel receives a reasonable rate of return on that manner.

This approach can also be called as common sense approach. As management surveys the market and check other comparable hotels in the market and sees what they are charging for the same product. The approach behind this concept is that the hotel can charge only what the market willing to accept, and this is usually controlled by the competition.

There  are  many  problems  in  this  approach,  firstly  in  case  of  new  property,  the construction and other cost will be more in the beginning than those of the competitors thus  the  hotel  cannot  be  as  profitable  as  the  competitors  initially.  Second,  with  the property being new and having newer amenities, the value of property to guests can be more than the competitors. The market condition approach is fully a marketing approach that allows the local market to determine the rate. The market approach is further divided into:

-  On  the  basis  of  Competitive  Pricing :  Charging  as  according  to  what  the competitor is charging.
-  On the basis of Follow the leader Pricing : Charges of the room similar to what the major and dominant hotel in the area charges
-  On the basis of Prestige Pricing : to keep the highest rate in the area and justify it with better product, better service levels, etc
-  On the basis  of    Discount  pricing :  also  called  as  rate  cutting  ie  reducing  the rates or prices of the room lower than that of the surrounding competitors there by bringing the increase in occupancy, especially done during off seasons.
-  Inclusive and non inclusive rates or On the basis of meal plans :  Hotels  also charge room rates on the basis of different meal plans provided or not provided along with the room to guest like CP/MP/AP basis.
-  On the basis of Guest requirements :  Charging  room rates as  according to  the different  requirements  of  the  guest  eg  offering,  long  staying  guest  on  AP  basis while early check in on CP basis.
-  On the basis of Market tolerance :  Competing hotels are being checked to find out the best available for a room. These rates can be found out by calling the other competing hotels without disclosing your identity.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

COST BASED PRICING: Cost based pricing is a room rent determination techniques that cover the basic cost of operations at a given level of service plus the predetermined percentage of return on investment.

It involves that managers should first calculate all the fixed and variable cost associated with the hotel and once calculated than desired profit margin is added to each unit such as 5 to 10%mark up. The goal of cost oriented approach is to cover all the cost incurred in producing or delivering the product or services and to achieve a targeted level of profit.

## Formula can be

## Selling Price      =          Cost     +     Fixed Profit Percentage

This  method  is  simple  as,  it  requires  only  the  study  of  the  hotel's  financial  and accounting  records  to  determine  prices.  It  does  not  took  into  consideration  the competition and other factors that might have an impact on pricing. Cost oriented pricing is popular as it requires internal information which can be calculated easily and besides that they can justify the prices as it took into consideration cost plus a mark up for profit.

The following are the two widely used cost based pricing techniques:

- 1. Rule of thumb approach
- 2. Hubbart Formula

The Rule of Thumb: This is one of the traditional methods of tariff fixation used in the hotel for fixing the price of the room, according to this approach the room rate is fixed at Rs. 1 for each Rs. 1000 which is been spent on the construction and furnishing of the room assuming 70 % occupancy for the year. This is also called as cost rate formula.

For example, assume that the average construction and furnishing cost of a hotel room is Rs. 50,00,000/- the average rack rate of hotel room in this hotel using thumb rule will be Rs. 5000, as illustrated below.

1000              :       1

50, 00,000    :      5000

Thus in this approach only the cost incurred at the time of starting the operation is only considered and if we try to know the room rent after 20 years of its operation the rate would come the same as (Rs1 For Rs 1000) though the cost of operations would have increased manifold. This is one of the major drawback of this approach and some other draw backs are:

-  This  approach  did  not  consider  the  factors  like  inflation,  competition,  fixed expenses etc and only the cost of constructing a room is kept in mind.
-  This approach consider the average occupancy to be70% which is not achieved by  many  hotels  due  to  several  reasons  thus  hotels  expecting  lower  occupancy should set a higher rate to attain same revenue.

-  The return on Investment is not considered.
-  It even not considers the depreciation of fixed assets and elevation of land cost.
-  To establish the hotel requires large sum of money, which is generated through borrowing from family, friends, financial institution and public through sale of shares and debentures. The owner of the hotel has to pay the debts and interest on the  sum  received  irrespective  of  the  condition  of  the  hotel  this  factor  is  not consider in this approach
-  The hotel business may have to face some unavoidable and unexpected expenses, the provision for which is not mentioned in this approach.
-  The  rule  of  thumb  approach  for  pricing  rooms  rates  also  fails  to  take  into consideration the revenue generated from other sources ie facilities and services provided  by  the  hotel,  eg  hotel  generates  revenue  from  sources  like  food  and beverage, conference, laundry, telephone etc so it must be a part of calculation while deciding room tariff for the hotel.

The Hubbart Formula: As rule of thumb approach was an traditional way of calculating the room rent and also has several drawback so a new approach was developed called as The Hubbart formula, which is more scientific way of fixing the room rent, and it was developed  by  Roy  Hubbart  in  America  in  the  1940s  taking  in  calculation  -  operating expenses, room sales, and pre-desired return on investment, which helped to resolves all the problems of the thumb rule approach.

𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑹𝒆𝒏𝒕 = 𝑹𝑶𝑰  +  𝑶𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒆𝒙𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒆𝒔 -  𝑵𝒐𝒏 𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝒓𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒓𝒐𝒐𝒎𝒔 𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒅 𝒑𝒆𝒓 𝒅𝒂𝒚 𝑿 𝟑𝟔𝟓

The  Hubbart  formula  is  also  called  as  -bottom-up‖  approach  as  it  requires  one  to completely  reverse  the  income  statement  from  the  bottom  up.  Using  the  bottom-up approach,  you  begins  with  calculating  the  desired  net  income  which  is  based  on  the owner's desired return on investment (ROI) and the income statement by adding back estimated taxes, non-operating expenses, and undistributed operating expenses and then subtracting out estimated operated departments income (excluding rooms). This will lead to the result which will be the estimated operated department income for rooms. Next, you  can  separate  the  estimated  operated  department  income  for  rooms  into  rooms revenue  and  rooms  expenses.    Once  rooms  expenses  are  subtracted  than  only,  rooms revenue will remain. This revenue can then be again divided into number of rooms to be sold and, finally, ADR. The resulting ADR is the average price that should be charged for your rooms in order to achieve the owner's desired net income (ROI).

STEPS: The  following  steps  are  involved  in  calculating  the  room  rent  according  to Hubbart formula :

Step  1 :  Calculate  the  total  investment  including  the  owner's  capital  and  loans. Once total investment is known, calculate hotel's desired profit by multiplying the desired rate of return (ROI)  by the owner's investment.

Step  2 : Calculate  the  total  expanses  like  operating  expenses,  overhead, depreciation  of  fixed  assets,  interest  paid,  taxes  sand  insurances  etc  that  will happen during hotel operations.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

- Step 3 : Combine the step 1 and 2 to calculate the gross operating income that covers the operating cost, investment and ROI.
- Step  4: Next  calculate  the  income  generated  from  other  sources  of  hotel  revenue producing areas like food and beverage sales, laundry etc. Subtract the same from the amount calculate in step from 3 so as to get the profit from the room sales. This will give the total revenue from room sales.
- Step 5 : Calculate the total number of guest rooms available for stay by multiplying the total  number  of  rooms  with  no  of  days  in  the  year.  Make  the  provision  for  expected average  vacancy  that  is  expected  during  the  year.  This  step  will  provide  total  no  of rooms available for sale.
- Step 6 : Divide the revenue generation result fromstep4bythetotal number of rooms from step 5theresultobtainedwillbeaveragedaily rate which will be average daily rate covering the cost of operation and fair return on investment.

In summaries and numerical form the above steps can be:

- 1) Total Investment                 =    Owners Capital +Loans

Return on investment (ROI)    =    Total investment X Return Percentage

- 2) Total Expenses
- =     operating expenses

(Include  expenses  directly  associated  with  selling  and  cleaning  rooms  and  providing food services)

- + Taxes and insurance
- + Interest paid on loans
- + Depreciation on book value
- 3) Gross Operating Revenue =      Total Expenses+ ROI
- 4)  Calculate  non-rooms  income: Hotel  can make profit from food &beverage dept. or from telephone toll charges or laundry.
- 5)  Revenue to be generated by room = Gross Operating Revenue -Revenue generated from    other sources (e.g. food &beverage sales, laundry, rent and lease of the hotel area, fitness centre etc)
- 6) Calculate total no of room available during the year=Total no of room in the hotel x No of days in the year

Make the provision for expected average vacancy that is expected during the year. This step will provide total no of rooms with the no of days in the year.

- 7) Average daily rate        =

Revenue generation from room Total No of rooms

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

For Example : Hotel ‗XYZ' having 60 rooms is constructed at a project cost of Rs 10 crores. The owner's capital is Rs. 8 crores on which he is expecting 20 % ROI while the remaining capital is arranged through a bank loan at an interest rate of 15% per annum. The income tax rate is  30  %  and  the  hotel  is  expected  to  make  60%  occupancy.  The operating expenses are estimated to be Rs. 2 crores while the hotel is expecting Rs. 1 crores as non room revenue in the first year of its operation. Calculate Average rack rate with the use of Hubbart formula

Solution : Desired ROI- Rs. 80000000 x 20 % = 16000000

Total room nights = 24 x 365 = 8760

Total expenses = Rs. 20000000 + 6000000 ( bank interest) = 26000000

Non room revenue = Rs. 10000000

Pre- tax income -     30 x 16000000      = 6857143

70

6857143 + 16000000 = 22857143 /-

## 22857143 + 26000000 - 10000000

8760

- =    Rs. 5643 /is estimated as average rack rate for the hotel as per Hubbart formula.

## Hubbart formula is useful because

- 1. It helps in providing an adequate return to the hotel's owner.
- 2. It helps in Recovering the hotel's non operating expenses
- 3. It helps in covering the hotel's fixed cost.
- 4. It takes into consideration the hotels operating cost
- 5. It takes into consideration all the hotel's non -room income (or loss)
- 6. Result in a definite and justifiable rate goal or overall ADR goal.

The Hubbart formula was criticized for  based  on  assumptions  about  the  non  important owner's desired ROI and the need to know expenses that are affected by the quality of the hotel's  management.    Another  criticism  is  that  the  formula  requires  the  room  rate  to compensate for operating losses incurred by other areas (such as from telecommunications).

The  formula's  primary  shortcoming  may  relate  to  identifying  the  number  of  rooms forecasted to be sold.  The number of rooms sold is dependent, to a significant degree, on

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

the rate charged for the rooms. However, the Hubbart formula requires that the number of rooms sold be estimated prior to knowing the rate at which they would sell.

## 5.3.2 Type of Room Rates

Room rates are of two types:

-  Rack Rate
-  Discounted Rate

Rack Rate: It refers to the actual or normal room rates of the hotel room. Hotel generally fixes a standard rate for each of the category of rooms offered to guests. In olden days, a wooden rack or rate board was placed near the room rack in the lobby or at the reception, hence the name is placed rack rate. This is the rate which is published on the tariff card of the hotel and is without any discount is known as the Rack rate. In general, rack rate may be termed as the MRP of a hotel room.

Discounted Rate: To attract  and  motivate  the  guest  to  provide  regular  business  to  the hotel and also to compete in the market, hotels offer different types of discounted room tariff.  Discounted  tariff  are  always  lower  than  the  rack  rate.  Sometimes  hotels  offer discounts to guest to please him for a  courtesy  as it is  expected that  the  guest  may  be sending lot of business to the hotel in future. Some of these discounted rates are given as below:

-  Corporate Rate
-  Regular corporate rate
-  CGVR
-  Seasonal rate
-  Advance Purchase Rate
-  Week Day /Weekend Rate
-  Day and Half Day Rate
-  Group Rate
-  Tour Group
-  Travel Agent rate
-  Airline rate
-  Government rate
-  Educational Rate
-  Membership Rate
-  Introductory rate
-  Crib Rate
-  Complimentary rate
-  Package Rate

Corporate Rate : To attract the corporate market segment, corporate discount on the rates are offered to companies and corporate houses which is usually 10-15% discount on the rack rate  are  offered.  Now  a  day's  various  MNCs  organize  residential  conferences  and training programs at different destinations away from their work places and hotels wants to cash these opportunities so they tries to lure the corporate houses   by offering them different discounted rates.

Generally corporate rate is of two types:

- i. Regular  corporate  rate: It  is  a  unilateral  offer  ie  when  hotels offers  a  fixed  percentage  of  discount  without  any  commitment from the corporate house to provide regular business to hotel it is known as regular corporate rate.
- ii. CGVR :  It  stands  for company  guaranteed  volume  rate .  It's  a bilateral contract between the hotel and the corporate house. In this case hotels offer a higher discount compared to regular corporate rate but on a condition that company will give a guaranteed volume of business during the year.

Seasonal Rate : Seasonal and resort hotels usually have fluctuating demand ie they have a very clear peak season, mid season / shoulder period and off season depending upon their locality and interest of guest Destinations like hill stations, beaches and resorts etc receive heavy traffic during particular period of the year: the rest of the year is the lean period in terms tourism. Therefore when the tourist traffic is more at a particular place is known as peak  season  hotels  do  not  offer  any  discount  and      they  charge  rack  rate  during  peak season  and  sometimes  even  more  than  the  rack  rate  known  as  seasonal  rates,  and  as tourist traffic drops down, to attract the tourist hotels offer discounted rates to the guest known  as  off  season  rates  Hotels  in  these  locations  mention  their  seasonal  and  off seasonal rates clearly on the traffic card rates.

Advance Purchase Rate: The concept is more popular in the airline industry, and is a relatively new concept in the hospitality industry. It gives heavy discount on room rates when room booking are done in advance. The rate of discount depends upon the advance time period and the number of rooms available at the time of booking ie a hotel may give discount  for  a  room  that  is  booked  in  advance  as  compared  to  a  room  that  is  booked fifteen day in advance, The advance booking of rooms ensure the revenue in future and thereby helps in future planning and revenue management

Week Day /Weekend Rate : Some hotels have a fluctuation in their occupancy level with regard to the days of the week .The demand for rooms in such hotels may be more on certain days in a week like: Business hotels have to face low occupancy on weekends as most  of  the  establishments  and  offices  are  closed  on  weekends,  therefore  to  attract business  on  weekend,  special  discounted  rates  are  offered  by  these  hotels  to  the  guest while. Resorts close to the cities will offer a discounted rate on week days compared to the weekends as the demand for room is higher on weekends. Thus Hotels analyses their demand levels over a period of time and fix higher rates during demand period and lower room rates during low demand period.

Day And Half Day Rate: These rates are charged from the guest who are not going to stay overnight in the hotel, and are always lower than the rack rate of the hotel, for e.g. if the guest checks in at 10am and checks out the same evening at a t around 5pm he may be charged the day rate .Sometimes a guest may wish to stay for a very short duration of the time,  not  exceeding  five  hours.  Then  he  is  charged  Half  Day  Rate  which  is  generally more than the numerical half of the rack rate. For eg A guest has to catch a flight after

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

few  hours  and  in  meantime  he  wants  to  relax  in  the  hotel  from  such  guest  half  day charges are charged.

Group  Rate :  10  or  more  than  ten  persons  travelling  together  forms  or  are  known  as group. Group tariff is lower than the rack rate because it gives bulk business to the hotel so a hotel offers discounted rates to group. Group rates are generally negotiable on the basis  of  the  size  of  group,  length  of  stay,  past  relationship  with  the  group  operator, season, etc.

Tour Group: These are the highly discounted rates given to a wholesaler who operates a series of tours groups arriving and departing together. E.g. A tour operator may conduct a week's  tour  of  the  Golden  Triangle  (Delhi-Agra-Jaipur)  on  the  4th,  14th  and  24th  of every  month  for  groups  of  20  persons.  He  gives  guarantees  to  the  hotel  that  he  would provide this series of business every month for a period of 1year.

Travel Agent Rate : Travel agents are those who sell travel products like hotel rooms, airline booking etc. on a commission basis to the guest, and as they provide a substantial volume of  Business  to  hotels  also  so  in  return  hotels  offers  them  special  discount  and commission etc. Thus taking commission or special favors from both the hotels and guest. They are like a retail shop of tourism industry. Usually 10 % commission is offered to the travel agents for the business provided by them.  They are also offered a discounted rate so that they publicize the hotel product in the market, ahead of their competition which is also being marketed by them. eg. are Cox & Kings, Thomas Cook

Airline Rate : These are the special discounted rates offered to crew members of one or more airlines generally offered by airport hotels or the transit hotels as they give they give business in the form of stay of their crew members or layover passengers throughout the year on a consistent and continuous basis.

Government Rate: Government employees generally travels for official work, and they are paid allowance to cover their hotel, fooding  and travelling expanses thus some hotels offer them a rate which give them room and accommodation with in that price.

Educational  Rate: Educational  rates  are  special  rates  by  hotels  to  students  and educationists who have a limited travel budget. They are significant sources of business because of their large number and frequency of visits

Membership Rate: Membership rates  are  offered  to  those  guest  who  are  members  of influential  organizations  that  provide  heavy  volume  of  business  to  hotels  .The membership  rates  are  generally  much  lower  than  the  rack  rates  and  may  also  include discount  on  food  &  beverage  Special  discount  rates  are  given  to  FHRAI  member (Federation of hotels and restaurants association of India) is a trade association which is a representative  body  of  hospitality  industry  in  India  )-  FHRAI  card  holder  gets  a  fixed discount in all member hotels which is 30% on Room, F & B, and Laundry.

Introductory  Rate :  New  hotels  generally  offers  special  discounted  rate  during  their initial  months so as to attract the business and to familiarize the guest and market with their hotel.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

Crib Rate: This is the rate charged for children above five years and below age of 12 years, who are accompanying their parents. The hotels provide crib bed in the room for infants.

Complimentary  Rate :  When  any  room  is  offered  to  a  guest  without  any  charge  it  is known as complimentary rate. It is generally offered to a relative or friend of the owner, or to compensate for severe problems in services of the guest, or as a reward to a regular guest or during FAM Tour/familiarity tours to develop good opinion about the hotel such as travel writes, food critics, travel agency heads, etc. Another term is House Use When the room is given without any charges to a person who is staying in the hotel for hotel's own use ie it may be in the case of a resident manager or manager on duty or a technician who is staying the hotel for some kind of repair and maintenance work than it is called house use.

Package Rate: A package offered by the hotel for a combination of one or more hotel product  or  services.  Also  called  bundling.  Package  rate  may  include  room  rent,  meals, special arrangement and may also include products and services offered by other service providers like transportation (rail, road and air) sightseeing's and so on.

A package rate is more economical and cheap for the guest than the individual purchase of each of the product and services while on behalf of hotels it act as a marketing strategy to  sell  the  slow  moving  item  along  with  the  hot  selling  items  of  the  hotel,  also  when products and services are sold in bunch it save the individual advertisement cost of the hotel and the money thus saved by the hotel is passed to guest in the form of lower prices.

The hotel may offer the following package:

-  Meeting Package
-  Meal Package
-  Marriage Package
-  Holiday Package

## 5.4 Forecasting

One of the most important task performed by the front office manger involves forecasting demand for the hotels guestroom, these forecast  if accurately done can be very effective in maintain the room and revenue management.

According to Dictionary forecast means -to say what will probably happen in future‖, i.e. -forecasting  is  a  technique  to  estimate  about  the  future,  based  on  historical  figures, expectations, trends, and/or experience, a certain value of an uncontrollable variable for a certain future period of time.

From the above definition it is clear that to forecast one requires to analyze and study the past records and demands, but, it cannot be as simple as it sound by coming up with a figure,  only  by  considering  the  historical  data's  or  figures,  without  adjusting  to  other variables  like  competition,  image  and  risk  of  the  country,  interest  rates,  inflation,

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

exchange rates, and other economical factors etc. Therefore, a person who forecasts shall adjust  the  forecasted  figure  to  the  today's  realities  and  expectations  before  forecasting anything.

## 5.4.1  Importance of Forecasting

Forecasting plays a very important role in the future planning, benefits of forecasting in the hotel industry are:

- 1. It  helps  the  reservation  manager to project the future volume of business and the revenue that would be generated by the hotel.
- 2. Staff requirement in each department for smooth functioning of the hotel.
- 3. Minimum inventory required by each, department for the smooth functioning of the hotel.
- 4. Allocation of resources to serve the guests in the hotel in the best possible way.
- 5. Maintenance and replacement required by the furniture, fixtures and finally by the property.
- 6. Special  arrangements  to  be  made  for  the  guest  especially  for  groups, commercially important people (C.I.P's) and VIP's.
- 7. The reservation forecast will provide the necessary data to the FOM so as to practice Yield Management.
- 8. Forecasting provides information about the lean days when occupancy is low so  that  the  sales  department  may  take  necessary  action  to  attract  business during that period.
- 9. The  forecast  data  also  give  information  about  the  sold  out  dates,  so  that  the reservation agent does not accept any reservation for those dates.
- 10. Forecasting also helps in taking selective overbooking.

## 5.4.2   Information Required for Forecasting

A forecast  can  serve  as  a  guide  in  determining  operational  cost  and  thus  every  effort should be made to ensure accurate forecasting, as it is a difficult skill to develop and can be  acquired  with  experience,  effective  record  keeping  and  accurate  calculations. Therefore experienced FOM's have found out that several types of information need to know  or  should  be  aware  of  before  making  the  room  availability  forecast.  These information are as follows:

- 1. Thorough and detailed knowledge of the hotel and surroundings areas
- 2. Market profile of the people to whom the hotel provides services
- 3. Occupancy data for the past several months and for the same period of the previous year
- 4. Reservation trends and history of reservation lead time between expected date of arrival and date of reservation also called reservation horizon
- 5. A list of special events scheduled in the geographical area
- 6. Business profile of specific groups booked for the forecasted data
- 7. Number of Non guaranteed and guaranteed reservations and estimate of no snows
- 8. The percentage of rooms already reserved, cut off dates for rooms blocks held in the forecasted dates

- 9. Impact of hotel groups and their potential influence on the forecasted dates
- 10. Plan of renovating the hotel that would change the number of rooms available for sale
- 11. Construction or renovating plans for competitive hotels in the area.

## 5.4.3 Forecasting Methods /Techniques

There  are  several  forecasting  methods  or  techniques  ranging  from  the  common  and simple method of using last year's actual figures as the forecasting tool for the coming year's numbers to complex approaches such as econometric.

<!-- image -->

Forecast methods are divided into:

- 1. Judgmental/ Qualitative method
- 2. Statistical/Quantitative method

Judgmental  /  Qualitative  method: These  types  of  forecasting  methods  are  based  on judgments,  opinions,  intuition,  emotions,  or  personal  experiences  and  are  therefore subjective in nature. They do not rely on any rigorous mathematical computations. Types of Qualitative Method are:

-  Expert Opinion
-  Market survey
-  Delphi Technique
-  Scenario Building

Expert  Opinion: In  this  technique  group  of  managers  meet,  discuss  and  collectively develop a forecast.

Market Survey: The approach that uses interviews and surveys to judge preferences of customer and to assess demand

Delphi  Technique: It  is  a  systematic  interactive  forecasting  method  for  obtaining forecasts  from  a  panel  of  independent  experts,  .the  selected  experts    answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round facilitator provides an summary of the expert's forecast from the different rounds as well as the reason they provided for

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

their judgments, thus participants are given the chance to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other member of the group, it is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will finally reach towards the correct answer and finally the process is stopped after the number of rounds and after reaching consensus stability of result and the mean or median scores of the final round gives the result.  In  short  it  can  also  be  called  as  approach  in  which  forecast  decision  is  taken through consensus agreement reached among a group of experts

Scenario Building: It is the process of analyzing all possible future events by taking into consideration all  alternative  possible  outcomes  or  scenarios,  the  analysis  is  designed  to allow improved decision making by allowing more complete consideration of outcomes and their implications.

Statistical  /Quantitative  Method: These  types  of  forecasting  methods  are  based  on mathematical  (quantitative)  models,  and  are  objective  in  nature.  They  rely  heavily  on mathematical computations. In the scope of this very course, Rooms Division Managers forecast mainly Room Demand for a future period of time measured either in:

-  Number of Rooms
-  Number of Room Nights
-  Number of Guest Nights
-  Room Nights = Occupancy Rate * Hotel Rooms * Average Length of Stay
-  Guest Nights = Occupancy Rate * Hotel Rooms * Average Guest per Room

Forecasting demand in room nights and/or guest nights is a better measurement compared to  number  of  rooms.  For,  room  nights  and  /or  guest  nights  underlies  more  than  one demand dimension at the same time and hence is more meaningful. Types of Quantitative Method are:

-  Percentage growth period
-  Moving average period
-  Weighted average period and others like Regression analysis, econometrics etc that are more complicated
- 1. Percentage Growth Method :  The assumption according to this method is that data available follows either an increasing or decreasing trend. Therefore this method shall be used  for  forecasting,  only  when  data  matches  this  assumption.  Percentage  growth between two periods i.e. first & the last year, is identified and applied to the previous year of the year for which forecasts are to be made.
- 2. Moving Average Method : The Moving Average Method similar to the -Percentage Growth Method‖ assumes an increasing or decreasing trend. This forecasting technique aims at smoothing data and adjusts it as to minimize volatility reflected in a high standard deviation between different records in the same data range.

The most common used moving average is the Double moving average, which calculates a  third  column  by  taking  averages  of  couples  of  any  two  successive  years,  Later,  the

percentage growth method would be applied to the smoothed data, Lastly, come up with the forecasted value:

- 3. Weighted  Average  Method : The  Weighted  Average  Method  assigns  Certain Importance  Factor  or  Coefficient  to  each  historical  Value.  Later,  the  forecasted  value shall  be  computed  by  dividing  the  weighted  data  to  its  coefficients  by  the  sum  of coefficients.
-  Assigning  weights  or  coefficients  is  and  art  that  depends  on  experience, thorough  analysis  of  past  figures,  and  performances.  Yet,  whatsoever coefficients  chosen,  there  is  always  a  certain  subjectivity  factor  that  might affect eventually the forecasted figure!
-  One of the most common types of the weighted average method is the simplest method,  which  assigns  the  lowest  weight  to  the  oldest  data  in  a  sequential order.
-  Though the simplest weighted average method is straight forward, assigning least weight to oldest data assumes that:
-  The factors that affects the oldest demand diminishes through time and hence are not important as far as the future period to be forecasted is concerned
-  The factors and hence the conditions that created the last period's demand are assumed to continue heavily playing an important role in the next period to be forecasted!
-  Since  the  above  mentioned  assumptions  might  not  be  valid,  in  most  of  the cases,  hotels  shall  adjust  the  coefficients  attributed  in  the  simplest  weighted average method in a way that mostly puts more weight on factors thought to affect  next  period's  demand  and  less  weight  to  those  which  would  be considered relatively unimportant!!
-  Another possibility is that hotels shall, after finding a forecast from the simple weighted average method, adjust to experience, trends, and fact.
- 4. Time Series Analysis : The Time Series Method tries through Regression Analysis to come up with a Line that minimizes the distance between any Actual Point on the Curve and  its  Corresponding  Point  on  the  Line  (Least  Square  Method).  This  Technique  is refereed to as the Regression Analysis. After finding the Equation of the Line (i.e. f (x) = y    =  a  *  x  +  b),  we  try  to  forecast  the  independent  Variable.  Managers  shall  use forecasting methods with extreme precautions, and shall consider first the assumptions underlying each Forecasting Method to be able to find a good forecast. After running a statistical forecast, managers shall adjust it to trends, expectations, and opinion surveys. (I.e. shall consider judgmental forecasting)

## 5.4. 4 Forecasting Room Availability

Availability of room is the actual or projected number of rooms that are still not occupied or reserved on a given date. Because rooms continually turn over, it becomes non feasible to  calculate  the  exact  number  of  rooms  that  will  be  unoccupied.  A  room  availability report is based on an estimate calculated with the help of information available from past reservations  and  occupancy.  Following  information  is  required  to  prepare  an  accurate room availability report.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

Room Inventory - : It  is  the  total  number  of  rooms  that  could  possibly  be  sold  on  a given date is called is called room inventory. The inventory does not include rooms that are  out  of  order  for  maintenance  or  redecoration  or  rooms  that  are  currently  under construction.

Previous Night Occupancy -  :  It  is  the  total  numbers of rooms that were occupied by the guest on the previous night.

Departures: A departure are those guest who are scheduled or planned to be check out on the current date.

Reservations - : This report must take into consideration the total numbers of rooms for which reservations have been received for the current date.

Under Stay : - : Those guest who were actually supposed to stay in the hotel but checked out before their scheduled departure date due to any reason is called under stay.

Over  Stay: -  :Those  guest  who  stays  or  remains  in  the  hotel  beyond  the  scheduled departure date is called over stay.

Cancellation: - :Those reservations which were made by the guest but are canceled due to some  reasons.

No-Shows  -  : Besides  cancellation  there  is  a  small  percentage  of  people  who  make reservations  and  never  check  -  in.  The  average  number  show  rate  is  about  5%  of reservations.

Early arrivals: - : There are chances also that a guest will check in prior to the estimated arrival date.

## 5.4.5   Data Required for Forecasting Room Availability

Forecasting Room Availability process generally based on historical occupancy data. To facilitate forecasting, the following daily occupancy data should be collected:

-  No. of expected room arrivals
-  No. of expected room walk-ins
-  No. of expected room stayovers (rooms occupied on previous nights that'll continue to be occupied for the night in question)
-  No. of expected room no-shows
-  No. of expected room under stays
-  No. of expected room check-outs
-  No. of expected room overstays

These data's are important for forecasting the room availability. Since they are used for calculating  several  daily  operating  ratios  that  help  to  identify  the  room  position.  Most statistical  ratios(mathematical  expression  of  a  relationship  between  two  numbers  that

result from dividing one by the other) that apply to Front Office operations are expressed as  percentages.  Managers  should  look  for  consistency  in  these  ratios  as  without consistency  in  forecasting  ratios  the  evaluation  of  the  hotels  performance  will  be difficult.

## 5.4.6   Useful Forecasting Data

The following ratios and percentages are useful for the FOM for forecasting:

Percentage  of  No  Shows: The  percentage  of  no  shows  indicates  the  proportion  of reserved rooms that were booked for the guest but the expected guests did not arrive to occupy  the  reserved  rooms  on  the  expected  date  of  arrival.  This  ratio  helps  the  front office  manager  to  decide  when  and  if  the  rooms  can  be  sold  to  walk  in  guests.  The percentage of no shows is calculated by dividing  the number of rooms no show for a specific  period  of  time  by  the  total  number  of  expected  rooms  arrivals  for  that  same period.

𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝑵𝒐 𝑺𝒉𝒐𝒘𝒔 = 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝒐𝒇 𝑵𝒐 𝑺𝒉𝒐𝒘𝒔 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑹𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔

Some hotel's FOM also keep in mind reservation in terms of the guaranteed and non guaranteed reservations, as non guaranteed reservations typically have a higher chances of    no  show  percentage  than  guaranteed  reservations  since  the  potential  guest  do  not have any obligation to pay if they do not register at the hotel. Proper forecasting of no shows rooms also depends on the hotels mix of business. For E.g.: corporate groups have a  generally  much  lower  no  show  percentage  that  other  type  of  groups  or  FIT's  or individual businesses.

Percentage  of  Walk-ins: The  percentage  of  walk-ins  is  calculated  by  dividing  the number of occupied rooms by walk-in guest by the total number of rooms' arrivals for the same period.

𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝒘𝒂𝒍𝒌 𝒊𝒏 = 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝒘𝒂𝒍𝒌 𝒊𝒏 𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑨𝒓𝒓𝒊𝒗𝒂𝒍𝒔

Walk-ins  guest  generally  occupy  those  rooms  available  that  are  kept  for  guests  with reservations but they have not come (cancel or no-show), therefore hotels can sell those rooms  to  walk  -in's  guest  at  a  higher  rate,  as  these  guests  have  less  opportunity  to consider  the  alternate  property.   A  walk-in  guest  room  sale  thereby  helps  the  hotel  to improve both its occupancy and room revenues.  However, from a planning perspective, it is generally considered better to have reservations in advance than to rely on walk-in business.

Percentage of Overstay: Overstay rooms represents those rooms which are occupied by those  guests  who  wants  to  stay  beyond  or  more  than  their  expected  departure  dates. Overstay  guests  may  have  arrived  with  guaranteed  reservations  or  non  guaranteed reservations or as walk in's.

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

The percentage of overstay is calculated by dividing the number of overstay rooms by expected room departures for the same period.

𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒚 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎

## 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝑶𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒚 = 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒆𝒙𝒑𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒄𝒌𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒔

Where the number of expected check outs equal to the number of the actual check outs minus under stays plus overstays. To help regulate room overstays the Front desk agents are  trained  to  verify  the  arriving  guest's  departure  date  at  the  time  of  check  in.  Such verification can be critical especially when the hotel is at or near a full occupancy and there are no provisions for overstaying the guest.

Percentage of Under stay: Under stay represents rooms occupied by guest who checks out before their scheduled departure date. Under say guests may arrive at the hotel with guaranteed reservation or as walk in guest. The percentage of under say is calculated by dividing the number of under stay rooms for a period by total number of departure rooms for the same period.

## 𝑷𝒆𝒓𝒄𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝑼𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒚 = 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝑼𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒚 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑵𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒆𝒙𝒑𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒄𝒌𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒔

Guest when leave before their expected date of departure creates empty rooms which are difficult to fill in the last moments thereby leading to loss of room revenue As under stay rooms  represent  permanent  loss  of  room  revenue,  while,  overstays  may  boost  room revenues. It is a privilege when the hotel is having low occupancy In order to regulate both, front office staff should:

-  Confirm or reconfirm guest's Date of Departure  at the time of registration
-  Present  an  alternate  guestroom  reservation  form  to  registered  guest  to overstay guests
-  Review guest history
-  Contact  potential  overstay  guests,  especially  those  who  have  not  left  by check-out time

## 5.4.7 Forecast formula

Once the FOM is ready with the statistics, the number of rooms available for sale on any given date can be calculated by using the following formula:

Total Number of guest room

- (-) Number of out order rooms
- (-) Number of rooms reservation
- (+) Number of  rooms reservations (x) % of  no show
- (-)Number of rooms over stays

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Number of rooms available for sale

Note  that  this  formula  does  not  include  walk-ins.   They  are  not  included  because  the number of walk-ins a hotel can accept is determined by the number of rooms that remain

available  for  sale.   If  a  hotel  is  full  due  to  existing  reservations,  stay  over  and  other factors.  It will not accept walk-ins.

As an example, consider the hotel is a 140 room property where on April 20th there are 5 out of order rooms and 55stay over.  On that day, there are 42 guests with reservations scheduled to arrive since the percentage of no-show has been recently calculated at 18.06 % the front office manager calculates that as many as 8 guests with reservation may not arrive (42 x .1806=7.59, rounded to 8).  Based on historical data, 6 under stays and 15 over stays are also expected.  The number of rooms projected to be available for sale on April 20th can be determined as follows.

| Total number of guest rooms                               | 140      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| ( - ) Number of out of order rooms                        | (-)  5   |
| ( - ) Number of stay over                                 | (-) 55   |
| ( - ) Number of room reservation                          | (-) 42   |
| ( + ) Number of room reservation X  Percentage of No Show | (+) 8    |
| ( + ) Number of rooms under stay                          | (+)  6   |
| ( - ) Number of rooms over stays                          | (-)  15  |
| = Number of rooms available for sale                      | 39 rooms |

## 5.4.8  Types of Forecasting

The  accuracy  in  the  forecast  is  essential  because  it  is  the  main  element  of  the pricing/room allocation decisions; Forecasting is generally done by front office manager or by Revenue Manager and is done in different ways; few hotels use the manual excelbased  approach  for  forecasting,  while  others  use  automated  systems  called  Revenue Management systems. Many hotels have decided to have automated system so as to have accurate  forecasting  as  inaccurate  forecasting  leads  to  incorrect  decisions  and  severely affect revenues and profit margins. Accurate Forecasting is highly important for any hotel operations. Types of forecasting may be divided into three categories:

-  Occupancy Forecast: Revenue Manager predicts the occupancy level.
-  Demand Forecast: Revenue Manager produces the unconstrained demand for the hotel (hotel occupancy level if no restrictions on capacity and price is applied).
-  Revenue  Forecast: Revenue  Manager  estimates  the  revenue  to  be generated.

Different methods/approaches that are used by hotels to forecast demand; these can be divided into two categories: historical booking  models and advanced booking models. Historical booking models consider only the arrivals or the occupancy time series, and apply  time  series  models  on  these.  No  use  is  made  of  the  reservations  data.  The advanced booking approach, on the other hand, makes use of the reservations data, and utilizes  the  concept  of  "pick-up".  For  example,  most  major  hotel  chains  use  linear-

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

programming-based models that require detailed  forecasts  by  day  of  arrival,  length  of stay, and rate category. Hence, forecasting is estimated as such: a hypothetical automated system that scans historical bookings, occupancy patterns, internal and external events, and reservation and rates information and fits quantitative forecasting models to the data. Using the fitted models, the revenue management system arrives at predictions, which are then used as an input in making rate and allocation decisions. Thus, the accuracy of this forecasting tool boosts the hotel's revenues and profit margin.

Forecasting in the lodging industry has been relatively important based on the nature of industry  and  operational  characteristics  and  difficulties.  This  importance  is  not  only related  on  wide  demand  fluctuations,  but  also  the  efforts  to  increase  occupancy  rates, ADR and RevPar. The forecast is the most important driver of any revenue-management optimization  approach.  Hotels  should  forecast  at  a  detailed  level  if  the  true  benefits available from revenue optimization are to be achieved.

## 5.4. 9 Sample Forecast Forms

The front office may prepare several different forecasts forms, as per their requirements. Occupancy forecasts are typically developed on a monthly basis and reviewed by food and beverage and rooms division management to forecast revenues, project expenses, and develop labor schedules. A ten-day forecast, for example, may be used to update labor scheduling and cost projections and may later be supplemented by a more current threeday forecast. Together, these forecasts help many hotel departments maintain appropriate staff levels for expected business volumes and thereby help contain costs.

Ten-Day Forecast: In most of the properties, the ten-day forecast is prepared jointly by the front office manager and the reservations manager with the support of their forecast committee. Many properties develop their ten-day forecast from their yearly forecast. A ten-day forecast usually consists of:

-  Daily  forecasted  occupancy  figures,  including  room  arrivals,  room departures, rooms sold, and number of guests.
-  The number of group commitments, with a listing of each group's name, arrival and departure dates, number of rooms reserved, number of guests, and perhaps quoted room rates
-  A comparison of the previous period's forecasted and actual room counts and occupancy percentages

A  special  ten-day  forecast  can  also  be  prepared  for  food  and  beverage,  banquet,  and catering  operations.  This  forecast  generally  includes  the  expected  number  of  guests, which is often referred to as the house count. Sometimes the house count is divided into group  and  non-group  categories  so  that  the  hotel's  dining  room  managers  can  better understand the nature of their business and their staffing needs.

To help the other departments of the hotel to plan their staffing and payroll levels for the upcoming  period,  the  ten-day  forecast  should  be  prepared  and  distributed  to  all

department offices by mid-week for the coming period. This forecast can be especially helpful to the housekeeping department who has to keep the staff ready for the future requirements.  A  ten-day  forecast  form,  as  shown,  is  typically  developed  from  data collected through several front office sources.

Firstly,  the  current  number  of  occupied  rooms  is  reviewed.  The  estimated  numbers  of overstays  and  expected  departures  are  noted.  Next,  relevant  reservation  information  is evaluated  for  each  room  (and  guest)  by  date  of  arrival,  length  of  stay,  and  date  of departure.  These  counts  are  then  reconciled  with  reservation  control  data.  Then,  the actual  counts  are  adjusted  to  reflect  the  projected  percentage  of  no-shows,  anticipated under  stays,  and  expected  walk-ins.  These  projections  are  based  on  the  hotel's  recent history,  the  seasonality  of  its  business,  and  the  known  history  of  specific  groups scheduled to arrive. Finally, conventions and other groups are listed on the forecast to alert  various  department  managers  related  to  the  possible  periods  of  heavy,  or  light, check-ins and check-outs. The number of rooms assigned each day to each group may also be noted on the sheet.

Most computer systems software's are there to provide a summary of recorded data in a report  format  for  the  use  of  front  office  manager  but  these  are  unable  to  forecast business.  Programming  to  analyze  historical  trends  and  market  conditions  has  been attempted in the past but with little success. Therefore while the computer system can assist  in  forecasting,  it  is  the  knowledge,  and  skills  of  the  front  office  manager  that determines how accurate the forecast is.

Three-Day  Forecast : A  three-day  forecast  is  an  updated  report  that  reflects  a  more current estimate of room availability. It gives details of any significant changes from the ten-day  forecast.  The  three-day  forecast  is  prepared  to  help  management  in  proper planning and fine-tuning of labor schedules and adjusting room availability information.

Exhibit  shows  a  sample  three-day  forecast  form.  In  some  hotels,  a  brief  daily  revenue meeting is held to focus on occupancy and rate changes for the next few days. The results of this meeting are often included in the three-day forecast.

- 1. previous night occupied room is determined from either b the actual number ofroom occupied last night or the forecasted number of rooms from the previous night.
- 2.  unoccupied  rooms  equals  the  total  number  of  rooms  in  the  hotel  and  less  then  the number of rooms occupied.
- 3.  Expected  house  count  equals  the  forecasted  occupied  rooms  times  the  multiple occupancy percentage for the day.

## Three Day Forecast

Thirty day forecasts: In addition to the above forecast form, FOM may also maintain 30 day forecasts that are often outputs from budgeting process. Hotels generally creates an  annual  -  12  months  revenue  and  expanse  budget  in  monthly  increments,  so  the 30dayor monthly forecast is a common way to compare hotel's budget forecast with an occupancy or room revenue forecast.

Room Count Considerations: Control books, charts, software applications, projections, ratios, and formulas are essential for short- and long-range room count planning. Every day,  the  front  office  performs  several  physical  counts  of  rooms  occupied,  vacant, reserved,  and  due  to  check  out,  to  complete  the  occupancy  statistics  for  that  day.  A computerized system can reduce the need for most final counts, as these systems can be programmed to continually update room availability information. It is important for front desk  to  know exactly how many rooms are available, especially  if  the  hotel  wants  to operate  at  nearly  100  percent  occupancy.  Once  procedures  for  gathering  room  count information are established, planning procedures  can be extended to longer periods of time  to  form  a  more  reliable  basis  for  revenue,  expense,  and  labor  forecasting.  The Checklist in Exhibit may be applicable to non-automated and semi-automated operations alike.

## 5.5 Evaluating Front Office Operations

Evaluating and measuring the performance of a hotel is one of the important management functions as its investors, owners and manager's wants to assess the profitability, revenue generation from the hotel ie to know whether the front office is able to attain the goals which were planned earlier and also to decide for future.

Therefore  it  is  essential  to  have  thorough  evaluation  of  the  results  of  front  office operations  which  is  done  by  front  office  managers;  they  evaluate  the  results  of  the departmental activities on a daily, monthly, quarterly and yearly basis. Some major tools or factors which front office managers can use for evaluating front office operations and to evaluate the success of front office operations are:

-  The Daily Operations Report
-  Occupancy Ratios
-  Rooms Revenue Analysis
-  The Hotel Income Statement
-  The Rooms Schedule
-  Rooms Division Budget Reports
-  Operating Ratios
-  Ratio Standard

The Daily Operations Report : The daily operations report also known as the manager's report,  the  daily  report  or  the  daily  revenue  report;  have  the  summary  of  the  hotel's financial  activities  during  a  24-hour  period.  The  report  has  the  summary  of  cash reconciliation, bank accounts, revenue and accounts receivable. It also serves as a posting reference for various accounting journals and provides data that act as an input to link front  and  back  office  automated  functions.  The  copies  of  the  report  are  generally distributed to all department and division managers.

A room statistics and occupancy ratio from all the sections of the hotel becomes the part of  the  daily  operations  report  and  with  the  comments  and  observations  from  the accounting staff, statistics shown on the daily operations report makes it more meaningful for the manger's in identifying the problem and taking the right decision.  For example, if

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

the  statistics  shows  about  the  number  of  guests  using  the  hotel's  Gym  services  sale  is down while occupancy is up.  The front office manager may assume that the front office staff is not properly promoting available guest gym services.

Occupancy Ratios :  Occupancy ratios help in identifying that how successful the front office staff was in selling the hotel's primary product - guestrooms. The following room statistics must be collected to calculate basic occupancy ratios:

-  Number of rooms available for sale
-  Number of rooms sold
-  Number of guests
-  Number of guests per room
-  Net rooms revenue

Generally, these data's are also available on the daily operations report.  Occupancy ratios that can be calculated from these data include occupancy percentage, multiple (or double) occupancy ratio, average daily rate, revenue per available room (Rev PAR), revenue per available  customer  (Rev  PAC),  and  average  rate  per  guest. Occupancy  percentage  and average daily rate may also be available on a property's daily operations report.  These ratios typically are calculated on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis.

The night  auditor collects  occupied rooms data  and calculates occupancy  ratios for the front office manager, and later on with its help, FOM analyzes the given information to identify trends, patterns, or problems.  When analyzing the information, the front office

manager must take into consideration how different conditions can affect occupancy.

-For  example,  as  multiple  occupancy  increases,  the  average  daily  room  rate  may  also increase.  This is because, when a room is sold to more than one person, the room rate for two people in a room is usually not twice the rate for one person, the average room rate per guest decreases.

Occupancy Percentage: This  is  the  most  commonly  used  operating  ratio  in  the  front office, Occupancy percentage indicates the number of rooms either sold or occupied to the number of rooms available during a specific period of time.  Where some hotels use the number of rooms sold to calculate this percentage, while other hotels use the number of  rooms occupied to calculate the statistic thereby including complimentary rooms in the calculation which can change certain operating statistics, such as average room rate etc.  Though using  rooms  sold,  or,  rooms  occupied  both  is  valid,  depending  upon  the needs and history of the property.  (Here in this unit or discussion we will use rooms occupied to illustrate the occupancy percentage calculation).

Sometimes even out-of-order rooms are also included in the number of rooms available as  in  some  properties  FOM evaluates management performance partly  on the basis of occupancy percentage, including out-of-order rooms in the number of rooms available, as  it  provides  the  manager  with  chance  to  get  those  rooms  fixed  and  recycled  more quickly.   Including  all  rooms  also  provides  a  consistent  base  on  which  to  measure occupancy. While on other hand, not including out-of-order rooms may allow managers to artificially increase the calculated occupancy percentage simply by mentioning unsold rooms as out-of-order.  Some properties do not include out-of-order rooms because these rooms  are  not  available  for  sale  as,  occupancy  percentage  is  required  to  evaluate  the

performance of front office staff that is having no control over out-of-order rooms, and including  those  rooms  may  unfairly  penalize  the  front  office  staff.  Regardless  of  the approach chosen, it should be used consistently. The occupancy percentage for the Hotel is calculated as follows:

𝐎𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐲 % = 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦 𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐩𝐢𝐞𝐝 𝐍𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦𝐬 𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 ×𝟏𝟎𝟎

Multiple  Occupancy  Ratio: The  multiple  occupancy  ratio  which  is  also  sometimes called as double occupancy ratio, may not always be accurate, it is used to forecast food and beverage revenue, indicate clean linen requirements, and analyze average daily room rates.   Multiple  occupancy  can  be  calculated  by  determining  a  multiple  occupancy percentage or by determining the average number of guests per room or occupied (also called the occupancy multiplier or the multiple occupancy factor).

Average Daily Rate: Average Daily rate commonly referred to as ADR is a statistical unit  which  gives  average  rental  income  per  occupied  room  for  a  given  period.  It  is calculated by dividing Total revenue generated in a specific duration of time by the total number of rooms sold in that duration.

Average Room Rate Per Guest: It is also called as ARG and is calculated by dividing the  total  room  revenue  by  the  total  number  of  guest  in  the  hotels  including  children above  5yrs  of  age. Resort  hotels,  in  particular,  are  often  interested  in  knowing  the average rate per guest (ARG).

Rooms Revenue Analysis :Front office staff members are expected to sell rooms at the rack rate unless a guest  qualifies for an authorized discounted room rate. A room rate variance report mention those rooms that have been sold at the price other than the rack rates. One way for front office managers to Evaluating Front Office Operations and the sales effectiveness of the front office staff is to generate yield statistic, which is actual rooms revenue as a percentage of potential rooms revenue and the other method is by comparing the hotel's actual average rate to an ideal average rate.

## 𝒀𝒊𝒆𝒍𝒅 = 𝑨𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆 𝑷𝒐𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝑹𝒐𝒐𝒎  𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏𝒖𝒆

Ideal Average Rate (IAR): This indicates the point at which rooms are sold at the best rate for the type of guest accommodated by the property.

The  Hotel  Income  Statement  : This  informs  the  amount  of  net  income  for  a  given period and is very important financial statement which helps in evaluating Front Office Operations for a given period of time The hotel's income statement provides important financial  information  about  the  results  of  hotel  operations.  This  period  may  be  one month  or  longer  but  should  not  exceed  more  than  one  business  year.  The  hotel's statement of income is also called a consolidated income statement because it presents a complete picture of all the hotel's financial operations.

It  is  an  important financial indicator of operational success and profitability. The hotel income statement relies  on  detailed  FO  information  that  is  supplied  through  the  room schedule or room division income statement. The amount of income generated by the rooms  division  is  determined  by  subtracting  payroll  and  related  expenses  and  other expanses from the amount of  net revenue produced by the room division over the period covered  by  income  statement,  Payroll    expenses  charged  to  the  room  division  may include those associated with the front office manager and staff and reservation manager and staff and housekeepers and uniformed service staff as the Revenue generated by the rooms division is usually the largest single amount produced by revenue center with in a hotel

The Rooms Schedule/ Room Division income statement : The hotel's income statement shows only summary information of the revenue generated by the hotel as a whole. The separate departmental income statements prepared by each revenue center provide more detail.  The  room  division  is  the  profit  centre  so  the  room  division  budget  is  concerned with planning to maximize revenue sand minimize expanses. This statement specifies the desired  sales  goals  that  are  basis  for  planning  expanses  and  capital  expenditures refurbishing expanses, increasing supplies inventory etc. Departmental income statements

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

are also called as ‗Schedules' and are referenced on the hotel's statement of income and are prepared by the hotel's account section and not by the front office staff. By carefully analyzing  and  reviewing  the  room  division  income  statement  the  front  office  manager may be able to develop the action plan to improve the division's financial  condition and services etc. for example the income statement may indicate that phone revenue is down due to the high long distance surcharge being charged from the guest thereby the analysis reveals that guest are making fewer calls because the cost per call was  increased by the surcharge.  Therefore  even  though  the  revenue  per  call  may  have  increased,  overall telephone revenues have decreased.

Room Division Budget Reports : It is said that no system of planning can be successful if  it  is  not  having  an  effective  and  efficient  system  of  control.  Budgeting  is  closely connected  with  control.  The  exercise  of  control  in  the  organization  with  the  help  of budget  is  known  as  budgetary  control.  The  hotel's  accounting  division  also  prepares monthly budget reports that compare actual revenue and expense figures with budgeted amounts.  These  reports  can  provide  timely  information  for  evaluating  front  office operations. Front office performances are often judged according to how favorably the rooms division's monthly income and expense figures compare with budgeted amounts. A typical budget report format should include both monthly variances and year to date variances for all budget items. The process of budgetary control is:

-  Preparation of various budgets
-  Continuous comparison of actual performance with budgetary performance.
-  Revision of budgets in the light of changed circumstances

A  system  of  budgetary  control  should  not  be  rigid.  There  should  be  enough  scope  of flexibility to make individual initiative and drive. Budgetary control is an effective tool for making the organization more efficient on all fronts. it is an important tool for keeping control on cost and helping achieving overall objective of the organization.

Operating Ratios : It measures the relationship between the revenues and expenses and units  of  inputs  and  outputs,  thereby  assists  managers  in  evaluating  the  success  of  front office  operations.  Operating  ratios  are  compared  against  proper  standard-  budgeted percentage  and  any  significant  variances  can  be  identified  i.e.  it  helps  to  identifies  the areas where management must work so as to achieve budgetary goals.

Payroll and related expenses or labour cost tends to be the largest single expenses for the room division as well as for the entire hotel. For control, labor costs must be analyzed on a departmental basis as Room sales fluctuates but payroll and related expenses relatively remains  constant  Hence  any  differences  between  actual  and  budgeted  labor  cost percentages must be carefully identified. it is obtained by dividing the payroll and related expenses by the room division's net room revenue yields.

Ratio  standards: Operating  ratios  becomes  meaningful  when  compared  against  useful criteria such as:

-  Planed ratio goals
-  Corresponding historical ratios
-  Industry averages

## Front Office Management                                                                                     HM-202

Ratios are best compared against planned ratios goals. For eg in order to more effectively control  labour  costs  a  front  office  manager  may  project  a  goal  for  the  current  month's labour cost percentage that is slightly lower than the previous months the expectation of lower labour  cost  percentage  may  reflect  the  front  office  manager's  efforts  to  improve scheduling  procedures  and  other  factors  related  to  the  cost  labour.  By  comparing  the actual labour cost percentage with the planned goal, the manager can measure the success of  his  efforts  to  control  labour  cost.  Ratio  standards  are  only  indicators  and  not  the solution  ,as,  When  ratios  vary  significantly  form  planned  goals,  previous  results,  or industrial average's, they indicate that their exist any problem and as they do not solve problems or necessarily reveal the source of a problem More analysis and investigations are required to be done to determine appropriate corrective actions.

## 5.6 Summary

Price or rates are one of the major element involved in selecting the particular hotel so while  selecting  the  price,  hotel  should  be  very  careful  and  should  cover  the  cost  of production and overheads and should include a fair amount of profit so that hotel business remain sustainable and profitable as the rooms of the hotel generates maximum revenues so an accurate and accurate and competitive room rent is one of the essential requirement of  the  hotel  thus  apart  from  standard  rates  hotels  also  offer  discounted  rates  to  attract business from multiple market segments for eg seasonal rate, package rate etc. There are two standard methods for establishing room tariff cost based pricing and market based pricing and as compared to market based pricing cost based pricing is more scientific and practical as it take into consideration factors like rate of return on investment, operating cost overhead and profit etc.

Forecasting  future  demand  in  the  lodging  industry  is  crucial  because  it  leads  to  an efficient planning for, and decision making to all the departments, and most importantly it is  one  of  the  drivers  of  pricing:  inaccurate  forecasts  or  predictions  will  diminish  the hotel's revenues and profit margin. In fact, a 10% improvement in forecasting accuracy translates  into  a  1.5  to  3%  increase  in  revenue  generated  from  a  revenue  management system. This will probably impact the net income in a much larger way, due to the small margins  existing  in  the  hotel  industry.  Therefore,  in  addressing  the  importance  of forecasts,  one  can  state  that  forecasting  is  the  most  important  driver  of  any  revenue management optimization approach.

It  is  important  for  all  those  related  to  the  hotel  and  the  managers  must  continuously evaluate  and  assess  the  performance  of  the  hotel  with  respect  to  revenue  generation. Hotels  measures  their  performance  by  calculating  occupancy  ratios,  average  daily  rate, average room rate per guest, rev par etc, this helps them to plan for future.
