            "The tourism and hospitality industry is a key driver of the global economy creating 109 million jobs and contributing $2.3 trillion (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2017). This equates to 10.2% of the world ' s GDP and sees 1 in 10 jobs being tourism and hospitality related (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2017). In Australia, the hotel industry is worth $14 billion annually employing 380,000 employees across 6807 hotels in Australia (Australia Hotel Association, 2015). The Australian Tourism Labour Force Report forecasts demand for hospitality workers to grow by 123,000 (including 60,000 skilled workers) by 2020 (Deloitte, 2015). This strong predicted growth opens up numerous hospitality career opportunities highlighting the crucial need for quali /uniFB01 ed and well-trained hospitality graduates who will be of value to the coming development of the hospitality industry. Despite the prevalent and prominent issue of high workforce turnover in the hospitality industry, several researchers (Richardson, 2009) have reported that hotel managers are still not doing enough to keep hospitality graduates motivated to remain in the industry such as a lack of career planning and progression opportunities, and often see them as cheap labour where the hospitality sector is one of the lowest paid industry (Casado-D\u00edaz and Sim\u00f3n, 2016).

            "Hospitality institutions have an obligation to address the industry workforce gap through the delivery of curriculum and training critical for preparing students to progress into their hospitality career (Raybould and Wilkins, 2006). To maximise employability, graduate attributes must be current and desired by the hospitality industry (Su and Feng, 2008). Numerous researchers have studied the attitudes of hospitality students towards pursuing a hospitality-related career (Chan et al., 2002; Richardson, 2009; Solnet et al., 2012; Hertzman et al., 2015). Majority of past studies focused on the attitudes of ' Generation Y', who have mostly graduated from their undergraduate or postgraduate program and moved on to employment. Other studies such as Hertzman et al. (2015) explored the characteristics of Millennials hospitality management students. However, there is a lack of research aimed towards Generation Z, the generation that will feed into the hospitality workforce in the near future. According to Davidson et al. (2011), the generational change in the hospitality workforce implies di /uniFB00 erent work attitudes that will a /uniFB00 ect Human Resource Management in the hospitality industry. For example, Generation X are more concerned about the social climate, whereas Generational Y are more motivated by career development and job content (Lub et al., 2016) This echoes the statement by Gursoy et al. (2008) about the di /uniFB00 erent characteristics, skill sets, and values portrayed by each generation. Oliver (2006) compared the work expectations of Generation Y with the generations before and found an increase in expectations in regards to pay, work conditions, promotion and career advancement.\n\nHospitality careers have always been labeled as low-paying, seasonal, repetitive, stressful, odd working hours as well as being physically and emotionally demanding (Richardson, 2009; Solnet et al., 2012; Barron et al., 2014; Gan, 2016; Mooney, 2016; Nyanjom and Wilkins, 2016; Robinson et al., 2016), which could be possible factors deterring graduates from applying for a job in the industry. For\n\nexample, hospitality workers in Malaysia had little con /uniFB01 dence that even with the introduction of a minimum wage policy, salary levels and working conditions will not improve in the hospitality industry (Gan, 2016). Richardson and Butler (2012) found tourism and hospitality students to perceive the industry lacking appeal as a career path as it does not ful /uniFB01 ll many of the important factors in a career. It was also highlighted by Leal-Muniz and Constantine (2005) that students ' perception of career barriers is a factor leading to the rejection of certain career choices. Furthermore, there is tension from older hospitality workers not appreciating and seeing younger hospitality workers with having little value and work experience (Mooney, 2016). It is important for hospitality employers to recognize Generation Z ' s needs and expectations of the job, thus enticing them to join the hospitality workforce. As mentioned by Chacko et al. (2012), Human Resource Managers need to anticipate attitudes, desires, characteristics and skills of upcoming generations as they make up majority of the new hires.\n\n",

            "Hospitality institutions have an obligation to address the industry workforce gap through the delivery of curriculum and training critical for preparing students to progress into their hospitality career (Raybould and Wilkins, 2006). To maximise employability, graduate attributes must be current and desired by the hospitality industry (Su and Feng, 2008). Numerous researchers have studied the attitudes of hospitality students towards pursuing a hospitality-related career (Chan et al., 2002; Richardson, 2009; Solnet et al., 2012; Hertzman et al., 2015). Majority of past studies focused on the attitudes of ' Generation Y', who have mostly graduated from their undergraduate or postgraduate program and moved on to employment. Other studies such as Hertzman et al. (2015) explored the characteristics of Millennials hospitality management students. However, there is a lack of research aimed towards Generation Z, the generation that will feed into the hospitality workforce in the near future. According to Davidson et al. (2011), the generational change in the hospitality workforce implies di /uniFB00 erent work attitudes that will a /uniFB00 ect Human Resource Management in the hospitality industry. For example, Generation X are more concerned about the social climate, whereas Generational Y are more motivated by career development and job content (Lub et al., 2016) This echoes the statement by Gursoy et al. (2008) about the di /uniFB00 erent characteristics, skill sets, and values portrayed by each generation. Oliver (2006) compared the work expectations of Generation Y with the generations before and found an increase in expectations in regards to pay, work conditions, promotion and career advancement.\n\nHospitality careers have always been labeled as low-paying, seasonal, repetitive, stressful, odd working hours as well as being physically and emotionally demanding (Richardson, 2009; Solnet et al., 2012; Barron et al., 2014; Gan, 2016; Mooney, 2016; Nyanjom and Wilkins, 2016; Robinson et al., 2016), which could be possible factors deterring graduates from applying for a job in the industry. For\n\nexample, hospitality workers in Malaysia had little con /uniFB01 dence that even with the introduction of a minimum wage policy, salary levels and working conditions will not improve in the hospitality industry (Gan, 2016). Richardson and Butler (2012) found tourism and hospitality students to perceive the industry lacking appeal as a career path as it does not ful /uniFB01 ll many of the important factors in a career. It was also highlighted by Leal-Muniz and Constantine (2005) that students ' perception of career barriers is a factor leading to the rejection of certain career choices. Furthermore, there is tension from older hospitality workers not appreciating and seeing younger hospitality workers with having little value and work experience (Mooney, 2016). It is important for hospitality employers to recognize Generation Z ' s needs and expectations of the job, thus enticing them to join the hospitality workforce. As mentioned by Chacko et al. (2012), Human Resource Managers need to anticipate attitudes, desires, characteristics and skills of upcoming generations as they make up majority of the new hires.\n\n",
